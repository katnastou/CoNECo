prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: DNA-directed RNA polymerases. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: This study aimed to investigate the regulatory mechanisms of DNA-directed RNA polymerases in the context of inflammatory response in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. The expression levels of DNA-directed RNA polymerases were found to be significantly upregulated in synovial tissues of affected individuals compared to healthy controls. Furthermore, analysis of post-translational modifications revealed increased phosphorylation of RNA polymerase subunits in response to pro-inflammatory cytokines, suggesting a potential role of these modifications in transcriptional activation of inflammatory mediators. Inhibition of RNA polymerase activity using a specific small molecule inhibitor attenuated the production of inflammatory cytokines in synovial fibroblasts, highlighting the significance of DNA-directed RNA polymerases in the pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis. These findings shed light on the potential therapeutic implications of targeting RNA polymerase activity in the treatment of inflammatory diseases.
