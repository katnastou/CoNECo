prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: glomerular endothelial cell fenestrations. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In the context of diabetic nephropathy, the alterations in glomerular endothelial cell fenestrations have been implicated in the pathogenesis of albuminuria. Studies have shown that hyperglycemia and oxidative stress play crucial roles in the disruption of glomerular endothelial cell fenestrations, leading to increased permeability and subsequent leakage of albumin into the urine. Furthermore, these changes are associated with the activation of inflammatory pathways and the upregulation of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), which further exacerbate the damage to the glomerular filtration barrier. Understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying the maintenance and disruption of glomerular endothelial cell fenestrations is essential for developing targeted therapeutic interventions to mitigate albuminuria and attenuate the progression of diabetic nephropathy.
