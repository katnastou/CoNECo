prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: WASH. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The WASH complex is a critically important regulator of cellular homeostasis and trafficking processes. Recent studies have implicated the WASH complex in the pathogenesis of various neurological disorders, such as Parkinson's disease, as well as in the development and progression of certain types of cancer. Dysfunction of the WASH complex has also been associated with defects in endosomal recycling and lysosomal degradation, highlighting its pivotal role in maintaining cellular function and integrity. Further investigation of the molecular mechanisms underlying the function of the WASH complex may provide valuable insights for the development of targeted therapeutic strategies for the treatment of these debilitating conditions.
