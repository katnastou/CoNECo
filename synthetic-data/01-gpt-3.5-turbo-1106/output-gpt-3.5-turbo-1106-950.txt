prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: NAD(P)H-dependent glutamate dehydrogenase. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we investigated the role of the NAD(P)H-dependent glutamate dehydrogenase (NAD(P)H-GDH) in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease. Using a rat model, we observed elevated levels of NAD(P)H-GDH in the substantia nigra, a region of the brain associated with dopaminergic neuron degeneration. Additionally, we identified a correlation between NAD(P)H-GDH activity and oxidative stress markers, suggesting a potential link between NAD(P)H-GDH dysregulation and oxidative damage in Parkinson's disease. Our findings provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying the neurodegenerative process in Parkinson's disease and highlight NAD(P)H-GDH as a potential target for therapeutic intervention.
