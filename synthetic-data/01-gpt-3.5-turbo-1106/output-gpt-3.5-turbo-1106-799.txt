prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: CDK8 kinase module. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The CDK8 kinase module plays a crucial role in the regulation of gene transcription. Studies have shown that dysregulation of the CDK8 kinase module activity is associated with various diseases, including colorectal cancer and neurodegenerative disorders. The module's interaction with cyclin C has been found to be essential for its function, and small molecule inhibitors targeting this interaction have shown promise in preclinical models. Furthermore, the complex interplay between the CDK8 kinase module and various signaling pathways, such as the Wnt signaling pathway, underscores its significance in cellular homeostasis and disease pathogenesis. Understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying the function of the CDK8 kinase module may offer insights into novel therapeutic strategies for diseases associated with its dysregulation.
