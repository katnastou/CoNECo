prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: 5-hydroxyisourate hydrolase. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The 5-hydroxyisourate hydrolase (5-HIUH) is a key enzyme involved in the purine metabolism pathway, which plays a critical role in the production and elimination of uric acid. Dysregulation of uric acid levels has been linked to conditions such as gout and hyperuricemia, highlighting the importance of understanding the function of 5-HIUH in maintaining homeostasis. Recent studies have revealed potential interactions between 5-HIUH and various chemical compounds, including uric acid derivatives and purine analogs, suggesting potential applications in drug development for managing conditions related to uric acid imbalance. Furthermore, investigations into the cellular localization and expression patterns of 5-HIUH in different organisms have provided valuable insights into its evolutionary conservation and potential therapeutic targets for related disorders. This research underscores the significance of elucidating the mechanistic insights and physiological implications of 5-HIUH, paving the way for developing interventions targeting purine metabolism-related diseases.
