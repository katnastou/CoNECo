prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: pre-BCR. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The pre-BCR plays a crucial role in the development of B cells and has been identified as a potential therapeutic target in lymphoid malignancies. In this study, we investigated the effects of small molecule inhibitors on pre-BCR signaling and observed a substantial reduction in the survival and proliferation of B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) cells. Furthermore, we demonstrated that inhibition of pre-BCR activity led to a decrease in the expression of key survival proteins and increased sensitivity to chemotherapy in preclinical models. These findings suggest that targeting the pre-BCR may hold promise for the treatment of B-ALL and other B cell malignancies, highlighting the potential for developing novel therapeutic strategies aimed at disrupting pre-BCR signaling pathways.
