prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: ABI. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we investigated the potential role of ABI in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease. Our findings demonstrate a significant upregulation of ABI expression in the hippocampus of Alzheimer's disease patients compared to age-matched controls. Furthermore, our in vitro experiments using human neuronal cell lines revealed that ABI inhibition led to a reduction in amyloid-beta production and tau hyperphosphorylation, two hallmark features of Alzheimer's disease. These results point to a potential involvement of ABI in the pathological processes underlying Alzheimer's disease, suggesting that further exploration of ABI as a therapeutic target may hold promise for the development of novel interventions against this devastating neurodegenerative disorder.
