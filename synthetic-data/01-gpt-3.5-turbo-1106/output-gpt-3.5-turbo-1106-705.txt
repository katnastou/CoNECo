prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: Hydrogenase 4. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we investigated the function of the Hydrogenase 4 protein complex in the context of microbial metabolism. Our findings reveal a novel interaction between Hydrogenase 4 and a specific chemical signal transduction pathway in the bacterium Escherichia coli. Furthermore, we observed a significant alteration in the growth pattern of E. coli strains lacking the Hydrogenase 4 gene, suggesting a potential role of this protein complex in the pathogenesis of gastrointestinal diseases. These insights into the molecular mechanisms of Hydrogenase 4 provide a foundation for further studies aimed at elucidating its potential contribution to the pathophysiology of bacterial infections.
