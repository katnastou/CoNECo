prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: editosome. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The editosome is a multi-subunit protein complex that plays a crucial role in the post-transcriptional modification of messenger RNA (mRNA) in trypanosomes, the causative agents of important tropical diseases such as African sleeping sickness and Chagas disease. This complex consists of several ribonucleoprotein components that coordinate the insertion and deletion of uridine nucleotides, a process known as RNA editing, which is essential for the generation of functional mitochondrial mRNAs. Dysregulation of editosome activity is associated with severe mitochondrial dysfunction and decreased organismal fitness, highlighting the vital role of this complex in the pathogenesis of these devastating diseases. Elucidating the molecular mechanisms underlying the function and regulation of the editosome is of great significance for the development of potential therapeutic interventions against these neglected tropical diseases.
