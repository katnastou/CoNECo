prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: glycine-gated chloride channel. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The glycine-gated chloride channel is a pentameric ligand-gated ion channel that plays a crucial role in mediating inhibitory neurotransmission in the central nervous system. Recent studies have elucidated the structural and functional properties of this protein complex, shedding light on its contribution to disorders such as hyperekplexia and spastic disorders. Allosteric modulators targeting the glycine-gated chloride channel have shown promise as potential therapeutic agents for the treatment of these neurological conditions. Furthermore, investigations into the physiological regulation of this channel in different brain regions and cell types have provided insights into its diverse roles in synaptic transmission, neuronal excitability, and neurodevelopment. The unique pharmacological and physiological characteristics of the glycine-gated chloride channel make it an attractive target for further research aiming to develop novel interventions for neurological diseases.
