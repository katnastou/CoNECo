prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: DNA polymerase Vs. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, the interaction between the DNA polymerase Vs complex and influenza virus infection was investigated in lung epithelial cells. Our results showed that the expression levels of DNA polymerase Vs were significantly upregulated in response to influenza virus infection, suggesting its potential role in the cellular response to viral invasion. Furthermore, the silencing of DNA polymerase Vs using siRNA resulted in a decrease in viral replication and release, indicating the importance of this complex in viral replication and propagation. These findings shed light on the intricate interplay between DNA polymerase Vs and influenza virus infection, highlighting the potential of targeting this complex as a therapeutic strategy for combating viral respiratory diseases.
