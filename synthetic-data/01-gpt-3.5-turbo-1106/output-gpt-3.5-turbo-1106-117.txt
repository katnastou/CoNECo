prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: CMA translocation. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The CMA translocation protein complex has been implicated in various pathophysiological processes, including the development and progression of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's. Notably, dysregulation of CMA translocation has been observed in mouse models of neurodegenerative disorders, suggesting a potential role in disease pathogenesis. Furthermore, recent studies have highlighted the involvement of CMA translocation in the clearance of toxic protein aggregates in the cytoplasm, indicating its importance in maintaining cellular homeostasis. Given the emerging significance of CMA translocation in neurodegenerative diseases, further investigation into its molecular mechanisms and potential therapeutic targeting is warranted.
