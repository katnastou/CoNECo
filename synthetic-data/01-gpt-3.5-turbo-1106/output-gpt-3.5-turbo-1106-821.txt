prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: complex III. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The mitochondrial electron transport chain (ETC) is a vital molecular machinery involved in energy production and oxidative phosphorylation. Dysfunction of ETC complexes can lead to various human diseases, including neurodegenerative disorders and metabolic syndromes. Complex III, also known as the bc1 complex or the ubiquinol-cytochrome c reductase, is a key enzyme in the ETC responsible for transferring electrons from ubiquinol to cytochrome c. Dysregulation of complex III activity has been implicated in a range of pathologies, such as Leigh syndrome and hepatocellular carcinoma. Understanding the regulatory mechanisms and structural features of complex III will provide valuable insights into the development of targeted therapies for ETC-related disorders.
