prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: DPNH-coenzyme Q reductase. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we investigated the role of the DPNH-coenzyme Q reductase in the context of Parkinson's disease progression. We conducted experiments using cellular models to elucidate the impact of this protein complex on mitochondrial function and oxidative stress. Our findings reveal a potential link between dysfunction of the DPNH-coenzyme Q reductase and the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease, suggesting a novel mechanism for the observed mitochondrial impairment in affected neuronal populations. This research provides insights into the molecular underpinnings of Parkinson's disease and sheds light on potential therapeutic targets for mitigating disease progression.
