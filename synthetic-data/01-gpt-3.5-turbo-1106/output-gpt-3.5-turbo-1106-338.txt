prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: alpha-beta T cell receptor. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The alpha-beta T cell receptor is a critical component of the immune system, responsible for recognizing and binding to antigens presented by major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules on the surface of antigen-presenting cells. Dysregulation of the alpha-beta T cell receptor signaling has been implicated in various autoimmune diseases, including rheumatoid arthritis and multiple sclerosis. Recent studies have focused on the role of interleukins in modulating the activation and function of the alpha-beta T cell receptor, providing potential targets for therapeutic intervention. Furthermore, aberrant expression of the alpha-beta T cell receptor has been observed in certain types of cancer, suggesting its potential as a biomarker for disease progression and prognosis. Further investigation into the intricate signaling pathways involving the alpha-beta T cell receptor is critical for understanding its role in immune function and disease pathogenesis.
