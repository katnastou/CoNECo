prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: network-forming collagen trimers. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: Recent studies have highlighted the pivotal role of network-forming collagen trimers in the pathogenesis of fibrosis. Aberrant deposition of these collagen trimers in the extracellular matrix has been implicated in the progression of various fibrotic disorders, including pulmonary fibrosis, liver cirrhosis, and systemic sclerosis. The dysregulation of collagen trimer assembly has been found to promote tissue stiffness and aberrant wound healing, ultimately leading to organ dysfunction and failure. Understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying the formation and regulation of these collagen trimers holds great promise for the development of targeted therapies aimed at mitigating fibrotic processes and improving patient outcomes.
