prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: UTP-A. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The molecular chaperone UTP-A has been shown to play a crucial role in the regulation of ribosome biogenesis in eukaryotic cells. Recent studies have implicated UTP-A in the assembly and maturation of the small subunit (SSU) processome, a key early intermediate in the ribosome assembly pathway. It has also been suggested that UTP-A may interact with specific chemical modulators, leading to alterations in its functional activity. Furthermore, the dysregulation of UTP-A has been linked to various human diseases, including certain types of cancers and developmental disorders. Therefore, a comprehensive understanding of the structure, function, and regulation of UTP-A is essential for the development of potential therapeutic interventions targeting ribosome biogenesis-related pathologies.
