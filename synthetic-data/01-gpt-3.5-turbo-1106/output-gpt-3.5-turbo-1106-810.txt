prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4F. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: Eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4F (eIF4F) is a critical complex involved in the regulation of protein translation in eukaryotic cells. Dysregulation of eIF4F has been implicated in several diseases, including cancer and neurodevelopmental disorders. The interaction between eIF4F and eIF4E, a subunit of the complex, has been a focus of research due to its potential as a therapeutic target. Recent studies have investigated the role of small molecule inhibitors in modulating the function of eIF4F, with promising results in preclinical models. Furthermore, the complex interplay between eIF4F and signaling pathways, such as the mTOR pathway, highlights the complexity of its regulatory mechanisms. Understanding the precise molecular mechanisms governing eIF4F function has the potential to uncover novel therapeutic strategies for diseases associated with aberrant protein translation.
