prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: cargo-selective retromer subcomplex. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The cargo-selective retromer subcomplex has emerged as a crucial player in the intracellular trafficking of transmembrane proteins, impacting the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease. Recent studies have illuminated the involvement of this protein complex in the retrieval and recycling of integral membrane proteins from endosomes to the trans-Golgi network, thereby influencing cellular physiology. Importantly, disruptions in the function of the cargo-selective retromer subcomplex have been implicated in the dysregulation of key signaling pathways, leading to aberrant protein accumulation and neuronal dysfunction. Understanding the intricate mechanisms governing the activity of this subcomplex may provide novel insights into the etiology and potential therapeutic strategies for neurodegenerative diseases.
