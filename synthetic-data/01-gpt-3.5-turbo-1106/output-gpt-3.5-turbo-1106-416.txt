prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: tRNA-intron endonucleases. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: A key step in the splicing of tRNA precursors involves the activity of tRNA-intron endonucleases. These endonucleases are pivotal in the removal of intervening sequences from pre-tRNA molecules, allowing for the maturation of functional tRNAs. Mutations in the genes encoding tRNA-intron endonucleases have been associated with various human diseases, including neurodegenerative disorders and metabolic syndromes. Understanding the intricate mechanisms underlying the function of tRNA-intron endonucleases is critical for elucidating the pathogenesis of these conditions and for the development of potential therapeutic interventions. Additionally, the study of tRNA-intron endonucleases holds promise for uncovering novel insights into RNA splicing processes, with potential implications for broader areas of RNA biology and disease.
