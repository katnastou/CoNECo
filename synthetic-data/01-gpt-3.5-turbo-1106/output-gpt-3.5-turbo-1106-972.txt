prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: Reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide-coenzyme Q reductase. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we investigated the role of Reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide-coenzyme Q reductase in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease in a mouse model. Our results show that the activity of Reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide-coenzyme Q reductase is significantly reduced in the substantia nigra region of the brain in Parkinson's disease mice compared to controls. This reduction in activity is concurrent with impaired mitochondrial function and increased oxidative stress, indicating a potential link between Reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide-coenzyme Q reductase dysfunction and Parkinson's disease pathology. Further elucidation of the molecular mechanisms underlying the involvement of Reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide-coenzyme Q reductase in Parkinson's disease may provide new insights for the development of targeted therapies.
