prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: decaprenyl diphosphate synthase. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we investigate the potential role of the decaprenyl diphosphate synthase (DDS) protein complex in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis, a chronic inflammatory disease affecting the arterial wall. Atherosclerosis is characterized by the accumulation of lipids and fibrous elements, leading to plaque formation and eventual cardiovascular complications. By utilizing a murine model of atherosclerosis, we demonstrate a significant upregulation of DDS expression in atherosclerotic lesions, suggesting a potential involvement of DDS in the disease process. Further analysis of DDS function and regulation may provide valuable insights into the mechanisms underlying atherosclerosis and unveil potential therapeutic targets for this prevalent cardiovascular disorder.
