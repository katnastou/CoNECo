prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: dolichyl-phosphate-mannose-protein mannosyltransferase. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we investigated the potential role of the dolichyl-phosphate-mannose-protein mannosyltransferase (DPM) complex in the pathogenesis of congenital disorders of glycosylation (CDG). CDG are a group of rare metabolic disorders characterized by defective glycosylation of proteins and lipids. Through a series of in vitro experiments using human cell lines and a mouse model of CDG, we demonstrated that mutations in genes encoding subunits of the DPM complex result in impaired protein glycosylation, leading to a cascade of cellular and metabolic dysregulations. Our findings provide insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying CDG and highlight the therapeutic potential of targeting the DPM complex to ameliorate glycosylation defects. This study contributes to the expanding knowledge of the role of the DPM complex in human disease and may pave the way for future therapeutic interventions for CDG patients.
