prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: CBM. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we aimed to elucidate the role of the CBM complex in mediating inflammatory responses in a murine model of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). We found that the levels of key inflammatory cytokines, such as TNF-Î± and IL-6, were significantly elevated in the synovial tissues of CBM-deficient mice compared to wild-type controls. Furthermore, we observed a marked increase in the infiltration of macrophages and neutrophils within the inflamed joints of CBM-deficient mice, indicative of enhanced inflammatory cell recruitment. Our findings suggest that the CBM complex plays a critical regulatory role in modulating the inflammatory cascade associated with RA pathogenesis, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target for the treatment of this debilitating autoimmune disease.
