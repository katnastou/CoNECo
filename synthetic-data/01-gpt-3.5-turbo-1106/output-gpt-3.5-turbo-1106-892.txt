prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: Xylose ABC transporter. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The Xylose ABC transporter is a crucial molecular entity responsible for the transport of xylose across the cell membrane in various organisms. Dysregulation of the Xylose ABC transporter has been linked to metabolic disorders such as diabetes and obesity due to its role in the uptake of xylose, an essential sugar molecule. Additionally, the Xylose ABC transporter has been identified as a potential target for drug development to modulate glucose metabolism and alleviate the symptoms of metabolic syndrome. Understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying the function and regulation of the Xylose ABC transporter will provide crucial insights into the pathophysiology of metabolic diseases and may lead to the development of novel therapeutic strategies to combat these disorders.
