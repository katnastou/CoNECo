prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: fibrillar collagen trimer. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The fibrillar collagen trimer plays a crucial role in the extracellular matrix of various tissues throughout the body. These collagen trimers are composed of three polypeptide chains intertwined in a triple helical structure, contributing to the tensile strength and flexibility of connective tissues. Dysregulation of fibrillar collagen trimer production has been associated with various connective tissue disorders, including osteogenesis imperfecta and Ehlers-Danlos syndrome. Understanding the assembly and regulation of fibrillar collagen trimers is important for developing therapeutic interventions for these debilitating conditions. Furthermore, the interaction of fibrillar collagen trimers with other extracellular matrix components, such as proteoglycans and elastin, influences tissue function and homeostasis. Investigating the molecular mechanisms underlying fibrillar collagen trimer synthesis and organization will provide valuable insights into tissue development, maintenance, and repair.
