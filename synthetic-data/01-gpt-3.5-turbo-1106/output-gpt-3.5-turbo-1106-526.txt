prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: MMM1. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we aimed to elucidate the role of the MMM1 protein complex in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease. Utilizing a genetically engineered mouse model with MMM1 gene knockout, we observed a significant exacerbation of motor deficits and neurodegeneration compared to wild-type controls. Further analysis revealed an aberrant accumulation of alpha-synuclein and an upregulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines in the substantia nigra of MMM1-deficient mice. Our findings indicate a critical involvement of the MMM1 protein complex in maintaining neuronal homeostasis and protecting against neurodegenerative processes. These results shed light on potential therapeutic targets for Parkinson's disease by modulating the function of the MMM1 complex.
