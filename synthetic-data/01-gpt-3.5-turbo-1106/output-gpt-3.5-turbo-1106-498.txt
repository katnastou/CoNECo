prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: SWItch/Sucrose Non-Fermentable. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The SWItch/Sucrose Non-Fermentable (SWI/SNF) protein complex is a crucial regulator of chromatin remodeling in various eukaryotic organisms. Dysregulation of the SWI/SNF complex has been implicated in several human diseases, including cancer. Recent studies have highlighted the interplay between the SWI/SNF complex and chemical modifications of histones, such as acetylation and methylation, which play a pivotal role in modulating gene expression profiles. Additionally, the involvement of the SWI/SNF complex in maintaining genome stability and its impact on cellular differentiation processes have heightened interest in targeting this complex for therapeutic intervention. Understanding the molecular mechanisms governing the function of the SWI/SNF complex is therefore of paramount importance in elucidating its role in human health and disease.
