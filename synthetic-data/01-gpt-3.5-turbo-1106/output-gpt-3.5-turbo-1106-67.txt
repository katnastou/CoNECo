prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: protein phosphatase 4. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: Protein phosphatase 4 (PP4) is a highly conserved serine/threonine phosphatase involved in the regulation of various cellular processes. Recent studies have implicated PP4 in mediating DNA damage repair and cell cycle progression. The role of PP4 in the development and progression of cancer has also been investigated, with evidence suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target in certain malignancies. Additionally, PP4 has been shown to interact with a variety of regulatory proteins, indicating its involvement in diverse signaling pathways. Dysregulation of PP4 activity has been associated with several human diseases, including neurodegenerative disorders and metabolic syndromes. Further research into the molecular mechanisms governing PP4 function and its potential as a therapeutic target is warranted to elucidate its role in health and disease.
