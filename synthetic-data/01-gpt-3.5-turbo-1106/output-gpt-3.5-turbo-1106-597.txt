model: gpt-3.5-turbo-1106
prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: TRAP-T transporter. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The TRAP-T transporter is a vital membrane protein complex found in various bacteria, playing an essential role in the uptake of tryptophan and signaling as well as regulating gene expression. Research on the TRAP-T transporter has shown its involvement in the transport of various amino acids and biogenic amines, indicating its significance in bacterial metabolic pathways. Furthermore, studies have indicated a potential link between the TRAP-T transporter and quorum sensing systems, suggesting a potential role in bacterial communication and community behavior. The functioning of the TRAP-T transporter is crucial for bacterial survival and pathogenicity, making it a valuable target for the development of antimicrobial agents and potential therapeutic interventions against bacterial infections. Understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying the function of the TRAP-T transporter could provide valuable insights for the development of novel treatment strategies for bacterial-related diseases.
