prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: NatC. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: A growing body of research has elucidated the role of the NatC protein complex in the regulation of protein acetylation in various organisms. The NatC complex, comprised of NAA30 and NAA35 subunits, has been implicated in diverse cellular processes, including cell cycle progression, cellular differentiation, and apoptosis. Recent studies have identified a putative role for the NatC complex in the pathogenesis of certain neurological disorders, such as Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease. Furthermore, the ability of small molecule inhibitors to modulate the activity of NatC complex highlights the potential for therapeutic targeting of this protein complex in the treatment of cancer and neurodegenerative diseases. Overall, these findings underscore the importance of further investigating the molecular mechanisms underlying the function of the NatC complex and its potential as a target for novel therapeutic interventions.
