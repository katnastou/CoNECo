prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: nucleopores. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The nuclear envelope regulates the trafficking of macromolecules between the nucleus and cytoplasm through multiprotein assemblies called nucleopores. Dysregulation of nucleopore function has been implicated in various human diseases, including neurodegenerative disorders and cancer. In this study, we investigated the role of nucleopores in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease. We demonstrated that amyloid beta, a key player in Alzheimer's disease, disrupts nucleopore integrity, leading to impaired nucleocytoplasmic transport of essential factors involved in neuronal function and survival. Our findings provide new insights into the contribution of nucleopores to the pathophysiology of Alzheimer's disease and suggest potential therapeutic strategies targeting nucleopore function for the treatment of this devastating neurodegenerative disorder.
