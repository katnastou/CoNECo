prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: Amiloride-sensitive sodium channel, ENaC. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The amiloride-sensitive sodium channel, ENaC, is a critical player in maintaining sodium balance and blood pressure regulation within the human body. Dysregulation of ENaC has been associated with hypertension, Liddle's syndrome, and cystic fibrosis. The pharmacological manipulation of ENaC with amiloride and its derivatives has been a common therapeutic approach for these conditions. More recently, studies have uncovered the potential in targeting ENaC for the treatment of pulmonary edema by reducing sodium transport in the lung epithelium. As the role of ENaC in various physiological and pathological processes becomes clearer, further research into its functional regulation and potential therapeutic targeting is warranted.
