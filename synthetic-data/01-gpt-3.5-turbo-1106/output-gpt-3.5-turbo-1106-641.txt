prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: MARS. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we investigated the role of the MARS protein complex in the pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Using a mouse model of RA, we observed a significant upregulation of MARS in the synovial tissue of affected joints compared to healthy controls. Furthermore, our findings revealed a strong correlation between MARS levels and disease severity, as assessed by joint swelling and histological scoring. Mechanistic analyses demonstrated that MARS promotes the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and the activation of immune cells, thereby exacerbating the inflammatory response in RA. Importantly, pharmacological inhibition of MARS activity alleviated arthritis symptoms and reduced joint damage in our preclinical model. This research sheds new light on the pivotal role of the MARS protein complex in RA pathogenesis, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target for this debilitating autoimmune disease.
