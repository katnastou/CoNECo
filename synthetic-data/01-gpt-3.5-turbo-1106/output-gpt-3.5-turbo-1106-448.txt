prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: Biotin-dependent acetyl-coenzyme A carboxylase. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we investigated the role of Biotin-dependent acetyl-coenzyme A carboxylase in the regulation of lipid metabolism in obese mice. We first confirmed the expression of this protein complex in the liver and adipose tissue using immunohistochemistry. Subsequently, we administered a Biotin-dependent acetyl-coenzyme A carboxylase inhibitor to the mice and observed significant changes in the levels of triglycerides and cholesterol in the serum. Moreover, we found that inhibition of this protein complex led to a decrease in the expression of lipogenic genes in the liver. Our findings suggest that targeting Biotin-dependent acetyl-coenzyme A carboxylase may be a promising strategy for managing dyslipidemia and related metabolic disorders in obese individuals.
