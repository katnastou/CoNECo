prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: proteasomes. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: Proteasomes play a critical role in the degradation of intracellular proteins and maintenance of cellular homeostasis. Dysregulation of proteasome function has been implicated in various pathological conditions, including neurodegenerative disorders, such as Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease. The inhibition of proteasome activity has been shown to lead to the accumulation of misfolded and damaged proteins, contributing to the pathogenesis of these disorders. Furthermore, proteasome inhibitors have emerged as promising therapeutic agents for the treatment of certain cancers, by triggering apoptosis in cancer cells. Studies have also suggested that proteasome inhibitors may have potential in the management of autoimmune diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis. Understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying proteasome function and modulation may provide valuable insights for the development of novel therapeutic strategies targeting proteasome activity.
