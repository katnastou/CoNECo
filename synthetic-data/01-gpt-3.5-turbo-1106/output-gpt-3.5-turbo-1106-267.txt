prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: surface IgD. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we investigated the role of the surface IgD protein complex in the context of B cell development and autoimmune diseases. We examined the interaction between surface IgD and its cognate antigens in the context of antigen presentation and immune response. Utilizing a murine model, we observed a differential expression pattern of surface IgD in various stages of B cell maturation, implicating its potential role in mediating B cell activation and differentiation. Furthermore, we analyzed the impact of surface IgD dysregulation in the development of autoimmune disorders, demonstrating a potential link between its aberrant function and the pathogenesis of systemic lupus erythematosus. Our findings suggest that surface IgD may serve as a critical regulator of immune responses and have implications for the development of targeted therapies for autoimmune diseases.
