prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: cullin-RING ligase 5. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In the present study, we investigated the role of cullin-RING ligase 5 (CRL5) in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease. Our research explored the interaction between CRL5 and alpha-synuclein, a key player in the neurodegenerative cascade associated with Parkinson's disease. We demonstrated that CRL5 mediates the ubiquitination and subsequent degradation of alpha-synuclein in neuronal cells. Furthermore, pharmacological inhibition of CRL5 using compound XYZ resulted in the accumulation of alpha-synuclein and exacerbated neurotoxicity in a cellular model of Parkinson's disease. Our findings highlight the potential of targeting CRL5 as a new therapeutic strategy for modulating alpha-synuclein pathology and mitigating the progression of Parkinson's disease.
