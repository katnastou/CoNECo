prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: MsbA transporters. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The role of MsbA transporters in antibiotic resistance remains a focus of investigation in the field of microbial pathogenesis. Previous studies have established a link between the overexpression of MsbA transporters and multidrug resistance in various pathogenic bacteria, including Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Escherichia coli. In addition, recent work has elucidated the impact of MsbA transporters on the efflux of lipopolysaccharides, highlighting their potential implication in the development of resistance to multiple antibiotic classes. A thorough understanding of the mechanisms underlying MsbA transporter-mediated antibiotic resistance is crucial for the development of novel therapeutics targeting this vital component of bacterial virulence and persistence.
