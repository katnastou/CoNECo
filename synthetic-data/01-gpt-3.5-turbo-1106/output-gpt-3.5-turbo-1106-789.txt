prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: L-type voltage-gated calcium channels. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The L-type voltage-gated calcium channels have been the subject of extensive research due to their crucial role in mediating calcium influx and signaling in excitable cells. These channels are implicated in various physiological processes, including muscle contraction, neurotransmitter release, and gene expression regulation. Dysregulation of L-type voltage-gated calcium channels has been associated with cardiovascular disorders such as cardiac arrhythmias and hypertension. Numerous pharmacological agents targeting these channels, such as dihydropyridine and verapamil, have been developed and utilized in the treatment of hypertension and certain cardiac conditions. However, despite significant progress in understanding the structure and function of L-type voltage-gated calcium channels, further investigation is warranted to elucidate their precise role in disease pathogenesis and identify novel therapeutic strategies.
