prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: IscA. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The IscA protein complex has been identified as a critical player in the biogenesis of iron-sulfur clusters, which are essential for the function of many proteins involved in diverse cellular processes. Previous studies have demonstrated that IscA interacts with various partner proteins to regulate iron-sulfur cluster assembly and transfer, contributing to the maintenance of cellular homeostasis. Dysfunction of the IscA complex has been implicated in the pathogenesis of numerous diseases, including neurodegenerative disorders and certain types of cancer. Additionally, the role of IscA in pathogenic microorganisms has drawn attention due to its potential as a target for novel antimicrobial therapies. Understanding the intricate mechanisms underlying the function of the IscA complex is crucial for the development of therapeutic strategies aimed at modulating iron-sulfur cluster metabolism and mitigating the impact of related diseases.
