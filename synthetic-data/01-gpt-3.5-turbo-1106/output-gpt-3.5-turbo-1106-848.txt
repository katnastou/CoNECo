prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: MetNI transporter. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The MetNI transporter is a crucial component for the uptake of methionine in bacteria. Recent studies have shown that the MetNI transporter in Escherichia coli plays a pivotal role in the metabolism of methionine, a sulfur-containing amino acid essential for cell growth and protein synthesis. Dysfunction of the MetNI transporter has been linked to increased susceptibility to methionine starvation and subsequent cellular stress. Additionally, the MetNI transporter has been implicated in the virulence of certain pathogenic bacteria, highlighting its potential as a target for novel antimicrobial therapies. Understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying the MetNI transporter's function and regulation holds promise for the development of new strategies to combat bacterial infections and improve human health.
