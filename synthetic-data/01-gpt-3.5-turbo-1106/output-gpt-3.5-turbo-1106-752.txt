prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: M-Ficolins. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we examined the role of the M-Ficolins complex in the pathogenesis of influenza infection. We investigated the interaction between M-Ficolins and influenza virus particles, and found that M-Ficolins directly bound to the viral envelope glycoproteins, inhibiting viral entry into host cells. Our findings highlight the potential of M-Ficolins as a key factor in the innate immune response to influenza infection. Furthermore, our results suggest that modulation of M-Ficolins activity may present a novel therapeutic strategy for controlling influenza virus propagation and associated disease severity. This study sheds light on the importance of M-Ficolins in the host defense against influenza and provides new insights into the development of targeted antiviral therapies.
