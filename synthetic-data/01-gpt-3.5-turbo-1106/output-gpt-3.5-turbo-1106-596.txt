prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: fetal hemoglobin HbF. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The expression of fetal hemoglobin HbF has been of great interest in the context of treating sickle cell disease, as increased levels of HbF have been associated with milder clinical manifestations. Various pharmacological approaches have been pursued to induce HbF expression, including the use of hydroxyurea, a well-established therapy for sickle cell disease. Recent studies have highlighted the role of DNA methylation changes in the regulation of HbF expression, particularly targeting the promoters of the Î³-globin genes. Additionally, the identification of genetic modifiers that influence HbF levels has provided insights into the complex regulatory network governing HbF expression. Understanding the mechanisms underlying the switch from fetal to adult hemoglobin production may yield novel therapeutic strategies for the treatment of sickle cell disease.
