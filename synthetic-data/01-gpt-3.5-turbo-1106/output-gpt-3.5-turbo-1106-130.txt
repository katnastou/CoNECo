prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: DNA-directed RNA polymerase. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The transcription process in eukaryotic cells is crucial for gene expression and regulation. The DNA-directed RNA polymerase is a key enzyme responsible for the synthesis of RNA from a DNA template. Dysregulation of DNA-directed RNA polymerase activity has been implicated in various human diseases, including cancer and neurological disorders. Understanding the mechanisms governing the function and regulation of this protein complex is of great interest in biomedical research. Recent studies have identified small molecule inhibitors that target and modulate the activity of DNA-directed RNA polymerase, offering potential therapeutic strategies for the treatment of diseases associated with aberrant transcriptional activity. Further investigation into the structure and function of DNA-directed RNA polymerase is necessary to gain insights into its role in disease pathogenesis and to develop novel therapeutic interventions.
