prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: Galactitol-specific enzyme II. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: Our study aimed to investigate the role of the Galactitol-specific enzyme II (GSEII) protein complex in the pathogenesis of diabetic retinopathy. We conducted proteomic analysis of vitreous samples from diabetic patients with and without retinopathy, along with non-diabetic controls. Our findings revealed differential expression of GSEII in the vitreous of diabetic patients with retinopathy compared to those without retinopathy and non-diabetic controls. We also identified interactions between GSEII and proteins involved in oxidative stress and inflammation. Furthermore, pharmacological inhibition of GSEII in an in vitro model of diabetic retinopathy resulted in decreased production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and reactive oxygen species. These results suggest that GSEII may play a critical role in the pathogenesis of diabetic retinopathy through its involvement in oxidative stress and inflammation. Further studies investigating the potential of GSEII as a therapeutic target for diabetic retinopathy are warranted.
