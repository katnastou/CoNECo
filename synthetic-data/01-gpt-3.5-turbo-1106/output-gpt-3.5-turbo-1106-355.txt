prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: protein kinase. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we investigated the role of the protein kinase complex in the development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in a murine model. Our results demonstrated a significant upregulation of protein kinase activity in HCC tumor tissues compared to non-tumor liver tissues. Furthermore, pharmacological inhibition of protein kinase led to a notable reduction in tumor growth and metastasis in vivo. We also observed a correlation between protein kinase expression and the activation of the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway in HCC. These findings suggest that targeting the protein kinase complex may provide a promising therapeutic strategy for the treatment of HCC.
