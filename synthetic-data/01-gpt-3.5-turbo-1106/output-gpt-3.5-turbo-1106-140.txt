prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: eukaryotic ORC. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The eukaryotic Origin Recognition Complex (ORC) is an essential protein complex involved in DNA replication initiation in eukaryotic cells. Dysfunction of the ORC has been associated with several human genetic disorders, including Meier-Gorlin syndrome and Schizosaccharomyces pombe orc mutants. Further research into the structure and function of eukaryotic ORC may provide valuable insights into the molecular basis of these diseases and potential therapeutic targets. Additionally, the identification of small molecule inhibitors targeting the ORC could have important implications for cancer therapy. This study aims to investigate the role of eukaryotic ORC in DNA replication and explore its potential as a target for therapeutic intervention.
