prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: gamma-delta T cell receptor. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The gamma-delta T cell receptor (γδ TCR) is an essential component of the immune system, playing a critical role in the recognition and response to various antigens. Recent studies have shown that the activation of γδ TCR is associated with the regulation of inflammatory responses in autoimmune diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis and psoriasis. Furthermore, the interaction of γδ TCR with specific ligands, such as phosphoantigens, has been implicated in anti-tumor immune surveillance, suggesting its potential in cancer immunotherapy. Given its versatile functions, understanding the signaling pathways and molecular mechanisms of γδ TCR activation is of utmost importance for the development of targeted therapies for immune-related diseases and cancer.
