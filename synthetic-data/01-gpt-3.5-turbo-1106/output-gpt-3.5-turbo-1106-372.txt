prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: outer dynein arms. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The outer dynein arms are crucial components of the motile cilia and flagella found in multiple eukaryotic organisms, including humans. Dysfunction of the outer dynein arms has been associated with primary ciliary dyskinesia, a genetically heterogeneous disorder characterized by impairment of mucociliary clearance and resulting in recurrent respiratory infections and infertility. Recent studies have focused on the structural and functional characterization of the outer dynein arms, shedding light on their role in generating the coordinated beating motion of cilia and flagella. Furthermore, the discovery of potential small molecule modulators targeting the assembly and activity of the outer dynein arms holds promise for the development of novel therapeutic interventions for primary ciliary dyskinesia.
