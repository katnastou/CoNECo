prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: transcription elongation factor. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The transcription elongation factor complex is a crucial mediator of gene expression in eukaryotic cells. Dysregulation of this complex has been linked to various human diseases, including cancer and neurodegenerative disorders. Recent studies have uncovered the role of certain small molecules in modulating the activity of the transcription elongation factor complex, providing potential targets for therapeutic intervention. Furthermore, investigation of the molecular interactions and conformational changes within the transcription elongation factor complex has provided new insights into the mechanisms underlying gene transcription and potential avenues for drug discovery. Understanding the intricate regulatory network involving the transcription elongation factor complex will be essential for the development of novel treatments targeting diseases associated with aberrant gene expression.
