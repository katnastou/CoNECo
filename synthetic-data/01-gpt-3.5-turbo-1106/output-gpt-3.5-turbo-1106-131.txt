prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: DOM-A. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In recent years, there has been growing interest in understanding the role of the DOM-A protein complex in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease. Accumulating evidence has implicated DOM-A in the regulation of amyloid-beta aggregation and tau hyperphosphorylation, key processes underlying the neurodegenerative cascade in Alzheimer's disease. Furthermore, studies have demonstrated that alterations in DOM-A expression levels are associated with synaptic dysfunction and neuronal loss in animal models of Alzheimer's disease. Given the critical role of DOM-A in these disease-relevant pathways, targeting this protein complex has emerged as a promising therapeutic strategy for Alzheimer's disease. However, further investigation is needed to fully elucidate the molecular mechanisms through which DOM-A contributes to disease progression, paving the way for the development of novel interventions aimed at modulating its activity.
