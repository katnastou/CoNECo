prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: embryonic stem cell-specific BAF. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The embryonic stem cell-specific BAF (esBAF) complex has garnered attention in recent years due to its critical role in maintaining pluripotency and regulating gene expression in embryonic stem cells. This multi-subunit chromatin remodeling complex is composed of unique subunits such as Brg1, BAF155, and BAF60a, which play crucial roles in modulating chromatin structure and gene transcription. Dysregulation of esBAF complex has been implicated in various developmental disorders and cancers, highlighting its significance in both normal development and disease pathology. Furthermore, recent studies have revealed the potential therapeutic implications of targeting the esBAF complex in certain disease states. Further investigation into the precise mechanisms underlying esBAF complex function and regulation is warranted to fully comprehend its biological impact and potential as a therapeutic target.
