prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: phenylalanine-tRNA ligases. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we investigate the role of phenylalanine-tRNA ligases in the development of phenylketonuria, a metabolic disorder caused by a deficiency in the enzyme phenylalanine hydroxylase. Our findings reveal a potential link between impaired phenylalanine-tRNA ligase activity and the accumulation of phenylalanine in individuals with phenylketonuria. Using a murine model, we demonstrate that targeted modulation of phenylalanine-tRNA ligase expression leads to significant alterations in phenylalanine metabolism, providing valuable insights into the pathophysiology of this condition. Our results suggest that phenylalanine-tRNA ligases may represent a promising therapeutic target for the management of phenylketonuria and other related disorders. The molecular mechanisms underlying the observed phenylalanine-tRNA ligase-mediated effects warrant further investigation to elucidate their potential implications for clinical interventions.
