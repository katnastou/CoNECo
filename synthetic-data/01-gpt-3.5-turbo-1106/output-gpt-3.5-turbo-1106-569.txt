prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: PUMA-BCL-2. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: A significant interaction in the regulation of apoptosis involves the PUMA-BCL-2 protein complex, which has been implicated in various cancer types and is an emerging target for therapeutic intervention. PUMA-BCL-2 complexes have been observed to play crucial roles in determining the fate of cells undergoing programmed cell death, and dysregulation of this complex is associated with resistance to chemotherapy in multiple malignancies, including breast and lung cancer. The delicate balance between the pro-apoptotic PUMA and the anti-apoptotic BCL-2 proteins is critical in modulating the intrinsic apoptotic pathway. Further investigations into the mechanistic details of this complex may provide valuable insights into potential strategies for cancer treatment and may open new avenues in drug development.
