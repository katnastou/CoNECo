prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: Nitrate-inducible formate dehydrogenase. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: Nitrate-inducible formate dehydrogenase is a crucial enzyme complex involved in the metabolism of nitrate and formate in various organisms, including bacteria and archaea. Recent studies have shown that the regulatory mechanisms governing the expression and activity of nitrate-inducible formate dehydrogenase are essential for the adaptation of these organisms to changing environmental conditions. The complex has been implicated in the pathogenesis of certain respiratory diseases, as well as in the bioremediation of nitrate-contaminated environments. Understanding the intricate molecular interactions and physiological roles of nitrate-inducible formate dehydrogenase has the potential to shed light on innovative strategies for combating nitrate-related environmental and health challenges.
