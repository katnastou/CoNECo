prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: U3 small nucleolar RNA-associated protein. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The U3 small nucleolar RNA-associated protein (U3 snoRNP) is a multifunctional ribonucleoprotein complex involved in the biogenesis and processing of ribosomal RNA. Several studies have demonstrated its essential role in the maturation of the small subunit (SSU) of the ribosome. Dysregulation or mutations of U3 snoRNP have been implicated in a variety of human diseases, including various types of cancer and ribosomopathies. Furthermore, the dynamic interactions between U3 snoRNP and the pre-ribosomal RNA molecules are crucial for the proper assembly and processing of ribosomal subunits. Understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying the function of U3 snoRNP is of paramount importance for the development of targeted therapies for diseases associated with ribosome biogenesis defects.
