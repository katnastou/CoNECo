prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2B. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we investigated the role of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2B (eIF2B) in the development of Alzheimer's disease. We utilized a transgenic mouse model overexpressing mutant amyloid precursor protein to examine the impact of eIF2B dysregulation on the progression of Alzheimer's pathology. Our results demonstrated a significant upregulation of eIF2B activity in the hippocampus of the transgenic mice, which correlated with increased levels of amyloid-Î² plaques and neurofibrillary tangles, hallmark features of Alzheimer's disease. Furthermore, we observed a dysregulated phosphorylation status of eIF2B in the brains of these mice, suggesting a potential link between eIF2B-mediated translational control and Alzheimer's-associated neurodegeneration. These findings highlight the potential of targeting eIF2B as a therapeutic strategy for combating Alzheimer's disease progression.
