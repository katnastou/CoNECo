prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: Polymerase-zeta. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we investigated the role of the Polymerase-zeta protein complex in the context of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) development and progression. We found that the expression levels of Polymerase-zeta were significantly upregulated in NSCLC tumor tissues compared to adjacent normal lung tissues. Furthermore, we observed a positive correlation between Polymerase-zeta expression and tumor grade and stage. Importantly, our results also revealed that high expression of Polymerase-zeta was associated with poorer overall survival in NSCLC patients. These findings suggest that Polymerase-zeta may play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of NSCLC and could serve as a potential prognostic biomarker and therapeutic target for this aggressive malignancy. Further investigations into the functional mechanisms of Polymerase-zeta in NSCLC are warranted to better understand its contribution to tumor progression and to develop targeted treatment strategies.
