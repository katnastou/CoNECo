prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: plasma membrane signaling receptors. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we investigated the role of plasma membrane signaling receptors in the pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis. We utilized a murine model of collagen-induced arthritis to assess the impact of modulating the activity of these receptors on disease progression. Our results demonstrated that targeting the plasma membrane signaling receptors with a novel small molecule inhibitor led to a significant reduction in joint inflammation and bone erosion. Furthermore, we observed a concomitant decrease in the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines within the synovial fluid of treated animals. These findings suggest that the plasma membrane signaling receptors may represent a promising therapeutic target for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis.
