prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: UvrBC. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The role of the UvrBC complex in nucleotide excision repair has been a subject of intensive investigation in the field of molecular biology. This complex, consisting of the UvrB and UvrC proteins, is crucial for the recognition and removal of DNA lesions induced by various environmental factors, such as UV radiation. Recent studies have highlighted the interplay between the UvrBC complex and the p53 tumor suppressor protein in the context of DNA damage response. Furthermore, the dysregulation of UvrBC-mediated repair processes has been implicated in the pathogenesis of skin cancers, indicating its potential as a therapeutic target for the treatment of UV-induced malignancies. Further elucidation of the molecular mechanisms underlying the function of the UvrBC complex promises to deepen our understanding of DNA repair pathways and facilitate the development of novel strategies for combating UV-related diseases.
