prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: glutamic acid dehydrogenase. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: Glutamic acid dehydrogenase (GAD) is an important enzyme involved in the catalysis of the oxidative deamination of L-glutamate to Î±-ketoglutarate, a key step in glutamate metabolism. Dysregulation of GAD has been implicated in various neurological conditions, such as epilepsy and neurodegenerative disorders. Recent studies have highlighted the potential role of GAD in the pathogenesis of metabolic diseases, including diabetes and obesity. The allosteric regulation and kinetic properties of GAD continue to be areas of interest for researchers aiming to understand its physiological and pathological implications. Moreover, the identification of novel small molecule modulators of GAD activity holds promise for the development of therapeutic interventions targeting these disease states.
