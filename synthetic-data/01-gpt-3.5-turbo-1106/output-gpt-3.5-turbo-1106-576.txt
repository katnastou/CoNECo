prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: GDP-forming succinyl-CoA synthetase. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In recent years, there has been an increasing interest in the role of the GDP-forming succinyl-CoA synthetase (GDP-SCS) protein complex in various metabolic pathways. Studies have revealed the significance of GDP-SCS in linking the tricarboxylic acid cycle with the synthesis of ATP and the maintenance of redox balance. Furthermore, the dysregulation of GDP-SCS activity has been implicated in several metabolic disorders, including inherited metabolic diseases and cancer. The elucidation of the intricate molecular mechanisms underlying the function of GDP-forming succinyl-CoA synthetase has provided valuable insights into potential therapeutic targets for such conditions. Further investigations into the regulatory pathways governing GDP-SCS activity may open up new avenues for the development of targeted interventions to modulate metabolic processes and ameliorate associated pathological states.
