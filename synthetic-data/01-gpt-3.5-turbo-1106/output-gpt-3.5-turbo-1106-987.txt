prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: SQR. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The SQR protein complex has been implicated in various metabolic pathways and has recently garnered attention for its potential role in oxidative stress. In a study involving rat models, the expression of SQR was found to be significantly upregulated in response to chronic exposure to a high-fat diet. This upregulation correlated with increased levels of reactive oxygen species and lipid peroxidation in the liver, suggesting a possible link between SQR activity and oxidative damage. Furthermore, treatment with an antioxidant compound resulted in reduced levels of SQR expression and attenuated oxidative stress markers, providing evidence of the potential impact of targeting SQR in mitigating oxidative damage associated with high-fat diet-induced metabolic dysfunction. These findings shed light on the potential significance of the SQR protein complex in the context of metabolic disorders and oxidative stress-related pathologies.
