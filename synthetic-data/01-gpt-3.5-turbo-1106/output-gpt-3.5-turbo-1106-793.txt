prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: ammonium transmembrane transporter. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The role of the ammonium transmembrane transporter (ATT) in the regulation of nitrogen metabolism in plants has been a subject of intense research. Recent studies have elucidated the importance of ATT in the uptake and distribution of ammonium ions within plant cells, thus influencing their growth and development. Additionally, the interplay between ATT and key enzymes involved in nitrogen assimilation pathways has been investigated, further highlighting the intricate network of processes governing plant metabolism. Furthermore, the impact of environmental factors, such as nitrogen availability and stress conditions, on the expression and function of ATT has been explored, shedding light on its potential as a target for improving crop tolerance to nitrogen-related abiotic stresses. Collectively, these findings underscore the essential role of ATT in plant nitrogen homeostasis and present promising avenues for further research aimed at enhancing crop productivity and sustainability.
