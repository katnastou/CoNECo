prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: RNA N6-methyladenosine methyltransferase. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The RNA N6-methyladenosine methyltransferase (RNMT) complex is a critical player in the epitranscriptome, contributing to the regulation of RNA methylation and subsequent gene expression. Recent studies have demonstrated the involvement of RNMT in various cellular processes, including mRNA stability, splicing, and translation. Dysregulation of RNMT has been associated with several human diseases, such as cancer and neurodegenerative disorders. Understanding the intricate molecular mechanisms of RNMT in methylating adenosine residues within RNA will advance our knowledge of its role in disease pathogenesis and potentially reveal novel therapeutic targets for intervention. The analysis of the RNMT complex provides an exciting avenue for future research aiming to elucidate its impact on human health and disease.
