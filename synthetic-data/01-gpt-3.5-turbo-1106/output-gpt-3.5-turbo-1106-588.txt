prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: HDL. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In recent years, there has been growing interest in the role of the high-density lipoprotein (HDL) complex in cardiovascular health. Elevated HDL levels have long been associated with a reduced risk of coronary heart disease, leading to the widespread belief that HDL acts as a "good" cholesterol. However, recent research has unveiled a more complex relationship between HDL levels and cardiovascular outcomes. Studies have shown that the functional properties of HDL, such as its ability to promote cholesterol efflux from peripheral tissues, may be more important than absolute HDL levels in predicting cardiovascular risk. Furthermore, the heterogeneity of HDL particles and their diverse lipid and protein composition have been implicated in modulating the overall functionality of HDL. These findings highlight the importance of understanding the nuanced roles of HDL in cardiometabolic diseases and may have implications for the development of novel therapeutic strategies targeting HDL functionality rather than simply raising HDL levels.
