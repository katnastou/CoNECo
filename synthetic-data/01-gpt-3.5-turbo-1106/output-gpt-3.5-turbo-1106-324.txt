prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: mitochondrial outer membrane translocases. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The mitochondrial outer membrane translocases are vital in the import of precursor proteins into the mitochondria, facilitating their integration into the mitochondrial outer membrane and subsequent transport into the intermembrane space or inner membrane. Dysfunction of these translocases has been associated with various mitochondrial disorders, including Leigh syndrome, and has been implicated in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's. Recent studies have demonstrated the potential therapeutic efficacy of small molecule modulators targeting the activity of the mitochondrial outer membrane translocases in restoring mitochondrial function and ameliorating disease phenotypes. Further investigation into the regulatory mechanisms and protein-protein interactions of the mitochondrial outer membrane translocases is critical for developing targeted interventions for mitochondrial dysfunction-related disorders.
