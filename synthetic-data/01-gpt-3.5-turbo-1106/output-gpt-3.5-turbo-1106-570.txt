prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: cytoplasmic dynein heavy chain. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: Intracellular transport is crucial for maintaining the spatial organization and function of eukaryotic cells. Cytoplasmic dynein heavy chain, a key component of the cytoplasmic dynein motor complex, plays a vital role in the retrograde transport of various cargoes along microtubules. Dysregulation of cytoplasmic dynein heavy chain has been implicated in neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's, where disrupted intracellular transport contributes to neuronal dysfunction and pathology. Recent studies have demonstrated the involvement of cytoplasmic dynein heavy chain in the transport of signaling molecules vital for cell growth and differentiation, highlighting its significance in developmental processes. Given its essential role in intracellular transport, the cytoplasmic dynein motor complex, including the dynein heavy chain, represents an attractive therapeutic target for diseases characterized by impaired intracellular transport mechanisms. Understanding the regulation and function of cytoplasmic dynein heavy chain will provide valuable insights into the pathogenesis of various diseases and may lead to the development of novel therapeutic interventions aimed at restoring intracellular transport dynamics.
