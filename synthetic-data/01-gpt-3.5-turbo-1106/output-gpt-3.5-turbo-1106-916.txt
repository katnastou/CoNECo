prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: AMY2. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: Preliminary studies have suggested an association between the AMY2 protein complex and the risk of type 2 diabetes. This association has sparked interest in elucidating the role of AMY2 in glucose metabolism and insulin signaling pathways. To investigate this, we conducted a series of in vitro experiments using pancreatic beta cells derived from healthy human donors and individuals with type 2 diabetes. Our findings revealed a significant downregulation of AMY2 expression in diabetic beta cells, which correlated with impaired insulin secretion and diminished glucose uptake. Furthermore, we observed a dysregulation of key glycolytic enzymes in cells with decreased AMY2 levels, suggesting a potential link between AMY2 and altered glucose homeostasis. These results contribute to our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying type 2 diabetes and highlight AMY2 as a potential therapeutic target for the management of this prevalent metabolic disorder.
