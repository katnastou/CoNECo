prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: laminins. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: Laminins are a family of large, multidomain glycoproteins that play a crucial role in the formation and maintenance of the extracellular matrix (ECM). This ECM network provides structural support and biochemical cues to surrounding cells, influencing various cellular processes including adhesion, migration, and differentiation. Laminins are distributed widely throughout the basement membranes of various tissues, where they interact with integrins, dystroglycan, and other ECM molecules. Aberrant expression or mutations in laminin genes have been associated with various human diseases, such as muscular dystrophy, kidney diseases, and cancer, highlighting the diverse and essential functions of laminins in physiological and pathological conditions. Understanding the complex biology and mechanisms of laminins holds great promise for developing novel therapeutic strategies targeting these molecules in diverse disease states.
