prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: UvrABC excinuclease. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In recent studies, the UvrABC excinuclease has been shown to play a crucial role in the repair of DNA damage caused by UV radiation. This complex, consisting of UvrA, UvrB, and UvrC subunits, operates as an endonuclease that is involved in the recognition and excision of damaged DNA sections. The UvrABC excinuclease has been found to be particularly important in the prevention of mutagenesis and the development of skin cancer, as it enables the repair of UV-induced DNA lesions. Understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying the function of the UvrABC excinuclease may provide important insights for the development of targeted therapies for UV-induced DNA damage-related diseases.
