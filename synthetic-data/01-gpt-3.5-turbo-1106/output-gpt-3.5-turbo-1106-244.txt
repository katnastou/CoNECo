prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: GABA transaminase. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we investigated the role of the GABA transaminase protein complex in the pathogenesis of Huntington's disease. Our results revealed a significant upregulation of GABA transaminase levels in the striatum of Huntington's disease patients compared to healthy controls. Furthermore, we identified a direct correlation between GABA transaminase expression and the severity of motor symptoms in Huntington's disease. Pharmacological inhibition of GABA transaminase activity resulted in a reduction of neurotoxicity and improved motor function in a mouse model of Huntington's disease. These findings suggest that targeting the GABA transaminase complex may hold promise as a therapeutic approach for mitigating the progression of Huntington's disease.
