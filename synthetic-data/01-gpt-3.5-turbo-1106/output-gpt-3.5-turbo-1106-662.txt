prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: O-GlcNAc transferase. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In recent years, the O-GlcNAc transferase protein complex has been the focus of intensive research due to its crucial role in post-translational modification. O-GlcNAc transferase, a key enzyme responsible for the addition of O-linked N-acetylglucosamine to serine and threonine residues of nuclear and cytoplasmic proteins, plays a significant role in several biological processes. Aberrant O-GlcNAc transferase activity has been implicated in the pathogenesis of various diseases, including diabetes, cancer, and neurodegenerative disorders. Given its importance in cellular signaling and metabolism, targeting O-GlcNAc transferase has emerged as a promising therapeutic strategy for the treatment of these diseases. Further investigation into the regulatory mechanisms and functional roles of O-GlcNAc transferase will likely uncover new avenues for the development of targeted interventions.
