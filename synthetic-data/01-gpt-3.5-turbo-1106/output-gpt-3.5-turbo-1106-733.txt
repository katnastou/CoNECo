prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: methionine adenosyltransferase. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: Methionine adenosyltransferase (MAT) is a key enzyme involved in the biosynthesis of S-adenosylmethionine (SAM), a crucial methyl donor in various cellular processes. Dysregulation of MAT has been implicated in several human diseases, including liver cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma, and methionine adenosyltransferase deficiency. Furthermore, SAM has been shown to play a protective role in neurodegenerative disorders, making MAT an attractive target for therapeutic intervention. The intricate interplay between MAT activity, SAM levels, and disease pathogenesis underscores the importance of understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying MAT regulation. In this study, we aim to elucidate the structural and functional properties of MAT and its interactions with regulatory factors, in order to provide insights into potential avenues for the development of targeted therapies.
