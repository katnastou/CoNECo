prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: Flagellar export. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The Flagellar export protein complex plays a crucial role in the motility of various bacterial species, including Escherichia coli and Salmonella enterica. The assembly of the flagellar filament is a complex process involving the export of flagellar subunits from the cytoplasm to the growing flagellar structure. Recent studies have demonstrated that the Flagellar export complex interacts with specific chaperone proteins to facilitate the transportation of flagellar subunits across the cytoplasmic membrane. Dysregulation of this complex has been associated with impaired motility in bacterial pathogens, leading to potential implications in infectious diseases and host-pathogen interactions. Understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying the function of the Flagellar export complex may provide insights into novel therapeutic strategies targeting bacterial motility and pathogenesis.
