prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: LMA1. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The LMA1 protein complex has emerged as a critical regulator in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease. Recent studies have shown that LMA1 interacts with beta-amyloid peptides, leading to the formation of neurotoxic aggregates associated with disease progression. Furthermore, LMA1 has been implicated in modulating the activity of presenilin, a key component of the gamma-secretase complex responsible for cleaving amyloid precursor protein (APP) into amyloid-beta peptides. The dysregulation of LMA1 levels has been observed in post-mortem brain tissues from Alzheimer's disease patients, suggesting its potential as a diagnostic and therapeutic target. These findings underscore the significance of the LMA1 protein complex in Alzheimer's disease pathophysiology and highlight its potential as a novel therapeutic intervention point.
