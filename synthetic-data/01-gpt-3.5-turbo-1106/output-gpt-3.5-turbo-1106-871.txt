prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: GET. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: Our study investigates the role of the GET protein complex in the context of cellular protein trafficking and homeostasis. The GET complex has been implicated in the transport of tail-anchored proteins to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane, a crucial process for maintaining protein quality control within the cell. Through a series of biochemical and genetic experiments, we demonstrate that the disruption of GET complex function leads to ER stress and compromised cell viability. Furthermore, we uncover a potential link between aberrant GET complex activity and the onset of neurodegenerative disorders such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and Parkinson's disease. Our findings highlight the significance of the GET complex in maintaining cellular proteostasis and provide insights into its potential implications for human health and disease.
