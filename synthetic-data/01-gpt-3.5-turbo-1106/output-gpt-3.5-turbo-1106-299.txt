prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: enhanceosome. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The enhanceosome is a well-studied multi-subunit protein complex that is pivotal in regulating the transcription of genes related to immune responses. Recent studies have shown that the enhanceosome plays a crucial role in the activation of interleukin-2, a key cytokine involved in T cell proliferation and differentiation. Furthermore, dysregulation of the enhanceosome has been implicated in several autoimmune diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis and lupus. Understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying the assembly and function of the enhanceosome holds promise for the development of targeted therapeutics for these debilitating conditions. Through the identification of small molecule modulators that can selectively disrupt enhanceosome activity, there is potential for the development of novel treatments aimed at restoring immune homeostasis in autoimmune disorders.
