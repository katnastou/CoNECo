prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: cardiac PLB. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we investigated the role of the cardiac PLB protein complex in the pathogenesis of heart failure. Our findings revealed a significant downregulation of cardiac PLB expression in patients with dilated cardiomyopathy. Furthermore, we observed a strong correlation between reduced cardiac PLB levels and impaired calcium handling in cardiomyocytes from these patients. Through experimental manipulation of cardiac PLB levels in an animal model, we demonstrated a direct link between decreased expression of this protein complex and the development of ventricular arrhythmias. These results suggest that dysregulation of cardiac PLB may play a pivotal role in the progression of heart failure and could serve as a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of this debilitating condition.
