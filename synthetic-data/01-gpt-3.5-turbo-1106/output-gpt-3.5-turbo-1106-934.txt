prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: RNA-directed RNA polymerase. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The RNA-directed RNA polymerase (RdRP) is a crucial enzyme involved in the replication and transcription of RNA viruses. Recent studies have highlighted the role of RdRP in the pathogenesis of various viral infections, including influenza, Ebola, and SARS-CoV-2. Understanding the mechanisms underlying the activity of RdRP is essential for the development of antiviral therapies targeting this enzyme. Additionally, the interaction of RdRP with viral genomes and host cell machinery further emphasizes its significance as a potential target for drug development. A deeper comprehension of the structural and functional properties of RdRP will pave the way for the design of novel therapeutic strategies to combat viral infections.
