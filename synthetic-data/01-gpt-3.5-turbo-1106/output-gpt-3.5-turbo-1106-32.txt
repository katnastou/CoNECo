prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: carbamoyl-phosphate synthase. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we investigated the role of carbamoyl-phosphate synthase in the development of urea cycle disorders. We examined the expression levels of this protein complex in liver tissue samples from patients with various urea cycle disorders, including ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency and citrullinemia. Our findings suggest a potential correlation between reduced carbamoyl-phosphate synthase activity and the severity of urea cycle disorders. Additionally, we observed alterations in the levels of related metabolites, such as citrulline and argininosuccinate, in these patients, indicating a potential link between carbamoyl-phosphate synthase dysfunction and disrupted urea cycle metabolism. These results highlight the importance of further exploring the molecular mechanisms underlying carbamoyl-phosphate synthase deficiency in the context of urea cycle disorders.
