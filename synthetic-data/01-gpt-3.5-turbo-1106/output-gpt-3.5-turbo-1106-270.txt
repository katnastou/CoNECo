prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: inner kinetochore. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The inner kinetochore is a key molecular complex involved in the assembly and regulation of the macromolecular structure responsible for linking centromeric DNA to spindle microtubules during mitosis and meiosis. This intricate multi-subunit protein assembly has been the focus of extensive studies in various model organisms, including yeast, flies, and vertebrates, due to its crucial role in ensuring accurate chromosome segregation. Dysregulation or malfunction of the inner kinetochore has been implicated in a range of human diseases, including various cancers and developmental disorders. Efforts to elucidate the molecular mechanisms governing inner kinetochore function have provided important insights into the fundamental processes underpinning cell division and have the potential to inform the development of novel therapeutic strategies targeting aberrant mitotic processes.
