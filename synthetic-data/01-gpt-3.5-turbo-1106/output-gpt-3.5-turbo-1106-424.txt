prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: CTDK-I. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: A recent study investigated the role of the CTDK-I protein complex in breast cancer progression. The researchers utilized a combination of in vitro and in vivo approaches to elucidate the impact of CTDK-I on tumor growth and metastasis. The results revealed that inhibition of CTDK-I activity significantly suppressed the proliferation and invasion of breast cancer cells. In addition, analysis of patient tumor samples demonstrated a positive correlation between CTDK-I expression levels and disease severity. These findings highlight the potential utility of targeting CTDK-I as a therapeutic strategy for managing advanced breast cancer. Further investigation into the molecular mechanisms underlying CTDK-I function is warranted to fully comprehend its role in tumorigenesis and metastatic dissemination.
