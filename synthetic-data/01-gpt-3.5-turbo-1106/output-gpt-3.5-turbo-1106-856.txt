prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: transforming growth factor betas. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In recent years, the role of transforming growth factor betas (TGF-βs) in the pathogenesis of various diseases has gained increasing attention. TGF-βs are multifunctional cytokines that play a critical role in the regulation of cell growth, differentiation, and immune response. Dysregulation of TGF-β signaling has been implicated in various pathological conditions, including cancer, fibrosis, and autoimmune disorders. The intricate interplay between TGF-βs and other signaling pathways, as well as their crosstalk with environmental and genetic factors, has highlighted the complexity of their role in disease progression. Elucidating the precise mechanisms underlying TGF-β signaling and its impact on disease etiology holds great promise for the development of targeted therapies aimed at modulating TGF-β activity and improving patient outcomes.
