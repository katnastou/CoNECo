prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: ESCRT. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The endosomal sorting complex required for transport (ESCRT) is a crucial protein complex involved in the intracellular trafficking and degradation of membrane proteins. Its dysfunction has been linked to the pathogenesis of various diseases, including neurodegenerative disorders and viral infections. In particular, ESCRT has been implicated in the regulation of viral budding and release, highlighting its potential as a target for antiviral therapy. Additionally, studies have demonstrated the involvement of ESCRT in the formation of multivesicular bodies, which play a pivotal role in the downstream processes of endocytosis and autophagy. The intricate interplay between ESCRT and various cellular processes underscores the significance of understanding its molecular mechanisms and regulation in order to develop targeted interventions for diseases associated with its dysregulation.
