prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: efflux pumps. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: Efflux pumps play a crucial role in multidrug resistance in bacterial pathogens, facilitating the expulsion of a wide range of compounds, including antibiotics, from the bacterial cell. This phenomenon poses a significant challenge in the treatment of infectious diseases, as it limits the effectiveness of commonly used antibiotics. Efflux pumps are implicated in the development of resistance to multiple classes of antibiotics, leading to persistent infections and increased morbidity. Efforts to combat this resistance mechanism have focused on the development of efflux pump inhibitors that can restore the efficacy of antibiotics against resistant bacterial strains. Targeting efflux pumps presents an innovative strategy for addressing antibiotic resistance and improving the clinical management of infectious diseases.
