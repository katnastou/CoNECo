prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: soluble guanylate cyclase. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we investigated the role of the soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC) in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular diseases. Our results demonstrated that sGC is a critical mediator of nitric oxide (NO) signaling in vascular smooth muscle cells, and its dysregulation contributes to endothelial dysfunction and hypertension. Furthermore, we observed that pharmacological activation of sGC with NO donors or sGC stimulators attenuated vascular tone and improved endothelial function in hypertensive animal models. These findings highlight the potential therapeutic value of targeting sGC for the treatment of cardiovascular disorders and provide insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying sGC-mediated vasodilation and blood pressure regulation.
