prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: histone deacetylase. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In recent years, the role of histone deacetylase (HDAC) has attracted significant attention in the field of cancer research. Studies have indicated that HDAC is involved in the regulation of gene expression through the deacetylation of histones, leading to alterations in chromatin structure and ultimately impacting cellular processes. Dysregulation of HDAC activity has been implicated in various cancers, such as leukemia, breast cancer, and colorectal cancer. Furthermore, the potential therapeutic value of HDAC inhibitors in cancer treatment has been a topic of intense investigation. Therefore, understanding the mechanistic role of HDAC in cancer progression and the development of effective HDAC-targeted therapies holds great promise for the future of cancer treatment.
