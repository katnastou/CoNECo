prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: CAF-1. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The CAF-1 protein complex has been implicated in the regulation of chromatin assembly and DNA repair processes. Recent studies have shown that CAF-1 plays a crucial role in maintaining genomic stability, and its dysregulation has been associated with increased susceptibility to DNA damage and impaired DNA replication. Furthermore, CAF-1 has been linked to various human diseases, including cancer and developmental disorders. Understanding the molecular mechanisms governing the function of the CAF-1 complex may provide valuable insights into the etiology of these diseases and facilitate the development of novel therapeutic strategies. Moreover, targeting CAF-1 could represent a promising approach for preventing genomic instability and combating diseases associated with defective DNA repair mechanisms.
