prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: delta DNA polymerase. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In recent years, the role of the delta DNA polymerase protein complex in tumorigenesis has gained attention due to its association with various types of cancer. Studies have revealed that aberrant expression of delta DNA polymerase is linked to increased genomic instability and somatic mutations, which are key factors in the development and progression of cancer. Furthermore, dysregulation of this protein complex has been implicated in the resistance to chemotherapeutic agents in a subset of cancer patients. As a promising target for novel therapeutic strategies, further research into the molecular mechanisms underlying the function and regulation of delta DNA polymerase is essential for the development of effective interventions for cancer management.
