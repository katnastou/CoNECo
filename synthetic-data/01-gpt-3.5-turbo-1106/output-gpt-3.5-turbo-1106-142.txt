prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: matrilin-3. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we aimed to investigate the interaction between matrilin-3 and aggrecan in the context of osteoarthritis. We utilized cartilage samples from patients with osteoarthritis and characterized the expression patterns of matrilin-3 and aggrecan using immunohistochemistry and Western blot analysis. Our results demonstrated a significant increase in the expression of matrilin-3 in diseased cartilage compared to healthy controls, while the expression of aggrecan remained unchanged. Furthermore, we observed a co-localization of matrilin-3 and aggrecan in the extracellular matrix, suggesting a potential functional relationship between these two molecules in the pathogenesis of osteoarthritis. These findings provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying osteoarthritis and may offer potential targets for therapeutic interventions aimed at modulating matrilin-3 and aggrecan interactions.
