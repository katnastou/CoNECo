prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: T6SS. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The Type VI Secretion System (T6SS) is a highly conserved protein complex found in a wide range of Gram-negative bacteria. The T6SS is known to play a crucial role in the pathogenesis and virulence of various bacterial species, including the human pathogens Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii. Recent studies have revealed that the T6SS is involved in interbacterial competition and host-pathogen interactions, making it a promising target for the development of novel antimicrobial strategies. Furthermore, dysregulation of the T6SS has been implicated in the progression of infectious diseases, such as urinary tract infections and sepsis. Understanding the mechanisms underlying T6SS function and regulation may offer new insights into the development of targeted therapies for combating bacterial infections.
