prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: KPC. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE) infections have presented a significant public health challenge, particularly due to the emergence of β-lactamase-producing Enterobacteriaceae strains. Among these, the Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase (KPC) producing strains have become a major concern, as they confer resistance to almost all β-lactam antibiotics. The dissemination of KPC-producing strains has resulted in outbreaks of infections worldwide. Given the limited treatment options for such infections, there is an urgent need to develop new strategies to combat KPC-producing Enterobacteriaceae, including the exploration of novel antimicrobial agents and the development of effective infection control measures.
