prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: pyruvate dehydrogenase. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The pyruvate dehydrogenase complex is a crucial enzyme complex in the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, playing a vital role in the conversion of pyruvate to acetyl-CoA. Dysregulation of this complex has been implicated in a variety of diseases, including metabolic disorders and certain types of cancer. Understanding the regulation and function of the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex is therefore of great importance in elucidating the underlying mechanisms of these diseases. Recent studies have shed light on the various post-translational modifications and regulatory factors that modulate the activity of the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex, providing potential targets for therapeutic intervention. Further research is warranted to fully elucidate the implications of pyruvate dehydrogenase complex dysregulation in disease pathology and identify novel strategies for therapeutic intervention.
