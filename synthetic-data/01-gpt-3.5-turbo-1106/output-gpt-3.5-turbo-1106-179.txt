prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: DGC. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The dystrophin-glycoprotein complex (DGC) is a critical component of the sarcolemma, facilitating muscle membrane stability and function. Defects in the DGC have been implicated in the pathogenesis of various muscular dystrophies, including Duchenne muscular dystrophy and Becker muscular dystrophy. The DGC is composed of several subunits, including dystrophin, sarcoglycans, dystroglycans, and syntrophins, each playing a distinct role in maintaining the integrity of the muscle fiber. Dysfunction of the DGC can lead to increased susceptibility to muscle damage and degeneration, contributing to the progressive weakness and loss of muscle mass characteristic of these disorders. Understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying DGC dysfunction is crucial for the development of targeted therapies to alleviate the symptoms and progression of muscular dystrophies.
