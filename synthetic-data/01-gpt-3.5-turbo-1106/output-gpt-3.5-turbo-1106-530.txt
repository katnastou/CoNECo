prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: Ribosome-ST. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: A critical aspect in the regulation of protein synthesis is the involvement of the Ribosome-ST complex. Recent studies have highlighted the role of this complex in the translation of mRNA sequences into functional proteins. The complex has been found to interact with specific chemical modifiers that regulate its activity, ultimately affecting the rate and fidelity of protein synthesis. Furthermore, dysregulation of the Ribosome-ST complex has been implicated in various diseases, including cancer and neurodegenerative disorders. Understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying the function and regulation of this complex has the potential to uncover novel therapeutic targets for the treatment of these conditions.
