prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: Flexilin. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In recent studies, the role of the Flexilin protein complex in modulating extracellular matrix (ECM) dynamics and its implications in the pathophysiology of pulmonary fibrosis have gained significant attention. The interaction between Flexilin and ECM glycoproteins, such as fibronectin and laminin, has been shown to contribute to the maintenance of ECM integrity and the regulation of cellular adhesion and migration processes. Dysregulation of Flexilin expression has been linked to aberrant ECM remodeling and the development of fibrotic lesions in diseases such as idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. Further understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying the involvement of Flexilin in ECM homeostasis may provide novel insights for the development of targeted therapeutic strategies for pulmonary fibrosis and related fibrotic disorders.
