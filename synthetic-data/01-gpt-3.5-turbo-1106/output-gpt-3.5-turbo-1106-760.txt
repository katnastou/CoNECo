prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: zona pellucida receptor. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The zona pellucida receptor is a key molecular entity involved in the process of fertilization. This complex plays a critical role in the recognition and binding of the zona pellucida, a glycoprotein matrix surrounding the oocyte. Dysregulation or mutations of the zona pellucida receptor have been associated with infertility and reproductive disorders in various organisms, including humans. Recent studies have identified potential small molecule modulators of the zona pellucida receptor, offering promising avenues for the development of novel contraceptive methods and infertility treatments. Understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying the interactions between the zona pellucida receptor and its ligands holds significant potential for advancing reproductive health research and clinical interventions.
