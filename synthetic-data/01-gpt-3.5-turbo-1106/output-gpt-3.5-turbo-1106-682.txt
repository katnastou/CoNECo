prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: NADH dehydrogenases. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In recent years, there has been growing interest in the role of NADH dehydrogenases in various pathological conditions, including neurodegenerative diseases and cancer. NADH dehydrogenases are key players in the electron transport chain and are essential for the generation of ATP. Studies have shown that dysregulation of NADH dehydrogenase activity is associated with mitochondrial dysfunction, leading to oxidative stress and cell death. Furthermore, NADH dehydrogenases have been linked to the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease and certain types of cancer. Understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying the function of NADH dehydrogenases may offer new insights into the development of therapeutic strategies for these devastating conditions.
