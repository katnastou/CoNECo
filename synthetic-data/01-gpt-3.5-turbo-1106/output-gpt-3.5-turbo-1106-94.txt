prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: hydroxyisourate hydrolases. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: Hydroxyisourate hydrolases (HH) are key enzymes involved in the metabolism of purine nucleotides, catalyzing the hydrolysis of hydroxyisourate to allantoin in a crucial step of the uric acid pathway. Dysregulation of HH activity has been implicated in various metabolic disorders, including hyperuricemia and gout. Recent studies have identified potential small-molecule inhibitors of HH activity, with implications for the treatment of these diseases. Additionally, the genetic variation of HH has been associated with altered predisposition to hyperuricemia in different human populations, highlighting the importance of further research into the functional and clinical significance of HH variations. Understanding the role of HH in uric acid metabolism may provide valuable insights into the pathogenesis and management of hyperuricemia-related conditions.
