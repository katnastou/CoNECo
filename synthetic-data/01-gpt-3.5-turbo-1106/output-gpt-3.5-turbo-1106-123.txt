prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: cardiac PLN. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we aimed to investigate the role of cardiac PLN in the pathogenesis of dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM). Through a series of in vitro experiments using cardiac myocytes isolated from a mouse model of DCM, we observed alterations in the calcium regulatory function of cardiac PLN, leading to impaired myocardial contractility. Furthermore, examination of cardiac tissue samples from patients with DCM revealed aberrant expression patterns of cardiac PLN, suggesting its potential involvement in the progression of DCM. Our findings provide novel insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying DCM and highlight the significance of cardiac PLN as a potential therapeutic target for mitigating the progression of this debilitating cardiac disease.
