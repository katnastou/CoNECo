prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: brahma. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we investigated the role of the brahma complex in regulating gene expression and cellular function in the context of breast cancer. By utilizing a combination of chemical inhibitors and genetic manipulations, we demonstrated that the brahma complex plays a pivotal role in promoting the proliferation and migration of breast cancer cells. Furthermore, we discovered that the overexpression of certain oncogenes led to an upregulation of brahma complex activity, thereby exacerbating the malignancy of breast cancer. Our findings highlight the potential significance of targeting the brahma complex as a novel therapeutic strategy for combating aggressive forms of breast cancer. This research provides valuable insights into the intricate molecular mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis of breast cancer and offers promise for the development of targeted interventions aimed at disrupting the oncogenic activity of the brahma complex.
