prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: laminin. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: Previous studies have suggested that laminin, a key extracellular matrix protein, plays a significant role in cellular adhesion, migration, and differentiation. In the context of cancer, dysregulation of laminin has been implicated in tumor invasion and metastasis. Here, we aimed to elucidate the role of laminin in the progression of breast cancer. Using a murine model, we demonstrated that perturbation of laminin expression led to accelerated tumor growth and increased angiogenesis. Furthermore, we observed a correlation between laminin levels and the expression of matrix metalloproteinases, suggesting a potential mechanism for laminin-mediated tumor progression. These findings contribute to our understanding of the intricate interplay between extracellular matrix components and cancer progression, and may pave the way for novel therapeutic strategies targeting laminin in breast cancer.
