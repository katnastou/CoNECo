prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: N5-methyltetrahydromethanopterin-coenzyme M methyltransferase. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: Utilizing an in vitro assay system, the activity of N5-methyltetrahydromethanopterin-coenzyme M methyltransferase was investigated in the context of methanogenesis in methane-producing archaea. The impact of varying concentrations of coenzyme M and N5-methyltetrahydromethanopterin on the catalytic activity of the enzyme complex was assessed. Additionally, the effects of temperature and pH on the enzyme's functionality were examined. The findings indicate that N5-methyltetrahydromethanopterin-coenzyme M methyltransferase exhibits optimal activity at neutral pH and moderate temperatures, with significant differences in activity observed at varying coenzyme M and N5-methyltetrahydromethanopterin concentrations. This investigation provides insight into the enzymatic properties of N5-methyltetrahydromethanopterin-coenzyme M methyltransferase and its implications in the methanogenic pathways of archaea.
