prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: PhnCDE. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The role of the PhnCDE protein complex in the pathogenesis of osteosarcoma has been a topic of increasing interest in recent years. Osteosarcoma, a primary malignant bone tumor, is characterized by the abnormal growth of osteoblasts. Previous studies have shown that the activity of the PhnCDE complex is dysregulated in osteosarcoma cells, leading to uncontrolled proliferation and increased metastatic potential. The potential relationship between PhnCDE and the Wnt signaling pathway, a critical regulator of osteosarcoma development, has also garnered attention. Investigating the interplay between PhnCDE and Wnt signaling may provide valuable insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying osteosarcoma progression and could offer novel therapeutic targets for this aggressive cancer.
