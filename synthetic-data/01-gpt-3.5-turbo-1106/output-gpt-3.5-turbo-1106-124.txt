prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: serine/threonine protein kinase. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, the impact of a small molecule inhibitor on the activity of the serine/threonine protein kinase was explored. Administration of the inhibitor resulted in a significant decrease in the proliferation of cancer cells harboring mutations in the gene encoding the kinase. Additionally, treatment with the inhibitor led to a reduction in the levels of phosphorylated proteins involved in cell cycle regulation. Furthermore, in vivo studies in a mouse model demonstrated a marked decrease in tumor growth following administration of the inhibitor. Collectively, these findings suggest a potential therapeutic strategy for targeting the serine/threonine protein kinase in cancer treatment.
