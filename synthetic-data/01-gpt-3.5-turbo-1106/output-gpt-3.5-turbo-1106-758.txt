prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: dolichol-phosphate-mannose synthase. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we investigated the role of the dolichol-phosphate-mannose synthase (DPM synthase) in the pathogenesis of Congenital Disorders of Glycosylation (CDG). We utilized a DPM synthase knockout mouse model to delineate the impact of DPM synthase deficiency on the N-glycosylation process. Our results indicate that DPM synthase deficiency leads to aberrant N-glycosylation patterns, resulting in impaired protein glycosylation and subsequent developmental abnormalities. Furthermore, our findings demonstrate the potential utility of targeting DPM synthase as a therapeutic intervention for CDG and other related glycosylation disorders. This elucidation of the critical role of DPM synthase in glycosylation pathways sheds light on possible avenues for novel therapeutic strategies in the treatment of CDG.
