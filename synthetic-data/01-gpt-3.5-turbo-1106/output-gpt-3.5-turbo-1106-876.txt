prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: PAXT. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In recent years, the PAXT complex has emerged as a critical regulator of mRNA surveillance and degradation in eukaryotic cells. The complex, comprised of PAXT-1, PAXT-2, and PAXT-3 subunits, plays a fundamental role in maintaining the quality control of mRNA transcripts by recognizing and targeting aberrant or unwanted transcripts for degradation. Dysfunction of the PAXT complex has been linked to various human diseases, including neurodegenerative disorders and cancer. Additionally, the PAXT complex has been implicated in response to cellular stress and environmental insults, highlighting its importance in maintaining cellular homeostasis. Understanding the molecular mechanisms governing the PAXT complex has the potential to yield valuable insights into the pathogenesis of diverse human diseases and may offer new therapeutic strategies for intervention.
