prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: IPMDHs. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we investigated the role of isopropylmalate dehydrogenases (IPMDHs) in the development of prostate cancer. Our findings demonstrate a significant upregulation of IPMDHs in prostate cancer tissue compared to normal tissue. Furthermore, we also observed a positive correlation between IPMDHs expression levels and tumor size and aggressiveness. Functional analysis revealed that high IPMDHs expression is associated with increased glutamine metabolism and the activation of the mTOR signaling pathway. These results suggest a potential involvement of IPMDHs in the metabolic reprogramming of prostate cancer cells, providing a promising target for therapeutic intervention. Overall, our study highlights the significance of IPMDHs in prostate cancer progression and the potential for IPMDHs inhibition as a strategy for therapeutic intervention in the treatment of this disease.
