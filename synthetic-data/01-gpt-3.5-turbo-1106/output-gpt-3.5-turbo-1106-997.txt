prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: pyrophosphate-dependent phosphofructokinases. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we investigated the role of the pyrophosphate-dependent phosphofructokinases (PPi-PFK) in the pathogenesis of Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Using a mouse model of T2DM, we observed a significant downregulation of PPi-PFK expression in adipose tissue, liver, and skeletal muscle. Furthermore, our findings revealed a correlation between decreased PPi-PFK activity and an impaired glucose metabolism in T2DM mice. Subsequent experiments demonstrated that pharmacological activation of PPi-PFK led to improved glucose tolerance and reduced insulin resistance in the animal model. These results suggest a potential therapeutic target for T2DM intervention through modulation of PPi-PFK activity. Further investigation into the molecular mechanisms underlying the interaction of PPi-PFK with glucose metabolism may provide new insights into T2DM pathophysiology and potential treatment strategies.
