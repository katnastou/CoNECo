prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: plasma lipoprotein particles. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, the role of plasma lipoprotein particles in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis was investigated. Atherosclerosis is a chronic inflammatory disease characterized by the accumulation of lipids and fibrous elements in the arterial walls, leading to the formation of atherosclerotic plaques. The influence of plasma lipoprotein particles on the development and progression of atherosclerosis has been well established. In particular, high levels of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) particles have been implicated in the initiation and progression of atherosclerotic lesions. However, the involvement of other types of plasma lipoprotein particles, such as high-density lipoprotein (HDL) particles, in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis remains less clear. This study aimed to elucidate the specific contributions of different plasma lipoprotein particles to the pathophysiology of atherosclerosis, with the goal of identifying potential targets for therapeutic intervention.
