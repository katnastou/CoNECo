prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: methylosome. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The methylosome is a crucial protein complex involved in the regulation of gene expression through the modulation of DNA methylation patterns. Previous studies have indicated the significance of the methylosome in various disease states, including cancer and neurodevelopmental disorders. The methylosome is known to interact with several methyltransferases and regulatory proteins, contributing to the fine-tuning of epigenetic modifications. Recent research has also implicated the methylosome in the pathogenesis of certain metabolic disorders, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target for such conditions. Further investigations into the mechanisms underlying the function of the methylosome are warranted to unravel its role in disease pathology and potential for targeted therapeutic interventions.
