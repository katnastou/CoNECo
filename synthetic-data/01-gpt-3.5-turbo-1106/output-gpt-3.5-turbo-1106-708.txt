prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: AMPA glutamate receptors. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: AMPA glutamate receptors are widely expressed in the central nervous system and play a crucial role in mediating fast excitatory synaptic transmission. Recent studies have highlighted the involvement of AMPA glutamate receptors in various neurological disorders, including Alzheimer's disease, epilepsy, and ischemic stroke. The interaction between these receptors and auxiliary subunits, such as TARPs, CYFIP2, and CKAMP44, contributes to the modulation of their activity and trafficking. Furthermore, small molecule modulators of AMPA glutamate receptors have shown promise in preclinical models of neurological disorders, suggesting their potential as therapeutic targets. Understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying the regulation and function of AMPA glutamate receptors may offer insights into the development of novel treatment strategies for neurological disorders.
