prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: Pol delta. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: Recent studies have pointed to the critical role of Pol delta in the context of DNA replication and repair mechanisms. Pol delta is a key participant in the fidelity of genetic transfer and maintenance, providing crucial support for the accurate and efficient synthesis of DNA. Dysfunction of Pol delta has been implicated in various genetic disorders and cancer types, making it a promising target for therapeutic intervention. Further investigation into the regulation and functional dynamics of Pol delta is warranted to better understand its contribution to disease pathology and to facilitate the development of novel treatment strategies. This research may yield insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying cancer and other genetic diseases and present opportunities for the development of targeted therapies.
