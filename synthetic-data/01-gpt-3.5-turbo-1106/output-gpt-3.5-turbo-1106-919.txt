prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: MutLbeta. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In the context of colorectal cancer (CRC) pathogenesis, MutLbeta plays a crucial role in the mediation of DNA mismatch repair (MMR) processes. The dysregulation of MutLbeta has been associated with an increased mutational load and microsatellite instability in CRC, further implicating its involvement in tumor development. Recent studies have identified a potential link between MutLbeta and chemotherapeutic resistance in CRC patients, highlighting the clinical significance of this protein complex. Furthermore, investigations into the impact of MutLbeta on the response to 5-fluorouracil-based chemotherapy have underscored its potential as a predictive biomarker for treatment outcomes in CRC. These findings collectively underscore the pivotal role of MutLbeta in CRC progression and therapeutic responsiveness, warranting further exploration of its molecular mechanisms and clinical implications.
