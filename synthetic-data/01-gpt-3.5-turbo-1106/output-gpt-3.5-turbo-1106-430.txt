prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: lipopolysaccharide receptors. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we investigated the role of lipopolysaccharide receptors in the pathogenesis of sepsis-induced acute lung injury. Our results revealed a significant upregulation of lipopolysaccharide receptors in lung tissues of septic mice compared to control animals. Furthermore, we observed a parallel increase in the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor alpha and interleukin-6, in the lung parenchyma following lipopolysaccharide exposure. Importantly, administration of a specific inhibitor targeting lipopolysaccharide receptors attenuated the pulmonary inflammation and improved overall survival in our sepsis model. These findings highlight the potential of lipopolysaccharide receptors as a therapeutic target for mitigating sepsis-associated lung injury.
