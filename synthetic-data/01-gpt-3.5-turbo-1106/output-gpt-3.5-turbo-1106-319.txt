prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: IgM. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we investigated the role of IgM in the context of autoimmune diseases. Previous research has shown that IgM levels are altered in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus and rheumatoid arthritis. Our findings suggest that IgM may play a crucial role in modulating the immune response and influencing disease pathology. We also observed a correlation between IgM levels and disease severity, indicating a potential diagnostic and prognostic value for IgM in these conditions. Furthermore, our study found that IgM-targeted therapy resulted in a reduction of inflammatory markers and improved clinical outcomes in a murine model of autoimmune disease. These results provide valuable insights into the potential therapeutic applications of IgM modulation in autoimmune disorders.
