prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: PAN. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The peroxisome assembly network (PAN) is a critical protein complex involved in the biogenesis and maintenance of peroxisomes, essential organelles responsible for various metabolic functions in eukaryotic cells. Dysregulation of PAN has been implicated in peroxisomal disorders, such as Zellweger syndrome and Rhizomelic chondrodysplasia punctata, which are characterized by impaired peroxisome function and metabolism of various lipids and reactive oxygen species. A deficiency or aberrant function of PAN has also been associated with dyslipidemia and oxidative stress-related diseases, highlighting its importance in maintaining cellular homeostasis. Understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying the regulation and assembly of PAN could offer valuable insights into the pathophysiology of peroxisomal disorders and potential therapeutic targets for their intervention.
