prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: diamine N-acetyltransferase. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: A recent study investigated the role of the diamine N-acetyltransferase (DNAT) protein complex in the pathogenesis of Schistosoma mansoni infection. Using a murine model, the researchers demonstrated that DNAT levels were significantly elevated in infected liver tissues compared to uninfected controls. Furthermore, immunohistochemical analysis revealed an increased presence of DNAT in the granulomatous lesions surrounding parasite eggs. To elucidate the functional significance of this observation, the researchers utilized a specific inhibitor of DNAT activity, resulting in a significant reduction in granuloma formation and hepatic fibrosis. These findings signify a potential therapeutic target to modulate the host immune response in schistosomiasis. Further investigation into the precise role of DNAT in modulating inflammation and fibrosis in parasitic infections is warranted.
