prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: PGH. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The PGH complex has been well-studied in the context of inflammatory diseases, where it is implicated in the regulation of prostaglandin synthesis. Recent studies have identified a potential link between PGH and neuroinflammatory responses, suggesting a role for this complex in the pathogenesis of certain neurological disorders. Furthermore, the dysregulation of PGH has been associated with increased susceptibility to cardiovascular diseases, providing valuable insights into the potential therapeutic targets for this complex. Understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying the function of the PGH complex may pave the way for the development of novel treatments for a wide range of inflammatory and cardiovascular conditions.
