prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: putrescine N-acetyltransferase. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: A recent study investigated the role of putrescine N-acetyltransferase in the pathogenesis of colorectal cancer. Analysis of tissue samples from patients with colorectal cancer revealed a significant upregulation of putrescine N-acetyltransferase expression compared to healthy controls. Further in vitro studies demonstrated that inhibition of putrescine N-acetyltransferase using a selective small molecule inhibitor resulted in decreased proliferation and viability of colorectal cancer cells, suggesting a potential therapeutic target for this disease. Additionally, the study identified a correlation between putrescine N-acetyltransferase expression and tumor size, stage, and metastasis, highlighting the potential of putrescine N-acetyltransferase as a prognostic marker for colorectal cancer progression. These findings provide insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying colorectal cancer and support the development of putrescine N-acetyltransferase inhibitors as a novel therapeutic approach for this deadly disease.
