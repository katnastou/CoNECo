prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: Gin4. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The Gin4 protein complex has recently attracted attention in the field of cell biology due to its crucial role in the regulation of the cell cycle and the maintenance of cell wall integrity in yeast. Studies have demonstrated that the absence of Gin4 results in aberrant septin organization and leads to defects in cytokinesis, ultimately causing cell lysis. Moreover, Gin4 has been implicated in the response to cell wall stress, as its overexpression confers resistance to antifungal agents. Further research is warranted to fully elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying the functions of the Gin4 protein complex and its potential implications for the development of novel antifungal therapies.
