prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: radial spokes. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: Our research focused on investigating the role of the radial spokes protein complex in ciliary motility and its potential implications in primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD). Using high-resolution microscopy and biochemical assays, we elucidated the structural organization and functional importance of the radial spokes in coordinating ciliary beating. Our findings revealed a critical association between radial spokes and the regulation of dynein-driven microtubule sliding, thereby implicating their direct involvement in the maintenance of proper ciliary motility. Furthermore, we identified novel candidate genes associated with the radial spokes assembly, shedding light on potential genetic determinants of PCD. This study underscores the significance of the radial spokes in ciliary function and highlights their potential as a target for therapeutic intervention in PCD.
