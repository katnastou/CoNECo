prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: extracellular ribonucleoprotein. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we investigated the role of the extracellular ribonucleoprotein complex in the pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis. We analyzed synovial fluid samples from patients with rheumatoid arthritis and healthy controls to assess the levels of extracellular ribonucleoprotein. Our results revealed a significant increase in the levels of extracellular ribonucleoprotein in the synovial fluid of patients with rheumatoid arthritis compared to healthy controls. Furthermore, we found a positive correlation between the levels of extracellular ribonucleoprotein and disease activity, as measured by the Disease Activity Score. These findings suggest that the extracellular ribonucleoprotein complex may play a role in the inflammatory cascade in rheumatoid arthritis and could serve as a potential biomarker for disease activity. Further investigation into the mechanisms underlying the extracellular ribonucleoprotein complex in rheumatoid arthritis may provide novel therapeutic targets for this debilitating disease.
