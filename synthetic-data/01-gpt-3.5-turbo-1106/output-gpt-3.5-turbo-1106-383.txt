prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: mitofilin. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The role of mitofilin in mitochondrial function has garnered significant attention in recent years. Mitofilin is a key component of the mitochondrial inner membrane protein complex, playing a pivotal role in maintaining the structural integrity and functionality of the mitochondria. Mutations in the mitofilin gene have been implicated in various mitochondrial disorders, including Barth syndrome and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Recent studies have focused on the potential therapeutic targeting of mitofilin to improve mitochondrial function and mitigate the pathological consequences of mitochondrial dysfunction. Further investigations into the molecular mechanisms underlying the involvement of mitofilin in mitochondrial pathology are warranted, with potential implications for the development of novel therapeutic interventions for mitochondrial disorders.
