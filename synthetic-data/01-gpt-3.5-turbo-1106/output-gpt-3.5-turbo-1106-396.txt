prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: SF3B. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The SF3B protein complex has garnered significant attention due to its crucial role in pre-mRNA splicing, a fundamental process in eukaryotic gene expression. Dysregulation of splicing has been implicated in various disease states, including myelodysplastic syndromes and certain cancers. Recent research has revealed potential therapeutic targets within the SF3B complex, with small molecule inhibitors showing promise in preclinical studies. Furthermore, genetic analyses have identified mutations in SF3B components associated with specific disease subtypes, emphasizing the need for further exploration of the complex's function in normal physiology and pathology. This growing body of evidence underscores the importance of understanding SF3B in both health and disease, offering potential avenues for novel therapeutic interventions.
