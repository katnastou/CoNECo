prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: NAD(P)H-dependent FMN reductase. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we investigated the role of the NAD(P)H-dependent FMN reductase in the pathogenesis of diabetic nephropathy. Utilizing a diabetic mouse model, we observed a significant upregulation of NAD(P)H-dependent FMN reductase activity in the renal tissue compared to non-diabetic controls. Furthermore, we elucidated the downstream effect of increased NAD(P)H-dependent FMN reductase activity on the generation of reactive oxygen species and subsequent oxidative stress in the kidney. Our findings suggest that targeting NAD(P)H-dependent FMN reductase may represent a potential therapeutic strategy for mitigating diabetic nephropathy and its associated renal complications.
