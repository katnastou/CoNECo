prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: ESCRT I. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The ESCRT I protein complex, which consists of TSG101, VPS28, VPS37, and MVB12 subunits, plays a crucial role in the endosomal sorting complex required for transport (ESCRT) pathway. Defective ESCRT I function has been implicated in several human diseases, including the development of dysfunctional multivesicular bodies (MVBs) and the subsequent impaired degradation of ubiquitinated membrane proteins. Furthermore, ESCRT I dysfunction has been associated with the progression of viral infections, such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), by disrupting the biogenesis of viral particles. The intricate interplay between ESCRT I and various cellular processes underscores the importance of understanding its mechanistic involvement in both normal physiology and disease states. Furthermore, targeting ESCRT I components may hold potential as a therapeutic strategy for diseases involving defects in the ESCRT pathway.
