prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: fibrinogen. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we aimed to investigate the role of fibrinogen in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis in a mouse model. Through histological examination of arterial tissues from control and fibrinogen-deficient mice, we observed a significant reduction in atherosclerotic plaque formation in the absence of fibrinogen. Moreover, plasma levels of cholesterol and triglycerides were found to be lower in the fibrinogen-deficient mice compared to the control group, suggesting a potential link between fibrinogen and lipid metabolism. Additionally, immunohistochemical analysis revealed a decrease in macrophage infiltration in the arterial walls of fibrinogen-deficient mice, indicating an attenuated inflammatory response. Our findings suggest that fibrinogen may play a critical role in the initiation and progression of atherosclerosis, highlighting its potential significance as a therapeutic target for cardiovascular diseases.
