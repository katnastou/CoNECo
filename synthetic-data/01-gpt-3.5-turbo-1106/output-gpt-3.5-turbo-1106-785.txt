prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: pyroptosomes. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The recent discovery of the protein complex pyroptosomes has brought attention to its crucial role in the regulation of inflammatory responses. Pyroptosomes have been shown to be activated in response to pathogen-associated molecular patterns, leading to the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines that contribute to the host defense against infection. Additionally, pyroptosomes have been implicated in the pathogenesis of several inflammatory diseases, including sepsis, rheumatoid arthritis, and inflammatory bowel disease. The elucidation of the molecular mechanisms underlying the formation and activation of pyroptosomes presents an exciting avenue for the development of novel therapeutic strategies targeting inflammatory disorders. Further investigation into the functions and regulatory pathways of pyroptosomes is warranted to fully comprehend their potential as a therapeutic target for inflammatory diseases.
