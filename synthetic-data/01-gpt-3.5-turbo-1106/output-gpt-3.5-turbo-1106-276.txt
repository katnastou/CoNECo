prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: Swm. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The Swm protein complex is a key player in the regulation of cellular signaling pathways associated with multiple cancer types. Previous studies have demonstrated that dysregulation of the Swm complex is linked to elevated levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and subsequent oxidative stress in cancer cells. Here, we report the identification of a novel small molecule inhibitor targeting the Swm complex, which effectively reduces tumor growth in a mouse model of melanoma. Additionally, we show that this inhibitor mitigates tumor-induced inflammation and inhibits angiogenesis in vivo. These findings suggest that targeting the Swm complex may represent a promising therapeutic strategy for the treatment of cancer, particularly in the context of oxidative stress-associated pathologies.
