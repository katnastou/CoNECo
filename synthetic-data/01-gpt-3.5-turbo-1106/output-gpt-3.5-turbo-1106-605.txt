prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: MalFGK(2). Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: Recent research has identified a potential role for the MalFGK(2) protein complex in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). A study conducted on a murine model of IBD demonstrated elevated expression of MalFGK(2) in the colonic epithelium of affected animals compared to healthy controls. Furthermore, treatment with a specific inhibitor of MalFGK(2) leads to a reduction in pro-inflammatory cytokine levels and amelioration of intestinal inflammation in the animal model. These findings suggest that MalFGK(2) may play a crucial role in the regulation of intestinal immune response and could be a potential therapeutic target for the management of IBD. Further investigation into the molecular mechanisms underlying the involvement of MalFGK(2) in IBD pathogenesis is warranted.
