prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: axonemal dynein heavy chain. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we investigated the role of the axonemal dynein heavy chain in the context of ciliary function and its potential implications for primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD). Using a murine model, we examined the impact of axonemal dynein heavy chain deficiency on ciliary motility and observed significant impairment in ciliary beating frequency and coordination. Furthermore, we explored the molecular interactions between axonemal dynein heavy chain and regulatory signaling pathways, such as the nitric oxide synthase family, which has been implicated in ciliary dysfunction. Our findings suggest that dysregulation of axonemal dynein heavy chain may contribute to the pathogenesis of PCD, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target for restoring ciliary function in individuals with PCD.
