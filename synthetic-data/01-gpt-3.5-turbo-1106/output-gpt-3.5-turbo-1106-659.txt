prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: NPC. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The nuclear pore complex (NPC) is a large protein structure that spans the nuclear envelope, serving as the gatekeeper for the transport of macromolecules between the cytoplasm and the nucleus. Dysfunction of the NPC has been implicated in various human diseases, including cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, and viral infections. Recent studies have revealed the involvement of specific viral proteins in hijacking the NPC to facilitate the nuclear import of viral genomes, highlighting the critical role of this complex in viral pathogenesis. Targeting the NPC has emerged as a potential therapeutic strategy for inhibiting viral replication and limiting the spread of viral infections. Furthermore, the identification of small molecules that modulate NPC function holds promise for the development of novel treatments for diseases associated with NPC dysfunction.
