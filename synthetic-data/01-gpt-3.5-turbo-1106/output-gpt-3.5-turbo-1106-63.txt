prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: centromeric nucleosome. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The centromeric nucleosome is a critical component of the mitotic spindle assembly and is essential for proper chromosome segregation during cell division. Dysfunction or misregulation of the centromeric nucleosome has been implicated in a variety of human diseases, including cancer and developmental disorders. Emerging evidence suggests that the centromeric nucleosome interacts with a diverse array of cellular factors, including histone modifiers and chromatin remodelers, to maintain its structural integrity and function. These interactions are crucial for ensuring the fidelity of chromosome segregation and genome stability. Additionally, small molecules targeting the centromeric nucleosome may hold therapeutic potential for treating diseases associated with chromosomal instability. Further research into the molecular mechanisms governing the centromeric nucleosome's function and regulation is warranted to uncover novel targets for therapeutic intervention and to deepen our understanding of its role in human health and disease.
