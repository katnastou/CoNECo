prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: RNA-directed RNA polymerases. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The RNA-directed RNA polymerases (RDRPs) represent a critical class of enzymes involved in the regulation of gene expression and several regulatory processes in eukaryotic organisms. Previous studies have indicated their importance in antiviral defense mechanisms and RNA interference pathways. Recent investigations have also suggested potential roles of RDRPs in the pathogenesis of certain viral infections and autoimmune disorders. Given the emerging interest in therapeutic development targeting RNA-based mechanisms, further elucidation of the molecular functions and interactions of RNA-directed RNA polymerases is essential for advancing our understanding of biological processes and disease pathogenesis.
