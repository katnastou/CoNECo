prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: PRC2. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In recent years, the protein complex PRC2 has emerged as a key player in the regulation of gene expression in various disease states. PRC2 has been implicated in the pathogenesis of several cancers, including prostate cancer and breast cancer, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target. The enzymatic activity of PRC2 has been shown to be modulated by small molecule inhibitors, such as GSK343, leading to alterations in chromatin structure and gene transcription. Furthermore, studies in mouse models have demonstrated the essential role of PRC2 in embryonic development, underscoring its significance in organismal biology. These findings position PRC2 as a critical molecular entity with broad implications for both basic research and clinical applications.
