prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: import inner membrane translocases. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The import inner membrane translocases (IIMTs) are essential protein complexes involved in the translocation of proteins across the inner membrane of the mitochondria. Dysfunction of IIMTs has been associated with various mitochondrial disorders, including mitochondrial myopathies and neurodegenerative diseases. Previous studies have highlighted the role of certain small molecules in modulating the activity of IIMTs, presenting potential therapeutic targets for these diseases. Furthermore, recent research has implicated IIMTs in the regulation of cellular metabolism and apoptosis, suggesting a broader impact of these complexes on cellular homeostasis. Elucidating the molecular mechanisms underlying the function of IIMTs may ultimately lead to the development of novel therapeutic strategies for mitochondrial diseases.
