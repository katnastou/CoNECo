prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: Choriogonadotropin. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In recent years, the role of Choriogonadotropin in promoting the growth and development of trophoblastic tissue has garnered significant attention in the field of reproductive biology. Studies have indicated that the dysregulation of Choriogonadotropin expression may contribute to the pathogenesis of gestational trophoblastic disease, a rare but serious condition characterized by abnormal trophoblastic proliferation. Furthermore, investigations into the potential use of Choriogonadotropin levels as a biomarker for certain pregnancy-related complications have shown promising results. These findings have prompted further research into the underlying mechanisms of Choriogonadotropin action and its potential implications for the diagnosis and management of trophoblastic diseases.
