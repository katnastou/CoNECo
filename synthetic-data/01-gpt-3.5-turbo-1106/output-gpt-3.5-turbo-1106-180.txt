prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: efflux pump. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: Recent studies have shed light on the role of the efflux pump in microbial drug resistance. This protein complex, found in various pathogenic bacteria, is known to actively extrude a wide range of antibiotics and other antimicrobial agents from the bacterial cell, thus decreasing the intracellular drug concentration and conferring resistance. The overexpression of efflux pump has been associated with multidrug resistance in several bacterial species, posing a significant challenge in the treatment of infections caused by these pathogens. Understanding the mechanisms and regulation of the efflux pump activity is crucial for the development of new strategies to combat drug-resistant infections. Additionally, the investigation of efflux pump inhibitors and their potential use in combination therapy to enhance the efficacy of existing antibiotics holds promise for overcoming microbial drug resistance.
