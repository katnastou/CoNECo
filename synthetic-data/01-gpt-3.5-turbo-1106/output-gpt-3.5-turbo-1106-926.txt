model: gpt-3.5-turbo-1106
prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: tubulin folding cofactor. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The tubulin folding cofactor is a vital chaperone protein complex involved in the proper folding of alpha- and beta-tubulin heterodimers, essential components of the microtubule cytoskeleton. Dysfunction of the tubulin folding cofactor has been linked to severe phenotypes in various model organisms, including developmental defects, impaired cellular motility, and aberrant neuronal development. Chemical compounds targeting the interaction between tubulin folding cofactor and tubulin have shown promise in preclinical studies for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases and certain cancers. Understanding the molecular mechanisms governing the assembly and regulation of the tubulin folding cofactor holds promise for the development of novel therapeutics targeting microtubule dynamics and cellular motility in health and disease.
