prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: cullin. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The role of the cullin protein complex in the regulation of cell cycle progression and cancer development has been a subject of intense investigation in recent years. This study aimed to elucidate the biochemical and functional properties of the cullin complex in the context of tumorigenesis using a mouse model of colorectal cancer. Our results demonstrate that the cullin complex plays a critical role in promoting the degradation of oncogenic proteins and the maintenance of genomic stability, thus influencing the progression of colorectal cancer. Furthermore, we identified small molecule inhibitors of the cullin complex that showed potent anti-tumor activity in in vivo mouse models, suggesting a potential therapeutic strategy for colorectal cancer treatment. This study provides valuable insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying the role of the cullin complex in cancer biology and highlights its potential as a target for novel anti-cancer therapies.
