prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: fumarate reductase. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we investigated the role of fumarate reductase in the pathogenesis of colorectal cancer. We used a mouse model of colorectal cancer to examine the expression and activity of fumarate reductase in tumor tissues. Our results showed a significant upregulation of fumarate reductase in the tumor microenvironment compared to normal colon tissue. Furthermore, we observed an association between fumarate reductase expression and tumor progression, as higher levels of this protein complex were correlated with advanced stages of cancer. Our findings suggest that fumarate reductase may play a crucial role in the metabolic reprogramming of colorectal cancer cells, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target for this disease.
