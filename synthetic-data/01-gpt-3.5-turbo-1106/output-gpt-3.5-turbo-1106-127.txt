model: gpt-3.5-turbo-1106
prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: gamma-tubulin large. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The gamma-tubulin large (G-TuLP) protein complex plays a critical role in the nucleation of microtubules, which are essential for maintaining the structural integrity of the cytoskeleton and facilitating intracellular transport. This complex has been implicated in a wide range of cellular processes, including cell division, motility, and organelle positioning. Dysregulation of G-TuLP has been associated with various pathological conditions, such as cancer and neurodegenerative diseases, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target. Understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying the function of G-TuLP is crucial for developing novel interventions to modulate its activity and ultimately treat disorders associated with microtubule dysfunction.
