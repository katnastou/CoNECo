prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: potassium/sodium hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated channel 2. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The potassium/sodium hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated channel 2 (HCN2) is a crucial regulator of neuronal excitability and neurotransmission. Recent studies have implicated HCN2 dysfunction in the pathophysiology of epilepsy, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target for managing seizure disorders. Furthermore, the role of HCN2 in modulating cardiac pacemaking has sparked interest in its involvement in arrhythmias, suggesting its possible implication in various cardiovascular diseases. Additionally, alterations in HCN2 expression have been linked to disparate pain conditions, prompting exploration of its therapeutic potential in managing chronic pain syndromes. The multifaceted involvement of HCN2 in diverse physiological processes underscores its significance in both normal and pathological conditions, warranting further investigation into its therapeutic implications across various biomedical disciplines.
