prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: editosomes. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The role of the editosomes in RNA editing has been a subject of extensive investigation in recent years. Editosomes are large, multiprotein complexes that play a crucial role in the post-transcriptional modification of RNA. Their involvement in processes such as alternative splicing and site-specific modification has implications for a variety of diseases, including cancer and neurological disorders. This research has also shed light on potential therapeutic targets for conditions characterized by dysregulated RNA editing. Furthermore, the development of small molecule modulators of editosome function may provide a promising avenue for the treatment of these diseases. The intricate interplay between editosomes and RNA substrates, as well as the complex network of interacting proteins, presents a fertile ground for further exploration and potential therapeutic intervention.
