prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: isopropylmalate isomerases. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we aimed to investigate the role of isopropylmalate isomerases in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease. Previous research has indicated that dysregulation of these enzymes may lead to an accumulation of toxic metabolites, contributing to neurodegenerative processes. Using a transgenic mouse model overexpressing the amyloid precursor protein, we observed a significant upregulation of isopropylmalate isomerases in brain tissue compared to wild-type controls. Furthermore, mass spectrometry analysis revealed altered levels of metabolites in the transgenic mice, implicating a potential link between isopropylmalate isomerases and metabolic dysfunction in the context of Alzheimer's disease. These findings shed light on a novel pathway for further exploration in the development of therapeutic interventions targeting the dysregulation of isopropylmalate isomerases in neurodegenerative disorders.
