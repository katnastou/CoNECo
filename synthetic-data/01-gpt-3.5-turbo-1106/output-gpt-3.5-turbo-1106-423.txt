prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: adenylyltransferases. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: Adenylyltransferases, also known as ATP-dependent adenylyltransferases, play a crucial role in intracellular signaling pathways. These enzymes are involved in the transfer of adenosine monophosphate (AMP) to various target molecules, leading to the modification of their activity. The dysregulation of adenylyltransferases has been implicated in several pathological conditions, including metabolic disorders and cancer. Recent studies have revealed potential therapeutic targets to modulate the activity of adenylyltransferases, opening new avenues for developing novel interventions for these diseases. Further investigation into the molecular mechanisms underlying the function of adenylyltransferases and their involvement in disease pathogenesis is warranted to facilitate the development of targeted therapies aimed at restoring cellular homeostasis.
