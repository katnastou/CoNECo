prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: voltage-sensitive calcium channel. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In recent years, the voltage-sensitive calcium channel has emerged as a pivotal player in the pathophysiology of various neurological disorders, including epilepsy and migraine. Multiple lines of evidence have highlighted the critical role of this ion channel complex in regulating neuronal excitability and neurotransmitter release. Furthermore, dysregulation of the voltage-sensitive calcium channel has been implicated in the aberrant synaptic transmission associated with chronic pain conditions. The development of novel pharmacological agents targeting this channel holds great promise for the treatment of these debilitating neurological disorders. Future studies investigating the intricate interplay between the voltage-sensitive calcium channel and other synaptic proteins are warranted to elucidate the underlying mechanisms and facilitate the development of targeted therapies.
