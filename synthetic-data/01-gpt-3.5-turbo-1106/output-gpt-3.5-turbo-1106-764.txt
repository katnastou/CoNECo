prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: L-glutamate dehydrogenases. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, the role of L-glutamate dehydrogenases in neurodegenerative diseases was investigated. It has been previously established that perturbations in the function of this protein complex can lead to dysregulation of the glutamate neurotransmitter system, which is implicated in various neurological disorders. Using a mouse model, the impact of L-glutamate dehydrogenases inhibition on glutamate levels in the brain was examined. The results demonstrated a significant increase in extracellular glutamate concentrations, supporting the theory that dysregulation of L-glutamate dehydrogenases can lead to glutamate excitotoxicity, a hallmark of neurodegenerative conditions. These findings have important implications for the development of novel therapeutic strategies targeting L-glutamate dehydrogenases to mitigate glutamate-related neurotoxicity in neurodegenerative diseases.
