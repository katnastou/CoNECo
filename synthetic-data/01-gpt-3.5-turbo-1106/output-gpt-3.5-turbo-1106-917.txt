prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: succinic dehydrogenase. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we investigated the role of succinic dehydrogenase in the pathogenesis of hepatocellular carcinoma. Our results demonstrate a significant upregulation of succinic dehydrogenase in tumor tissues compared to adjacent normal liver tissue. Furthermore, we found that the expression of succinic dehydrogenase positively correlates with tumor size and stage, suggesting a potential involvement of succinic dehydrogenase in the progression of hepatocellular carcinoma. Additionally, our findings reveal a strong association between succinic dehydrogenase expression and the activation of the hypoxia-inducible factor 1Î± pathway, highlighting a potential link between succinic dehydrogenase and tumor hypoxia. These results provide valuable insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying hepatocellular carcinoma and point to succinic dehydrogenase as a potential therapeutic target for this aggressive malignancy.
