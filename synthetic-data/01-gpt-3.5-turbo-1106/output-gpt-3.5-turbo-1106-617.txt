prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: TCC. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The complement system plays a crucial role in the immune response to various pathogens and in the maintenance of tissue homeostasis. One of the key effector mechanisms of the complement system is the formation of the membrane attack complex (MAC). The MAC, consisting of C5b, C6, C7, C8, and C9, is responsible for the lysis of target cells and the elimination of pathogens. Recent studies have identified a novel regulator of MAC assembly, the TCC, which has been shown to modulate complement activation and inflammatory responses. Furthermore, dysregulation of TCC has been implicated in various immune-related diseases, including atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome and systemic lupus erythematosus. Understanding the regulatory mechanisms of TCC could provide insights for the development of novel therapeutic strategies for complement-mediated diseases.
