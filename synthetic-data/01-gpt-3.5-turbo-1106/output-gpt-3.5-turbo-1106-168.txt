prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: 5HT-3A receptor. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we investigate the impact of a novel small molecule inhibitor on the function of the 5HT-3A receptor in an in vivo model of chemotherapy-induced emesis. We employed a murine model and administered the chemotherapeutic agent cisplatin to induce emetic behavior. Our findings reveal that pre-treatment with the small molecule inhibitor significantly attenuates the emetic response, suggesting a potential therapeutic target for managing chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting in cancer patients. These results highlight the importance of targeting the 5HT-3A receptor in the development of antiemetic agents for improving the quality of life for cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy.
