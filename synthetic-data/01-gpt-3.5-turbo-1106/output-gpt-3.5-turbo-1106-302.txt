prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: proteasome-activating nucleotidase. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we investigated the role of the proteasome-activating nucleotidase in the progression of Alzheimer's disease. Our findings suggest that the dysregulation of proteasome-activating nucleotidase activity may contribute to the accumulation of misfolded proteins implicated in neurodegenerative disorders. Using a transgenic mouse model of Alzheimer's disease, we observed a decrease in proteasome-activating nucleotidase expression in brain tissue, accompanied by a concomitant increase in amyloid-beta plaques and neurofibrillary tangles. Furthermore, pharmacological modulation of proteasome-activating nucleotidase activity resulted in a significant reduction in amyloid-beta burden. These results provide valuable insights into the potential therapeutic targeting of proteasome-activating nucleotidase as a novel approach for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease.
