prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: nuclear pore. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we investigated the extracellular signals that regulate the localization and function of the nuclear pore in human cells. Our findings indicate that the nuclear pore is influenced by the presence of certain growth factors, such as epidermal growth factor (EGF) and insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1). We demonstrated that treatment with these growth factors led to a reorganization of nuclear pore distribution within the nucleus, affecting the transport of macromolecules across the nuclear envelope. Additionally, our data suggest that dysregulation of nuclear pore function may contribute to the pathophysiology of certain neurodegenerative diseases, providing a potential link between aberrant nuclear pore activity and disease progression. Understanding the regulatory mechanisms of the nuclear pore has implications for developing novel therapeutic strategies targeting nuclear transport pathways in human health and disease.
