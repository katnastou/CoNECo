prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: transferases. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The transferases are a class of enzymes that play a crucial role in various cellular processes, including metabolism and protein synthesis. Their dysregulation has been implicated in several human diseases, such as diabetes and cancer. In recent years, the identification of small molecule inhibitors targeting transferases has gained significant attention as potential therapeutic strategies. However, the complex regulatory mechanisms and diverse substrate specificities of transferases present significant challenges in the development of specific and effective inhibitors. Therefore, further research is needed to elucidate the precise molecular mechanisms underlying transferase function and regulation, which could ultimately facilitate the development of novel therapeutic interventions for diseases associated with transferase dysregulation.
