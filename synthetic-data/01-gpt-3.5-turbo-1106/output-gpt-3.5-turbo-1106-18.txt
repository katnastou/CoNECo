prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: Rab geranylgeranyltransferases. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: Rab geranylgeranyltransferases (Rab GGTase) play a pivotal role in the post-translational modification of the Rab family of small GTPases, which are essential for regulating intracellular vesicle trafficking. Dysregulation of Rab GGTase activity has been implicated in various human diseases, including cancer and neurological disorders. Inhibitors targeting Rab GGTase have shown promise in preclinical studies for the treatment of certain types of cancer. However, the specificity of these inhibitors and their potential off-target effects on other geranylgeranylated proteins need to be thoroughly investigated. Furthermore, the development of small molecule modulators that can selectively modulate Rab GGTase activity may hold promise for the treatment of various diseases associated with dysregulated Rab protein function. Therefore, continued research into the molecular mechanisms underlying Rab GGTase activity and the development of selective modulators is crucial for potentially targeting Rab GGTase as a therapeutic strategy for diseases with aberrant Rab protein signaling.
