prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: extracellular ferritin. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: A study was conducted to investigate the role of extracellular ferritin in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's. The research focused on elucidating the potential interaction between extracellular ferritin and amyloid-beta peptide, a key player in Alzheimer's disease progression. In vitro experiments utilizing cultured neuronal cells demonstrated that extracellular ferritin promoted the aggregation and toxicity of amyloid-beta, suggesting a pathological link between these entities. Furthermore, in an in vivo animal model, increased levels of extracellular ferritin were observed in brain tissues affected by neurodegeneration. These findings provide new insights into the potential involvement of extracellular ferritin in neurodegenerative diseases, thereby paving the way for targeted therapeutic interventions to mitigate disease progression.
