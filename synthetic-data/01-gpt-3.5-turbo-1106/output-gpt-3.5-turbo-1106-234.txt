prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: channel-forming toxin. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we investigated the interaction between the channel-forming toxin and lipid membranes. Our findings revealed that the channel-forming toxin induced rapid ion leakage across the lipid bilayer, leading to membrane disruption and cell lysis. Furthermore, we observed distinct structural changes in the lipid bilayer upon exposure to the channel-forming toxin, suggesting a direct interaction between the toxin and the lipid components of the membrane. These findings shed light on the mechanism of action of the channel-forming toxin and its potential implications in the development of novel therapeutic strategies against toxin-mediated pathologies.
