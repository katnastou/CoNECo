prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: IFT-As. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: Intraflagellar transport complex A (IFT-A) is a critical component of the ciliary machinery, responsible for regulating ciliary assembly and maintenance. Dysfunction or mutations in IFT-A have been implicated in a variety of ciliopathy disorders, including Meckel-Gruber syndrome and Bardet-Biedl syndrome. Recent studies have highlighted the essential role of IFT-A in facilitating the transport of signaling molecules and structural proteins within the ciliary compartment, thereby contributing to the regulation of key developmental and homeostatic processes. Furthermore, aberrant IFT-A function has been linked to defects in sensory perception, cellular polarity, and embryonic patterning, shedding light on its pivotal role in vertebrate development and physiology. Elucidating the molecular mechanisms governing the function of IFT-A promises to uncover new therapeutic targets for the treatment of ciliopathies and related disorders, representing a critical avenue for future biomedical research.
