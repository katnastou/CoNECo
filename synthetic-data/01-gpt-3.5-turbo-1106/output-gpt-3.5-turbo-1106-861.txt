prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: Canonical RPA. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: Our study focused on elucidating the role of Canonical RPA in the response to UV-induced DNA damage in human cells. We observed that upon UV exposure, Canonical RPA was recruited to the sites of DNA damage and formed foci in the nucleus, indicating its involvement in the DNA damage response pathway. Furthermore, we found that depletion of Canonical RPA led to increased sensitivity to UV radiation and elevated levels of DNA damage, as evidenced by increased levels of single-strand breaks and thymine dimers. Our findings highlight the crucial role of Canonical RPA in maintaining genome stability in the face of exogenous genotoxic insults, and underscore its potential as a target for therapeutic interventions aimed at ameliorating the effects of UV-induced DNA damage in human health.
