prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: voltage-sensitive calcium channels. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: Voltage-sensitive calcium channels have been implicated in a wide range of physiological functions, playing a key role in synaptic transmission, hormone release, and muscle contraction. Dysregulation of these channels has been associated with various pathological conditions, including hypertension, cardiac arrhythmias, and epilepsy. Understanding the intricate mechanisms governing the function and regulation of voltage-sensitive calcium channels is crucial for the development of novel therapeutic strategies targeting these channels. Recent studies have shed light on the molecular interactions between voltage-sensitive calcium channels and signaling molecules, highlighting potential avenues for pharmacological interventions. Further investigation into the complex regulatory network involving voltage-sensitive calcium channels and their associated proteins is warranted to unravel their precise role in health and disease.
