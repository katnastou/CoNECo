prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: CFIIm. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: Our study aimed to investigate the role of the CFIIm protein complex in the progression of pancreatic cancer. Pancreatic cancer is a devastating disease with limited treatment options, and understanding the molecular mechanisms driving its progression is crucial for the development of effective therapies. In this study, we utilized a combination of in vitro and in vivo models to assess the impact of CFIIm on pancreatic cancer cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. Our findings revealed that CFIIm depletion significantly inhibited the growth and metastatic potential of pancreatic cancer cells. Furthermore, analysis of clinical samples demonstrated a positive correlation between CFIIm expression levels and disease progression in pancreatic cancer patients. These results highlight the potential of targeting CFIIm as a novel therapeutic strategy for combating pancreatic cancer.
