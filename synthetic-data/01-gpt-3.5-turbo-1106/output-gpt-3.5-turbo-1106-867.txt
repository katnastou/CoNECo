prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: cullin-RING ligase 4A. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The ubiquitin-proteasome system plays a critical role in regulating protein turnover and maintaining cellular homeostasis. The cullin-RING ligase 4A (CRL4A) complex has emerged as a key player in this system, mediating the degradation of a wide range of substrates involved in various cellular processes. Recent studies have implicated CRL4A in the pathogenesis of various diseases, including cancer and neurodegenerative disorders. Elucidating the mechanisms underlying the regulation and function of CRL4A may uncover new therapeutic targets for these conditions. Furthermore, investigating the interplay between CRL4A and other cellular pathways could provide insights into the broader network of molecular interactions that govern cellular physiology and disease development.
