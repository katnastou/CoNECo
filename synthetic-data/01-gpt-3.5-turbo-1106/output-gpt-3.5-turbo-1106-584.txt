prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: condensin I. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The condensin I protein complex has been implicated in the regulation of chromosome structure and organization, playing a critical role in cell division and genome maintenance. Dysregulation of condensin I has been associated with various human diseases, including cancer and developmental disorders. Recent studies have focused on understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying the assembly and function of condensin I, shedding light on its involvement in chromatin compaction and segregation. Pharmacological targeting of condensin I may hold promise for therapeutic interventions in diseases characterized by aberrant chromosomal architecture. Future research endeavors are needed to elucidate the precise role of condensin I in genome stability and its potential as a target for drug development.
