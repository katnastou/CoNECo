prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: SNARE. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The vesicle fusion process at the synapse is critical for neurotransmitter release and synaptic transmission. One of the key players in this process is the SNARE protein complex, which mediates the docking and fusion of synaptic vesicles with the presynaptic membrane. Dysfunction of the SNARE complex has been linked to various neurological disorders, including Parkinson's disease and schizophrenia. Recent studies have revealed the intricate regulation of SNARE complex assembly and disassembly, involving various regulatory proteins, such as Munc18 and complexin. Elucidating the molecular mechanisms underlying SNARE complex function and regulation is essential for understanding synaptic function and for developing targeted therapeutic strategies for neurological disorders.
