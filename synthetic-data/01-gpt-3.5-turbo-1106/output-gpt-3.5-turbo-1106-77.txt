prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: Nup84. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The Nup84 protein complex plays a crucial role in the regulation of nucleocytoplasmic transport within eukaryotic cells. Recent studies have shed light on the critical involvement of Nup84 in maintaining the structural integrity of the nuclear pore complex, which facilitates the selective passage of macromolecules between the nucleus and the cytoplasm. Dysregulation of Nup84 has been implicated in various pathological conditions, including cancer metastasis and viral infections. Additionally, the dynamic interactions between Nup84 and other nuclear pore complex components, such as Nup107 and Nup133, have been shown to influence the overall efficiency of nucleocytoplasmic transport processes. Understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying the function of the Nup84 protein complex holds great promise for the development of targeted therapeutic interventions aimed at modulating nucleocytoplasmic transport in disease states.
