prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: mitofilins. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: Mitofilins are integral components of the inner mitochondrial membrane, playing critical roles in mitochondrial morphology, dynamics, and function. Several studies have elucidated the essential functions of mitofilins in maintaining mitochondrial ultrastructure and regulating cristae organization. Moreover, emerging evidence suggests that mitofilins are involved in the pathology of neurodegenerative diseases, such as Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease, highlighting their potential as therapeutic targets. Furthermore, recent investigations have implicated mitofilins in the regulation of cellular metabolism and the cellular response to stress. Given their pivotal roles in mitochondrial homeostasis, further research on mitofilins may provide insights into the pathogenesis of mitochondrial disorders and offer novel avenues for therapeutic intervention.
