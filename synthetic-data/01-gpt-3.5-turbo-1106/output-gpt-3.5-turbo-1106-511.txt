prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: PDGF-AA-receptor alpha. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The PDGF-AA-receptor alpha complex has been identified as a key player in the progression of vascular diseases, including atherosclerosis and restenosis. The binding of PDGF-AA ligand to the receptor alpha subunit triggers a cascade of signaling events, leading to the activation of downstream pathways involved in cell proliferation and migration. Aberrant activation of this complex has been implicated in the pathogenesis of several vascular disorders, making it an attractive target for therapeutic interventions. Furthermore, dysregulated PDGF-AA-receptor alpha signaling has been associated with the development of various cancers, highlighting the potential of this complex as a promising biomarker and therapeutic target in oncology. Further research into the precise mechanisms underlying the function of the PDGF-AA-receptor alpha complex is warranted to unravel its therapeutic potential in the treatment of cardiovascular diseases and cancer.
