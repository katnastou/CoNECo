prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: small-subunit processomes. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we investigated the role of small-subunit processomes in the regulation of ribosome biogenesis. Small-subunit processomes are known to play a crucial role in the processing of precursor ribosomal RNA (pre-rRNA) in eukaryotic cells. Our findings demonstrate that chemical inhibition of small-subunit processomes resulted in a significant reduction in mature ribosomal subunit levels, leading to impaired protein synthesis in both yeast and mammalian cells. Furthermore, we observed a correlation between the dysregulation of small-subunit processomes and the development of ribosomopathies, suggesting a potential link between small-subunit processomes and the pathogenesis of these disorders. Overall, our study provides insights into the importance of small-subunit processomes in ribosome biogenesis and their potential implications in human diseases.
