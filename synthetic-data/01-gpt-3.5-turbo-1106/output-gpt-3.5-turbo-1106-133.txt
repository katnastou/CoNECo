prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: DiaA. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The expression of the DiaA protein complex has been shown to play a critical role in regulating the cell cycle and cell division in various bacterial species. Recent studies have revealed that the interaction between DiaA and key regulatory proteins influences the timing and coordination of DNA replication and segregation. Furthermore, perturbations in DiaA expression levels have been linked to aberrant cell division, leading to the formation of anucleate or multi-nucleate cells in bacterial populations. Understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying the function of DiaA holds promise for the development of novel antimicrobial strategies targeting the cell division process. Additionally, elucidating the regulation of DiaA could provide insights into the pathogenesis of certain bacterial infections and inform the development of targeted therapeutic interventions.
