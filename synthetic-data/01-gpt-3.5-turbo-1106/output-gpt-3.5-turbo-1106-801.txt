prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: CUE1-UBC7 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (E2). Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The CUE1-UBC7 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (E2) complex plays a crucial role in the ubiquitination process, which is essential for the degradation of marked proteins by the proteasome. Previous studies have implicated this complex in the regulation of various cellular processes, including cell cycle progression, DNA repair, and apoptosis. Dysregulation of the ubiquitin-proteasome system has been linked to the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease. Moreover, aberrant ubiquitination has also been observed in various types of cancer, highlighting the importance of understanding the molecular mechanisms governing the activity of the CUE1-UBC7 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (E2) complex in both normal and disease states. Further investigation into the functional significance of this complex may pave the way for the development of novel therapeutic strategies targeting the ubiquitin-proteasome system.
