prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: outer kinetochores. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The outer kinetochores, a vital protein complex that plays a crucial role in the segregation of chromosomes during cell division, have been the subject of intense research due to their implications in various human diseases, including cancer and developmental disorders. Recent studies have focused on the regulatory mechanisms that govern the assembly and function of the outer kinetochores, shedding light on the intricate interplay between kinetochore proteins and spindle microtubules. Furthermore, the identification of small molecule inhibitors targeting the outer kinetochores has provided promising avenues for the development of novel therapeutic strategies for conditions characterized by aberrant chromosome segregation, offering potential implications for cancer treatment and prenatal diagnosis.
