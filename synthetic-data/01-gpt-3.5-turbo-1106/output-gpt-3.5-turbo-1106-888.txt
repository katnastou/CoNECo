prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: HEX S. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: This study aimed to investigate the role of the HEX S protein complex in the pathogenesis of osteoarthritis. Utilizing a murine model, we observed a significant upregulation of HEX S expression in articular cartilage samples obtained from osteoarthritic mice compared to healthy controls. Furthermore, our analysis revealed a positive correlation between HEX S levels and the severity of cartilage degradation, as assessed by histological and radiographic scoring. In addition, immunohistochemical staining demonstrated co-localization of HEX S with inflammatory markers in the affected cartilage. These findings suggest a potential involvement of HEX S in the progression of osteoarthritis and underscore the need for further investigation into the molecular mechanisms underlying its pathogenic role.
