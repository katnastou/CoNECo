prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: mitochondrial contact site and cristae organizing system. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The mitochondrial contact site and cristae organizing system (MICOS) is a protein complex essential for maintaining the structure and function of the mitochondrial inner membrane. Disruption of MICOS has been implicated in various human diseases, including mitochondrial encephalopathy and neurodegenerative disorders. Recent studies have identified several key interacting proteins and small molecules that regulate the assembly and stability of the MICOS complex. Furthermore, the role of MICOS in mediating mitochondrial dynamics and bioenergetics has provided new insights into the pathogenesis of metabolic diseases. Understanding the molecular mechanisms governing MICOS function may offer potential therapeutic targets for the treatment of mitochondrial disorders.
