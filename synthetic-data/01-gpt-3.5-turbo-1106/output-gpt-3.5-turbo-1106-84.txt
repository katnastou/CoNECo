prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: PTEX. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The Plasmodium Translocon of Exported Proteins (PTEX) is a crucial protein complex involved in the export of effector proteins to the host erythrocyte in Plasmodium falciparum, the causative agent of malaria. The PTEX complex is composed of multiple subunits, including PTEX150, EXP2, HSP101, and PTEX88. Recent studies have indicated the essential role of PTEX in the pathogenesis of severe malaria, including cerebral malaria and severe anemia. Disruption of the PTEX complex has been shown to impede the export of virulence factors, leading to reduced parasite survival within the host. Therefore, understanding the mechanisms regulating PTEX function and identifying potential therapeutic targets within this complex could offer valuable insights for the development of novel antimalarial strategies.
