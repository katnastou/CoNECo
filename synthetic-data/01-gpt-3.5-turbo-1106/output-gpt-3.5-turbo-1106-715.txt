prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: eIF-3. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we aimed to evaluate the role of the eIF-3 protein complex in the progression of breast cancer. Our results demonstrated that the expression levels of eIF-3 were significantly increased in breast cancer tissues compared to adjacent normal tissues. Furthermore, our findings revealed a positive correlation between eIF-3 expression and tumor size, lymph node involvement, and histological grade. Additionally, our in vitro experiments indicated that inhibition of eIF-3 resulted in decreased proliferation and increased apoptosis of breast cancer cells. Taken together, these results suggest that eIF-3 may play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of breast cancer, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target for this disease.
