prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: nucleotide-excision repair factor 1. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: Our study investigated the potential role of nucleotide-excision repair factor 1 (NERF1) in the pathogenesis of xeroderma pigmentosum, a rare genetic disorder characterized by extreme sensitivity to ultraviolet (UV) radiation and an elevated risk of skin cancer. Using a combination of cellular and animal models, we demonstrated that NERF1 deficiency significantly impaired the repair of UV-induced DNA damage, leading to increased genomic instability and susceptibility to tumorigenesis. Furthermore, we identified a small molecule inhibitor of NERF1 that effectively disrupted the function of this protein complex, resulting in enhanced sensitivity of xeroderma pigmentosum cells to UV radiation. Our findings highlight the potential of targeting NERF1 as a novel therapeutic strategy for the management of UV-induced skin cancers in individuals with xeroderma pigmentosum.
