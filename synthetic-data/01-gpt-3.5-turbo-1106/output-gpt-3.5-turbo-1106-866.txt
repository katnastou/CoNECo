prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: CGRP-R. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: Recent studies have demonstrated the pivotal role of the calcitonin gene-related peptide receptor (CGRP-R) in the pathophysiology of migraine. The CGRP-R has garnered increasing attention as a potential therapeutic target for the management of migraine, a prevalent neurological disorder characterized by severe headache and often accompanied by nausea, vomiting, and sensitivity to light and sound. Several small molecule antagonists and monoclonal antibodies targeting CGRP-R have shown promising results in clinical trials, leading to their approval for the prophylactic treatment of migraine. Furthermore, the CGRP-R signaling pathway has been implicated in the regulation of vascular tone and inflammatory processes, suggesting its potential relevance in cardiovascular and immune disorders. The growing understanding of CGRP-R function and its involvement in various biological processes may provide novel insights into the development of therapeutic interventions for migraine and other related conditions.
