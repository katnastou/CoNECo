prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: replisome. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: A critical aspect of DNA replication is the assembly and function of the replisome, a multi-subunit protein complex responsible for coordinating the synthesis of leading and lagging DNA strands during the S phase of the cell cycle. Dysfunction of the replisome has been implicated in genomic instability and increased susceptibility to various genetic disorders, including cancer. Recent studies have highlighted the role of specific enzymatic activities and protein-protein interactions within the replisome in maintaining the fidelity and efficiency of DNA replication. Furthermore, the interplay between replisome components and regulatory factors, such as cyclin-dependent kinases, has emerged as a vital determinant of replication dynamics and genomic integrity. Elucidating the molecular mechanisms underlying replisome function holds promise for uncovering novel therapeutic targets for diseases associated with aberrant DNA replication.
