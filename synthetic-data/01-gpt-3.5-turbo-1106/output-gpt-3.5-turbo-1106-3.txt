prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: Oligopeptide ABC transporters. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In the present study, we investigated the role of Oligopeptide ABC transporters in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Through analysis of intestinal tissue samples from patients with IBD and healthy controls, we observed a significant upregulation of Oligopeptide ABC transporters in the inflamed mucosa. Furthermore, using a murine model of IBD, we demonstrated that genetic ablation of Oligopeptide ABC transporters resulted in reduced inflammation and improved overall disease outcomes. Our findings suggest that Oligopeptide ABC transporters may play a critical role in the aberrant immune response observed in IBD, and their modulation could represent a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of this debilitating condition.
