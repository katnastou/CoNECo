prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: collagen type VI trimer. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we investigate the role of the collagen type VI trimer in the pathogenesis of muscular dystrophy. Using a mouse model of Duchenne muscular dystrophy, we observed a significant decrease in the expression of collagen type VI trimer in the skeletal muscle tissue. Furthermore, our data revealed a correlation between the level of collagen type VI trimer and the severity of muscle fibrosis in diseased animals. We also observed an altered interaction between collagen type VI trimer and extracellular matrix components in dystrophic muscle, indicating a potential mechanism for the pathological progression of the disease. Collectively, these findings highlight the importance of collagen type VI trimer in maintaining muscle integrity and suggest it may serve as a potential therapeutic target for Duchenne muscular dystrophy.
