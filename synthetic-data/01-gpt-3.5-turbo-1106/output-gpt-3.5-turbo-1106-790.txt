prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: GMPR1. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: Recent studies have implicated the guanosine monophosphate reductase 1 (GMPR1) protein complex in the regulation of purine nucleotide biosynthesis. The complex, composed of GMPR1 subunits, plays a critical role in the conversion of GMP to IMP, a key step in the de novo synthesis of guanine nucleotides. Dysregulation of this process has been linked to various human diseases, including gout and acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Furthermore, GMPR1 has been found to interact with other key enzymes in the purine biosynthetic pathway, highlighting its central role in maintaining cellular nucleotide homeostasis. Understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying GMPR1 function may provide insights into the pathogenesis of these diseases and offer potential therapeutic targets for intervention.
