prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: MPP. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we investigated the role of the mitochondrial processing peptidase (MPP) in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease. We utilized a transgenic mouse model overexpressing amyloid-β protein to examine the effects of MPP inhibition on cognitive decline and neurodegeneration. Our results demonstrated that pharmacological inhibition of MPP with a specific small molecule inhibitor led to a reduction in amyloid-β accumulation and a significant improvement in cognitive function in the mice. Furthermore, histological analysis revealed a decrease in amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles in the brains of treated animals. Our findings suggest that targeting MPP may offer a promising therapeutic strategy for Alzheimer's disease by modulating amyloid-β metabolism and mitigating neurotoxicity.
