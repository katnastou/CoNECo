prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: NADH:plastoquinone reductase. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we explored the role of the NADH:plastoquinone reductase protein complex in the development of oxidative stress in Parkinson's disease models. Through in vitro experiments, we demonstrated that the activity of NADH:plastoquinone reductase was downregulated in response to neurotoxic insult, leading to impaired electron transport and increased generation of reactive oxygen species. Using a variety of biochemical and cell biology techniques, we elucidated the mechanism by which NADH:plastoquinone reductase dysfunction contributes to the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease. These findings provide valuable insights into the molecular underpinnings of oxidative stress in neurodegenerative disorders and suggest that targeting NADH:plastoquinone reductase may represent a novel therapeutic strategy for mitigating oxidative damage in Parkinson's disease.
