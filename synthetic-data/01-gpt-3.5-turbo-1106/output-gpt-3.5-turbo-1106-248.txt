prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: glycine-gated chloride channels. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The glycine-gated chloride channels are integral to the inhibitory neurotransmission in the central nervous system. These ligand-gated ion channels are essential for the hyperpolarization of neurons and play a crucial role in maintaining the balance between excitation and inhibition. Dysfunction of glycine-gated chloride channels has been implicated in a range of neurological disorders, including hyperekplexia and epilepsy. Recent studies have illuminated the molecular mechanisms underlying the function and regulation of these channels, providing insights into potential therapeutic targets for the treatment of these debilitating conditions. Furthermore, the pharmacological modulation of glycine-gated chloride channels has emerged as a promising avenue for novel drug development in the field of neuropharmacology.
