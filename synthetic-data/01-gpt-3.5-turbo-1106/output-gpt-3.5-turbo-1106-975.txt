prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: Cis-IPTase. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The Cis-IPTase protein complex has recently been implicated in the regulation of cytokinin biosynthesis in Arabidopsis thaliana. Cis-IPTase activity is crucial for mediating the synthesis of cis-zeatin, a cytokinin involved in various developmental and physiological processes in plants. Previous studies have highlighted the role of Cis-IPTase in controlling root growth and senescence, indicating its significance in plant growth and development. Moreover, the dysregulation of cytokinin biosynthesis has been associated with pathogenic responses and stress tolerance in plants, suggesting a potential link between Cis-IPTase and disease resistance. Understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying Cis-IPTase function may offer new insights into the manipulation of cytokinin levels for agricultural purposes, as well as provide opportunities for enhancing plant resilience to environmental stresses.
