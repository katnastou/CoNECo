model: gpt-3.5-turbo-1106
prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: Kinetochore CCAN. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The Kinetochore CCAN complex plays a crucial role in coordinating the attachment of microtubules to chromosomes during mitosis, ensuring proper segregation of genetic material. Recent studies have implicated dysregulation of the Kinetochore CCAN complex in the pathogenesis of various human malignancies, including colorectal cancer and leukemia. Furthermore, it has been demonstrated that perturbation of the Kinetochore CCAN complex leads to aberrant chromosome segregation, spindle assembly defects, and aneuploidy, contributing to the development of genetic diseases such as Down syndrome and Edwards syndrome. Given its central role in cell division and genomic stability, understanding the molecular mechanisms governing the assembly and regulation of the Kinetochore CCAN complex is of paramount importance for the development of targeted therapies aimed at mitigating the impact of its dysfunction in disease states.
