prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: cullin-RING ligase 7. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: Cullin-RING ligase 7 (CRL7) has recently emerged as a critical regulator of cellular processes and disease pathogenesis. This protein complex has been implicated in the ubiquitination and subsequent degradation of key substrates involved in pathways such as cell cycle control, DNA repair, and signal transduction. Dysregulation of CRL7 has been associated with various pathologies, including cancer, neurodegenerative diseases, and metabolic disorders. Small molecule inhibitors targeting CRL7 have shown promising results in preclinical studies, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target for intervention in a wide range of human diseases. Further investigation into the specific substrates and biological functions of CRL7 is warranted to unlock its full therapeutic potential and gain a deeper understanding of its role in human health and disease.
