prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: precatalytic spliceosome. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In recent years, a growing body of research has focused on elucidating the role of the precatalytic spliceosome in the processing of pre-mRNA transcripts. This multi-subunit ribonucleoprotein complex plays a crucial role in the splicing of introns and the production of mature mRNA molecules in eukaryotic cells. Dysregulation or malfunction of the precatalytic spliceosome has been implicated in a range of human diseases, including various genetic disorders and cancers. Therefore, understanding the molecular mechanisms governing the assembly and function of this complex is of critical importance for the development of targeted therapeutics and diagnostic approaches. Current studies are aimed at deciphering the intricate interplay between the precatalytic spliceosome and its associated factors, as well as its potential as a novel target for intervention strategies.
