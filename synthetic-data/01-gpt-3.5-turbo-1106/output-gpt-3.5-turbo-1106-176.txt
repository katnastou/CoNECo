prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: NADPH-sulfite reductase. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The NADPH-sulfite reductase (NSR) complex is a vital enzyme involved in sulfur assimilation in a wide range of organisms. In recent years, there has been a growing interest in understanding the intricate regulatory mechanisms that govern NSR activity and its role in maintaining cellular redox homeostasis. Numerous studies have demonstrated the significance of NSR in protecting cells from oxidative damage and in mitigating the impact of sulfur metabolism dysregulation on various human diseases, such as neurodevelopmental disorders and cardiovascular conditions. Further investigations into the molecular interactions and structural features of NSR promise to shed light on its potential as a therapeutic target for managing pathologies associated with sulfur metabolism dysfunction.
