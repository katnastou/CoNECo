prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: FtsBL. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: Recent studies have implicated the FtsBL protein complex in the regulation of cell division in bacterial species. FtsBL has been shown to interact closely with peptidoglycan and lipid II, providing essential support for the structural integrity and division of bacterial cells. Disruption of the FtsBL complex has been found to lead to aberrant cell morphology and impaired cell division, resulting in hindered growth and survival of bacteria. Further research is warranted to elucidate the precise role of FtsBL in the context of bacterial cell division and to explore the therapeutic potential of targeting this protein complex for the treatment of bacterial infections.
