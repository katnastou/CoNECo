prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: HTL. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we investigated the role of the HTL protein complex in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular diseases. Previous research has implicated the HTL complex in regulating angiogenesis and vascular homeostasis. To elucidate its potential involvement in the development of atherosclerosis, we analyzed the expression levels of HTL in a mouse model of the disease. Our findings revealed a significant upregulation of HTL in atherosclerotic lesions, suggesting a potential association with disease progression. Furthermore, we observed an increased interaction between HTL and specific signaling molecules known to be implicated in vascular inflammation. These results provide novel insights into the functions of the HTL complex in cardiovascular pathology and warrant further investigation into its potential as a therapeutic target for atherosclerosis.
