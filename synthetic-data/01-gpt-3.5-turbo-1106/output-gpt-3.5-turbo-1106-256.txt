prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: surface IgG2b. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we investigated the role of the surface IgG2b protein complex in the progression of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) using a murine model. We observed a significant upregulation of surface IgG2b expression in the B cells of SLE-afflicted mice compared to healthy controls. Additionally, treatment with a specific monoclonal antibody targeting surface IgG2b resulted in a reduction of autoantibody production and ameliorated kidney damage in the SLE mice. Our findings suggest that surface IgG2b may play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of SLE, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target for mitigating disease progression. This study sheds light on the contribution of surface IgG2b to the dysregulated immune response characteristic of SLE and provides a basis for further exploration of its mechanistic involvement in autoimmune diseases.
