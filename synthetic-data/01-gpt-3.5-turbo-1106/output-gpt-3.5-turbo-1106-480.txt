prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: succinic dehydrogenases. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we investigated the role of succinic dehydrogenases in the development of mitochondrial dysfunction in a mouse model of heart failure. We found that the expression of succinic dehydrogenases was significantly decreased in the failing hearts compared to healthy controls. Furthermore, we observed a significant increase in reactive oxygen species levels and a decrease in ATP production in the failing hearts, indicating impaired mitochondrial function. These findings suggest that succinic dehydrogenases may play a key role in maintaining mitochondrial function and energy production in the context of heart failure. Understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying succinic dehydrogenases dysregulation could provide novel insights into the pathogenesis of heart failure and potential therapeutic targets for mitigating mitochondrial dysfunction in this disease.
