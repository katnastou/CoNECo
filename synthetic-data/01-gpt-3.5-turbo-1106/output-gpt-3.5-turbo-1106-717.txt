prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: MINOS. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The mitochondrial inner membrane organizing system (MINOS) is a highly conserved protein complex that plays a crucial role in the maintenance of mitochondrial integrity and function. Recent studies have implicated MINOS in the regulation of mitochondrial morphology, cristae organization, and protein import. Dysregulation of MINOS has been associated with various human diseases, including neurodegenerative disorders and metabolic syndromes. Furthermore, the importance of MINOS in orchestrating mitochondrial quality control processes has garnered significant interest in the field of mitochondrial biology. Elucidating the molecular mechanisms underlying MINOS function may provide novel insights into the pathogenesis of mitochondrial disorders and offer potential targets for therapeutic intervention. Hence, further research into the intricate roles of MINOS in mitochondrial homeostasis is warranted to advance our understanding of mitochondrial dysfunction-related diseases and to identify potential avenues for therapeutic development.
