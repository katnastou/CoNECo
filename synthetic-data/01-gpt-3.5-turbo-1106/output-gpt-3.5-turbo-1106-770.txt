prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: PSI associated light-harvesting complex I. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we investigated the role of the PSI associated light-harvesting complex I (PSI-LHCI) in the photosynthetic machinery of Arabidopsis thaliana. We observed that mutants lacking functional PSI-LHCI exhibited reduced photosynthetic efficiency and increased susceptibility to photoinhibition under high light conditions. Furthermore, our results demonstrated that PSI-LHCI is essential for the efficient transfer of excitation energy to the photosystem I reaction center and contributes to the overall stability of the photosynthetic apparatus. Our findings suggest that PSI-LHCI plays a crucial role in optimizing the light harvesting and energy transfer processes in plants, highlighting its potential importance for improving crop productivity and resilience to environmental stresses.
