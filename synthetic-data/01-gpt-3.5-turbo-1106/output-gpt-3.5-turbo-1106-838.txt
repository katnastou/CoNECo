prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: FA core. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The FA core is a crucial protein complex involved in the maintenance of genomic stability and the repair of DNA damage. Dysfunction of the FA core has been implicated in the pathogenesis of Fanconi anemia, a rare genetic disorder characterized by bone marrow failure, developmental abnormalities, and an increased risk of cancer. Various studies have highlighted the role of the FA core in mediating the cellular response to interstrand crosslinks induced by certain chemotherapeutic agents, providing insight into potential therapeutic strategies for enhancing cancer treatment efficacy. Understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying the functioning of the FA core will not only improve our knowledge of DNA repair processes but also offer potential avenues for the development of targeted therapies for Fanconi anemia and related malignancies.
