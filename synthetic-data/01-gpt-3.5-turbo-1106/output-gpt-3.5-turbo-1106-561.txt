prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: DISC. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The study aimed to investigate the role of the Death-Inducing Signaling Complex (DISC) in the regulation of apoptosis in pancreatic cancer. The analysis involved examining the impact of DISC on the downstream signaling pathway involving caspases and Tumor Necrosis Factor (TNF)-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) in pancreatic cancer cell lines. Furthermore, the study explored the potential therapeutic targeting of DISC using small molecules and their effects on cell viability and apoptosis induction. The findings revealed a crucial involvement of DISC in the apoptotic response of pancreatic cancer cells, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target for the treatment of pancreatic cancer. This research provides valuable insights for the development of novel treatment strategies aimed at modulating the DISC-mediated apoptosis pathway in pancreatic cancer.
