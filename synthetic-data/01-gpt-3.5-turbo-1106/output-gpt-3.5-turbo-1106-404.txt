prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: fatty acid elongase. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: Recent research has demonstrated the pivotal role of the fatty acid elongase complex in regulating lipid metabolism and its association with various metabolic disorders, such as obesity and type 2 diabetes. Fatty acid elongase, an essential enzyme complex in fatty acid biosynthesis, is involved in the elongation of long-chain fatty acids, thus influencing membrane composition and regulating cellular signaling pathways. Dysregulation of the fatty acid elongase complex has been linked to aberrant lipid profiles and altered lipid homeostasis in metabolic diseases. Furthermore, studies have highlighted the potential therapeutic implications of targeting this complex in mitigating metabolic syndrome and its associated complications. Understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying the function of the fatty acid elongase complex is crucial for developing novel therapeutic strategies for managing metabolic disorders and improving overall health outcomes.
