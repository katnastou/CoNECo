prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: CoaC. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we investigated the role of the CoaC protein complex in regulating the biosynthesis of coenzyme A (CoA) in Escherichia coli. Our results demonstrated that the CoaC complex is crucial for the proper assembly and function of the CoA biosynthetic pathway. Furthermore, we found that disruption of the CoaC complex led to a significant decrease in cellular CoA levels, impacting essential metabolic processes such as fatty acid synthesis and citric acid cycle. These findings suggest that the CoaC complex plays a critical role in maintaining cellular CoA homeostasis and may serve as a potential target for the development of novel antibacterial agents. Our study sheds light on the importance of the CoaC complex in bacterial metabolism and provides insights into potential therapeutic strategies for combating CoA-related metabolic disorders.
