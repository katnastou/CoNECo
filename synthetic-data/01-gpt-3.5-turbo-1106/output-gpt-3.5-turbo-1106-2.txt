prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: delta DNA polymerases. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In recent years, the role of delta DNA polymerases in DNA replication and repair has garnered increasing attention among researchers. Studies have demonstrated the significance of these protein complexes in maintaining genomic stability and fidelity. Mutations in genes encoding delta DNA polymerases have been associated with various hereditary disorders, including certain types of cancer and neurodegenerative diseases. Moreover, the interaction of delta DNA polymerases with specific small molecule inhibitors has emerged as a potential target for therapeutic interventions. Understanding the intricate regulatory mechanisms of these protein complexes may provide valuable insights into the development of novel treatments for diseases linked to DNA replication and repair deficiencies.
