prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: Prothrombinase. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: Prothrombinase, a crucial enzyme complex composed of coagulation factors Va and Xa, plays a pivotal role in the blood coagulation cascade. Upon activation, prothrombinase catalyzes the conversion of prothrombin to thrombin, leading to the formation of a fibrin clot. Dysregulation of prothrombinase activity has been linked to various thrombotic conditions, including deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, and myocardial infarction. Targeting the prothrombinase complex has emerged as a promising therapeutic strategy for managing thrombotic disorders. This research seeks to further elucidate the molecular mechanisms governing the assembly and function of prothrombinase and to explore potential inhibitors with clinical relevance for the treatment and prevention of thrombosis.
