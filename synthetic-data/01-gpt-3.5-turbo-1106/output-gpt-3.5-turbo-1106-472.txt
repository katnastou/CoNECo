prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: 4-amino-4-deoxychorismate synthase. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, the role of the 4-amino-4-deoxychorismate synthase (ADC synthase) protein complex in the biosynthesis of p-aminobenzoic acid (PABA) was investigated. PABA is a key precursor in the folate biosynthetic pathway, essential for nucleotide and amino acid synthesis in a variety of organisms, including bacteria and plants. Through structural and functional analysis, we identified a conserved residue crucial for the catalytic activity of 4-amino-4-deoxychorismate synthase. Furthermore, through a series of mutation experiments, we delineated the impact of this residue on the enzymatic function of 4-amino-4-deoxychorismate synthase. Our findings provide valuable insights into the catalytic mechanism of the ADC synthase complex and shed light on potential targets for the development of novel antimicrobial agents aimed at disrupting the folate biosynthetic pathway.
