prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: Toc. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The Toc protein complex is integral to the import of nuclear-encoded proteins into chloroplasts in plants. Its role in protein translocation across the chloroplast envelope membrane is crucial for maintaining proper chloroplast function and, by extension, plant growth and development. The binding of preproteins to the Toc receptor complex at the outer membrane initiates a series of translocation events orchestrated by various auxiliary proteins, ultimately leading to the delivery of imported proteins into the chloroplast stroma. Dysregulation of Toc complex activity has been associated with impaired chloroplast protein import and subsequent deficiencies in photosynthetic pathways, posing a significant threat to the overall health and yield of agricultural crops. Understanding the molecular mechanisms governing the function of the Toc protein complex and identifying potential modulators of its activity may hold promising implications for improving crop resilience and productivity in the face of environmental stresses and diseases.
