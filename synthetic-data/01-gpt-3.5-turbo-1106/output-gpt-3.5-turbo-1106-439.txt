prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: Sec6/8. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In recent years, the Sec6/8 protein complex has emerged as a critical regulator of intracellular protein trafficking in eukaryotic cells. This complex plays a pivotal role in the assembly and targeting of vesicles carrying cargo proteins from the endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi apparatus. Notably, disruption of the Sec6/8 complex has been associated with aberrant vesicular transport and has been implicated in several human diseases, including various forms of neurodegenerative disorders and certain types of cancer. Given its central importance in cellular homeostasis, further elucidation of the molecular mechanisms governing the function and regulation of the Sec6/8 complex holds great promise for the development of novel therapeutic strategies aimed at mitigating disease pathology.
