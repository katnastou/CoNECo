prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: peroxisomal import pore. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The peroxisomal import pore, a crucial protein complex in the import of proteins into peroxisomes, has been the subject of extensive study in recent years. Understanding the mechanisms by which the peroxisomal import pore facilitates the import of proteins is of great significance in elucidating the molecular basis of peroxisomal biogenesis and function. Dysregulation of peroxisomal import pore function has been implicated in various human diseases, including peroxisomal disorders such as Zellweger syndrome. Additionally, the peroxisomal import pore is known to interact with several cytosolic and peroxisomal proteins, highlighting its role in the coordination of protein import and sorting processes within the cell. Further investigations into the structure and function of the peroxisomal import pore are essential for gaining insights into peroxisomal biology and the development of potential therapeutic interventions for peroxisomal disorders.
