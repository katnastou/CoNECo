prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: MIB. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The MIB protein complex has garnered great interest in the field of cell biology due to its critical role in regulating crucial cellular processes such as Notch signaling and endosomal trafficking. Recent studies have elucidated the intricate interplay between MIB and various E3 ubiquitin ligases, shedding light on its involvement in maintaining cellular homeostasis. Furthermore, aberrant MIB activity has been implicated in the pathogenesis of several diseases, including certain cancers and neurodegenerative disorders. The development of small molecule inhibitors targeting MIB holds promise for therapeutic interventions, making it a potential pharmacological target for a range of medical conditions. This burgeoning understanding of MIB's multifaceted functions underscores its significance in the realm of biomedical research and its potential for clinical applications in the future.
