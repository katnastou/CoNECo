prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: SufA. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The SufA protein complex has been implicated in various cellular processes, particularly in maintaining the balance of iron-sulfur clusters in organisms. This intricate multi-subunit system is known to play a critical role in the biogenesis of iron-sulfur clusters, which are essential cofactors for a wide array of proteins involved in fundamental cellular functions. Dysfunction of the SufA complex has been associated with aberrant iron homeostasis and has been linked to the development of certain diseases, including neurodegenerative disorders and mitochondrial dysfunction. Understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying the regulation and function of the SufA complex is crucial for unraveling the pathophysiology of these diseases and may pave the way for the development of novel therapeutic interventions targeting iron-sulfur cluster biogenesis.
