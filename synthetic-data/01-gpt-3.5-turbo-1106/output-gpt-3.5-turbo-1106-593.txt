prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: polymerase alpha-primase. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In recent years, the role of polymerase alpha-primase (PAP) in DNA replication has garnered much attention in the field of molecular biology. PAP, a complex composed of the catalytic subunit of DNA polymerase alpha and the primase subunit, plays a crucial role in the initiation of DNA synthesis. The function of PAP in the coordination of Okazaki fragment synthesis during lagging strand DNA replication has been well documented. It has been observed that dysregulation or mutation of PAP is associated with various genetic disorders and malignancies. Furthermore, the intricate interplay between PAP and the DNA damage response pathway has been the focus of recent investigations, shedding light on potential therapeutic strategies for diseases such as cancer. Advances in understanding the biochemical and structural properties of PAP have provided valuable insights into its mechanistic role in DNA replication and repair, with important implications for the development of novel pharmacological interventions.
