prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: plasma membrane signaling receptor. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In recent years, the plasma membrane signaling receptor complex has emerged as a key mediator of cellular communication in pathophysiological processes. This complex plays a pivotal role in transducing extracellular signals into intracellular responses, thereby regulating diverse cellular functions. Dysregulation of the plasma membrane signaling receptor complex has been implicated in various disease states, including cancer, autoimmune disorders, and cardiovascular diseases. Furthermore, studies have demonstrated the involvement of this complex in mediating responses to pharmacological agents and environmental stimuli. Given its significance in diverse physiological and pathological contexts, elucidating the molecular mechanisms governing the functioning of the plasma membrane signaling receptor complex holds promise for the development of innovative therapeutic strategies targeting a plethora of human maladies.
