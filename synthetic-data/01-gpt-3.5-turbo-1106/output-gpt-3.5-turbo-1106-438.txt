prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: kainate selective glutamate receptors. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In recent years, the kainate selective glutamate receptors have gained attention as potential targets for therapeutic intervention in neurodegenerative disorders. These ionotropic receptors have been implicated in the pathophysiology of various neurological conditions, including epilepsy and schizophrenia. The unique characteristics of the kainate selective glutamate receptors make them an attractive focus for drug development efforts aimed at modulating excitatory neurotransmission. Additionally, their differential expression and distribution in various regions of the central nervous system suggest a potential role in synaptic plasticity and learning. Despite these promising aspects, further investigation is needed to elucidate the precise mechanisms of action and the potential therapeutic implications of targeting kainate selective glutamate receptors in neurodegenerative diseases.
