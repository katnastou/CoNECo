prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: membrane coat. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In recent years, the membrane coat protein complex has been studied extensively due to its critical role in intracellular trafficking and vesicle formation. This complex is involved in maintaining the structural integrity of the cell membrane and facilitating the transport of important molecules within the cell. Research has shown that dysregulation of the membrane coat complex is associated with various human diseases, including certain neurodegenerative disorders and infectious diseases. Furthermore, the interaction of specific chemical compounds with the membrane coat complex has been investigated as a potential therapeutic target for these conditions. Understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying the function of the membrane coat protein complex holds great promise for the development of novel therapeutic interventions targeting cellular trafficking pathways.
