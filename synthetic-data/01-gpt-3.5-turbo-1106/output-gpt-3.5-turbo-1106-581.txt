prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: Fc-gamma receptor I. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we aimed to investigate the role of Fc-gamma receptor I in the pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis. Using a cohort of patients with rheumatoid arthritis and healthy controls, we evaluated the expression levels of Fc-gamma receptor I in peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Our results demonstrated a significant upregulation of Fc-gamma receptor I in rheumatoid arthritis patients compared to healthy controls. Additionally, we observed a positive correlation between Fc-gamma receptor I expression and disease severity, as measured by clinical assessment scores. Furthermore, we found that treatment with a specific small molecule inhibitor targeting Fc-gamma receptor I led to a reduction in pro-inflammatory cytokine production in vitro. These findings highlight the potential of targeting Fc-gamma receptor I as a therapeutic strategy for rheumatoid arthritis.
