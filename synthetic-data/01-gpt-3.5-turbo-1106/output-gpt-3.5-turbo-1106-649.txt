prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: tripartite ATP-independent periplasmic transporters. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In recent years, the role of tripartite ATP-independent periplasmic transporters (TAT) in bacterial virulence has garnered attention in biomedical research. These transporters are critical for the secretion of virulence factors across the bacterial cytoplasmic membrane, and their activity has been implicated in the pathogenesis of various infectious diseases. The interaction of TAT transporters with various substrates, such as toxins and enzymes, has sparked interest in understanding their precise mechanism of action and potential as targets for novel antimicrobial strategies. Furthermore, the structural and functional characteristics of TAT transporters have provided insights into the evolution of bacterial pathogenicity and the development of potential therapeutic interventions. Further studies elucidating the role of TAT transporters in the context of specific infectious agents and their pathogenicity may yield valuable insights for the development of novel treatment strategies against these menacing pathogens.
