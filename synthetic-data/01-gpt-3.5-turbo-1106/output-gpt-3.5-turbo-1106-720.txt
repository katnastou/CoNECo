prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: voltage-gated calcium channel. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: Voltage-gated calcium channels (VGCCs) are essential proteins involved in numerous physiological processes in various cell types. These channels play a vital role in mediating calcium ion influx into excitable cells and are crucial for neurotransmitter release, muscle contraction, and gene expression. Dysregulation of VGCC function has been implicated in a wide array of diseases, including epilepsy, Parkinson's disease, and cardiac arrhythmias. Additionally, VGCCs are the target of several pharmacological agents used to treat conditions such as hypertension and chronic pain. Given their pivotal roles in health and disease, understanding the regulation and function of voltage-gated calcium channels holds promise for the development of novel therapeutic interventions.
