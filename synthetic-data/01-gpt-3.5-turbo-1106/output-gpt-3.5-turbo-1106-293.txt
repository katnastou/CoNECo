prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: mRNP. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The mRNP protein complex plays a crucial role in post-transcriptional gene regulation by facilitating mRNA processing, transport, and localization within the eukaryotic cells. Dysregulation of mRNP function has been associated with various human diseases, including neurodegenerative disorders, cancer, and developmental abnormalities. Recent studies have revealed the involvement of specific RNA-binding proteins in the assembly and disassembly of mRNP complexes, shedding light on the intricate mechanisms governing mRNA dynamics. Characterizing the molecular interactions within the mRNP complex and understanding its impact on cellular homeostasis is essential for devising potential therapeutic strategies targeting mRNP-associated pathologies. Furthermore, elucidating the precise roles of mRNP in the context of different cell types and developmental stages will advance our knowledge of gene expression regulation and disease pathophysiology.
