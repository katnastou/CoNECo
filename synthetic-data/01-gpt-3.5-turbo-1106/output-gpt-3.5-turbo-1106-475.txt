prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: plastid biotin carboxylase. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we investigated the role of the plastid biotin carboxylase (PBC) protein complex in the regulation of fatty acid metabolism in Arabidopsis thaliana. Through a series of experiments involving mutant strains and chemical inhibitor treatments, we demonstrated the essential function of PBC in the biotin-dependent carboxylation of acetyl-CoA, a key step in fatty acid biosynthesis. Furthermore, we observed a significant decrease in seed oil content in the PBC-deficient Arabidopsis mutants, highlighting the importance of PBC in lipid accumulation. Overall, our findings provide novel insights into the molecular mechanisms governing fatty acid metabolism in plants and highlight the potential of targeting PBC for the development of strategies to modulate lipid accumulation in agricultural crops.
