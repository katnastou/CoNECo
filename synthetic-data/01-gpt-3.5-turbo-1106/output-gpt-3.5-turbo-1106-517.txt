prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: Hrs/STAM. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The Hrs/STAM protein complex has been the subject of intense investigation due to its pivotal roles in various cellular processes, including endosomal sorting and receptor trafficking. The complex is known to interact with key molecular players such as ubiquitin and clathrin, suggesting its involvement in endocytic pathways. Dysregulation of Hrs/STAM has been implicated in various pathological conditions, including cancer and neurodegenerative diseases. Furthermore, small molecule inhibitors targeting the complex have shown promise in preclinical studies for the treatment of certain malignancies. The continued study of Hrs/STAM and its associated pathways holds great promise for the development of novel therapeutic strategies for a range of human diseases.
