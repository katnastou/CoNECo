prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: eukaryotic 43S preinitiation. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: Recent studies have shown significant roles for eukaryotic 43S preinitiation complex in the regulation of translation initiation. This complex is implicated in the control of protein synthesis and its dysregulation has been associated with various human diseases, including cancer and neurodegenerative disorders. The assembly and activity of the 43S preinitiation complex are influenced by various cellular factors, such as mTOR signaling and ribosomal proteins. Additionally, small molecules targeting the regulation of this complex have shown potential for therapeutic intervention in diseases characterized by aberrant translation. Further investigation into the molecular mechanisms governing the function of the eukaryotic 43S preinitiation complex may elucidate novel strategies for the treatment of translation-related diseases.
