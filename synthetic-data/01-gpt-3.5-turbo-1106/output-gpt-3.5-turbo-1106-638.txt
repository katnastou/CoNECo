prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: histone mRNA stem-loop binding. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we investigated the role of the histone mRNA stem-loop binding protein complex in the regulation of gene expression in human cell lines. We utilized a combination of biochemical assays and RNA sequencing to identify the specific interactions between the histone mRNA stem-loop binding complex and its target mRNAs. Our results demonstrate that the histone mRNA stem-loop binding complex plays a critical role in the post-transcriptional regulation of histone gene expression, with potential implications for various diseases involving aberrant histone modification patterns. Furthermore, our findings suggest that targeting the histone mRNA stem-loop binding complex may offer a novel therapeutic strategy for diseases characterized by dysregulated histone expression.
