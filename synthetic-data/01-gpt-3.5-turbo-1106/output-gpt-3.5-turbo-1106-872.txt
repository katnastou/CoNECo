prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: FRG. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we investigated the potential role of the FRG protein complex in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease. Utilizing a transgenic mouse model overexpressing α-synuclein, we observed dysregulation of FRG in the substantia nigra, a key brain region affected in Parkinson's disease. Furthermore, our findings suggest that the dysregulation of FRG may be associated with the accumulation and aggregation of α-synuclein, leading to neuronal dysfunction and degeneration. Importantly, our results provide novel insights into the potential involvement of the FRG protein complex in the pathophysiology of Parkinson's disease, highlighting its importance as a potential therapeutic target for this debilitating neurodegenerative disorder.
