prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: RDC. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In recent years, the role of RDC in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease has garnered significant attention. Previous studies have demonstrated an association between increased levels of RDC and the development of amyloid-beta plaques, a hallmark of Alzheimer's disease pathology. Furthermore, it has been suggested that RDC may modulate the activity of certain kinases involved in tau protein phosphorylation, a critical event in the formation of neurofibrillary tangles. Despite these intriguing findings, the precise molecular mechanisms underlying the involvement of RDC in Alzheimer's disease remain to be fully elucidated. Future investigations exploring the interaction of RDC with other signaling pathways and potential therapeutic interventions targeting RDC are warranted to better understand and potentially mitigate the progression of Alzheimer's disease.
