prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: ribonuclease Ps. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we investigated the potential role of the ribonuclease Ps complex in the progression of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Our analysis focused on the interactions between ribonuclease Ps and inflammatory mediators involved in COPD pathogenesis, such as tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-Î±) and interleukin-8 (IL-8). Using a combination of in vitro and in vivo models, we observed a significant upregulation of ribonuclease Ps expression in lung tissue from COPD patients compared to healthy individuals. Furthermore, we demonstrated that inhibition of ribonuclease Ps activity with a specific inhibitor attenuated the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines in response to cigarette smoke extract. These findings suggest that ribonuclease Ps may play a crucial role in exacerbating COPD-associated inflammation, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target for disease management.
