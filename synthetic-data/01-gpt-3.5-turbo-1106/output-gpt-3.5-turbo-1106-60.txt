prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: GIMC. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we investigated the role of the GIMC complex in regulating cellular responses to oxidative stress. Our results indicate that the GIMC complex interacts with a variety of redox-sensitive signaling pathways, including the Nrf2-Keap1 pathway, to modulate the expression of antioxidant genes such as heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) and NAD(P)H quinone oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1). Furthermore, we observed that disruption of GIMC function resulted in increased susceptibility to oxidative damage and impaired cell viability. These findings suggest that the GIMC complex plays a crucial role in orchestrating cellular defenses against oxidative insults, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target for oxidative stress-related disorders such as neurodegenerative diseases and cancer.
