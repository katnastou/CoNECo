prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: respiratory chain complex IV. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The respiratory chain complex IV, also known as cytochrome c oxidase, is a key component of the mitochondrial electron transport chain and plays a crucial role in cellular respiration. This complex is essential for the final step of electron transfer in the respiratory chain, where it facilitates the transfer of electrons from cytochrome c to molecular oxygen, leading to the formation of water. Dysfunction of respiratory chain complex IV has been implicated in various human diseases, including mitochondrial myopathies and neurodegenerative disorders. Additionally, certain chemical compounds, such as carbon monoxide, can competitively inhibit the activity of this complex, leading to impaired oxidative phosphorylation and energy production. Understanding the structure and function of respiratory chain complex IV is therefore of great importance for the development of therapeutic strategies targeting mitochondrial disorders and related pathologies.
