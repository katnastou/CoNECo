prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: NendoUs. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: Recent studies have highlighted the potential role of the NendoUs protein complex in the progression of neurodegenerative diseases. The NendoUs complex has been shown to interact with amyloid-beta peptides and tau proteins, both of which are key players in Alzheimer's disease pathology. Furthermore, the dysregulation of NendoUs activity has been linked to neuroinflammation and oxidative stress, which are associated with the development of Parkinson's disease. These findings suggest that targeting the NendoUs complex could offer a promising therapeutic approach for mitigating the progression of neurodegenerative disorders. Further investigation into the molecular mechanisms underlying the involvement of NendoUs in these diseases is warranted to elucidate its potential as a therapeutic target.
