prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: alpha-beta TCR. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we investigated the role of the alpha-beta TCR protein complex in the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases. Using a mouse model of rheumatoid arthritis, we observed a significant upregulation of the alpha-beta TCR complex in the synovial tissue of affected joints. Further analysis revealed that T cells expressing the alpha-beta TCR complex exhibited enhanced reactivity to self-antigens, suggesting a potential mechanism for the development of autoimmune responses. Additionally, we found that treatment with a novel small molecule inhibitor of the alpha-beta TCR complex led to a reduction in disease severity and joint inflammation in the mouse model. These findings suggest that targeting the alpha-beta TCR complex may represent a promising therapeutic approach for the management of autoimmune diseases.
