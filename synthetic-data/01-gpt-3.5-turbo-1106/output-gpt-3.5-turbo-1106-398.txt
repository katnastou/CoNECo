prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: dimethyl sulfoxide reductases. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: Dimethyl sulfoxide reductases (DMSOR) are important enzymes involved in the reduction of dimethyl sulfoxide to dimethyl sulfide, a process crucial for the anaerobic respiration of various bacteria and archaea. Recent studies have indicated the potential role of DMSOR in the decomposition of environmental pollutants and in the detoxification of certain chemical compounds. Additionally, the expression levels and activities of DMSOR enzymes have been found to be altered in several human diseases, suggesting a potential link between DMSOR function and disease pathology. Understanding the biochemical and physiological roles of DMSOR in various organisms may provide valuable insights into the potential therapeutic targeting of DMSOR-related pathways in disease management.
