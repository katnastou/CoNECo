prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: IgE B cell receptors. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In recent years, the role of IgE B cell receptors in allergic responses has been a topic of intense investigation. Studies have demonstrated that the binding of antigen to IgE B cell receptors is a key event in the initiation of allergic reactions, leading to the activation of mast cells and the release of inflammatory mediators such as histamine. Furthermore, IgE B cell receptors have been implicated in the pathogenesis of allergic diseases, including asthma, atopic dermatitis, and allergic rhinitis. Understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying the interaction between IgE B cell receptors and antigens holds promise for the development of novel therapeutic interventions aimed at modulating allergic immune responses.
