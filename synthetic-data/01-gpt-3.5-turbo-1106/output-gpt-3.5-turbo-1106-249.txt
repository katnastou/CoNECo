prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: TGF-betal. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we investigated the role of TGF-betal in the pathogenesis of pulmonary fibrosis in a murine model of the disease. We found that administration of bleomycin led to increased expression of TGF-betal in the lung tissue, accompanied by enhanced collagen deposition and fibrotic changes. Furthermore, treatment with a TGF-betal inhibitor attenuated the fibrotic response, leading to improved lung function and reduced mortality in the bleomycin-challenged mice. Our findings highlight the potential therapeutic implications of targeting TGF-betal in the treatment of pulmonary fibrosis and provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying the progression of fibrotic lung diseases.
