prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: AHRC. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The AHRC protein complex is a critical mediator of gene regulation involved in the development and progression of osteosarcoma. Previous studies have demonstrated that the dysregulation of AHRC expression is associated with increased tumor growth and metastasis in osteosarcoma. Here, we investigate the potential therapeutic opportunities for targeting the AHRC complex using small molecule inhibitors. Our findings reveal that the inhibition of AHRC activity results in a significant reduction in tumor cell proliferation and migration, offering a promising strategy for the treatment of osteosarcoma. Furthermore, our results suggest that targeting the AHRC complex may provide a novel approach for overcoming drug resistance in osteosarcoma patients, highlighting the potential clinical significance of this protein complex as a therapeutic target in cancer therapy.
