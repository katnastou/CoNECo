model: gpt-3.5-turbo-1106
prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: TBC. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The TBC protein complex has been a subject of intense investigation in the context of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's. Recent studies have implicated dysregulation of the TBC complex in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease, shedding light on its potential role in modulating intracellular trafficking and protein degradation pathways. Furthermore, the TBC complex has been linked to the regulation of autophagy and proteostasis, suggesting a broader impact on cellular homeostasis. Elucidating the intricate interactions of the TBC complex with cellular components and its potential as a therapeutic target holds promise for the development of novel treatment strategies for neurodegenerative disorders.
