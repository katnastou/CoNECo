prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: holo-[acyl-carrier-protein] synthase. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we investigated the role of the holo-[acyl-carrier-protein] synthase in the biosynthesis of fatty acids in the pathogenic bacterium causing Lyme disease, Borrelia burgdorferi. Our results demonstrate that the holo-[acyl-carrier-protein] synthase is essential for the activation of acyl carrier protein, a key component in the fatty acid biosynthetic pathway. Furthermore, we observed a significant decrease in fatty acid production in B. burgdorferi when the function of the holo-[acyl-carrier-protein] synthase was inhibited. This insight into the role of holo-[acyl-carrier-protein] synthase provides a potential target for the development of novel antimicrobial agents against Lyme disease.
