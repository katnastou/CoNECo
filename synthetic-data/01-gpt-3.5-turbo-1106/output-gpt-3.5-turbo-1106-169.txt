prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: IFT As. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In the context of cilia formation and function, the intraflagellar transport (IFT) complex plays a pivotal role. One relevant component of this complex is the IFT As complex, which consists of a dynamic assembly of multiple protein subunits. Recent studies have highlighted the essential involvement of the IFT As complex in the pathogenesis of ciliopathies, a group of genetic disorders characterized by defects in cilia structure and/or function. Furthermore, the dysregulation of the IFT As complex has been implicated in various human diseases, including retinal degeneration and polycystic kidney disease. Understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying the assembly and regulation of the IFT As complex is critical for elucidating the cellular pathways related to ciliopathies and holds significant promise for the development of targeted therapeutic interventions.
