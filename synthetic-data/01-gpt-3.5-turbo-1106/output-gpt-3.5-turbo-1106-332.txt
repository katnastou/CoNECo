prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: holo-RdRp. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we investigated the molecular interactions of the holo-RdRp protein complex in the context of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Our findings demonstrate a key role for holo-RdRp in viral RNA replication and transcription, highlighting its potential as a target for antiviral therapy. Furthermore, our analyses revealed the dynamic conformational changes of holo-RdRp during the viral life cycle, shedding light on the intricate mechanisms underlying viral replication. These insights provide a rationale for further exploration of holo-RdRp as a potential therapeutic target in the treatment of COVID-19 and other related viral diseases.
