prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: L-ascorbate permease. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: Our study focuses on the role of L-ascorbate permease in the transport of vitamin C across cellular membranes. Vitamin C, also known as ascorbic acid, is a vital nutrient with antioxidant properties and a wide range of health benefits. Various organisms, including humans, rely on adequate vitamin C uptake to maintain physiological homeostasis and defend against oxidative stress. In this research, we investigate the genetic regulation and biochemical properties of L-ascorbate permease in response to different cellular conditions. Our findings shed light on the mechanisms that govern vitamin C uptake and have implications for understanding the etiology of diseases associated with vitamin C deficiency. This investigation may offer insights into therapeutic approaches for conditions related to impaired vitamin C transport and metabolism.
