prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: fhuCDB. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we investigated the role of the fhuCDB protein complex in the pathogenesis of tuberculosis. Our findings indicate that the fhuCDB complex plays a crucial role in the iron acquisition of Mycobacterium tuberculosis, a causative agent of tuberculosis. We observed a significant upregulation of fhuCDB expression in response to iron limitation, suggesting its involvement in iron uptake and utilization. Furthermore, our results show that the inhibition of fhuCDB activity leads to a significant reduction in M. tuberculosis growth under iron-depleted conditions. These results shed light on the potential of targeting the fhuCDB complex as a novel therapeutic strategy for tuberculosis treatment.
