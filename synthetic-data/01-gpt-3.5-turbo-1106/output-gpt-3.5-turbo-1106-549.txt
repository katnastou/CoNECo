prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: RNAPI. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The impact of non-coding RNAs on gene regulation has been an area of extensive research interest in recent years. The RNAPI complex, a vital component of the transcription machinery, has been shown to be involved in the regulation of various non-coding RNAs, including microRNAs and long non-coding RNAs. Dysregulation of these non-coding RNAs has been implicated in a wide range of diseases, including cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, and metabolic syndromes. Understanding the intricate interactions between RNAPI and non-coding RNAs may provide novel insights into disease pathogenesis and potentially lead to the development of new therapeutic strategies aimed at modulating non-coding RNA expression. Further investigation into the role of RNAPI in non-coding RNA regulation promises to shed light on the complex molecular mechanisms underlying human health and disease.
