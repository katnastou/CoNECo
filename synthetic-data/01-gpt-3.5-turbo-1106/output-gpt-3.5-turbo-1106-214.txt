prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: FACT. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The FACT protein complex has gained attention in recent research due to its role in regulating chromatin structure and DNA replication. Previous studies have highlighted the significant impact of FACT in modulating the stability and expression levels of various genes, impacting the development and progression of diseases such as cancer. Furthermore, studies utilizing model organisms such as Drosophila melanogaster and Caenorhabditis elegans have elucidated the evolutionary conservation of FACT and its essential function in cellular processes. In addition, small molecule inhibitors targeting FACT have shown promising results in preclinical models of cancer, suggesting potential therapeutic implications for targeting FACT in disease treatment. Further investigation into the mechanisms underlying FACT-mediated gene regulation and its implications for disease pathology is warranted to fully understand its potential as a therapeutic target.
