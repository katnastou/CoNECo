prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: Hpa3. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we investigated the role of the Hpa3 protein complex in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Using a murine model of IBD, we observed a significant upregulation of Hpa3 expression in the inflamed intestinal tissues compared to healthy controls. Furthermore, our immunofluorescence staining revealed co-localization of Hpa3 with pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as TNF-Î± and IL-6, within the affected mucosal epithelium. Additionally, treatment with a specific inhibitor of Hpa3 resulted in a significant reduction in the severity of colitis, as evidenced by decreased histopathological scores and reduced levels of inflammatory markers in the serum. These findings suggest that Hpa3 may play a crucial role in modulating the inflammatory response in IBD, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target for the management of this complex and debilitating disease.
