prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: protein acetyltransferase. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The protein acetyltransferase complex plays a crucial role in cellular processes by catalyzing the transfer of acetyl groups onto target proteins, thereby regulating their function and stability. Dysregulation of protein acetylation has been linked to various disease states, including cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, and metabolic disorders. Recent studies have highlighted the potential of targeting the protein acetyltransferase complex as a therapeutic strategy for these conditions. The complex is also involved in numerous signaling pathways, influencing cell differentiation, proliferation, and apoptosis. Further investigating the molecular mechanisms underlying the function of the protein acetyltransferase complex will provide valuable insights into both normal physiological processes and disease pathology.
