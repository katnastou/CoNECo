prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: IgG3. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: A new study investigated the role of the IgG3 protein complex in the pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in a cohort of patients with long-standing disease. The study included analysis of serum samples and synovial fluid from RA patients and healthy controls. The findings revealed elevated levels of IgG3 in the synovial fluid of RA patients compared to healthy controls, suggesting a potential involvement of IgG3 in the local inflammatory response characteristic of RA. Furthermore, the study also showed a positive correlation between IgG3 levels and the disease activity score, as well as the presence of citrullinated protein antigens in the synovial fluid. These results indicate a potential link between IgG3 and the pathophysiology of RA, and suggest that IgG3 may serve as a valuable target for future therapeutic interventions in the management of this debilitating autoimmune condition.
