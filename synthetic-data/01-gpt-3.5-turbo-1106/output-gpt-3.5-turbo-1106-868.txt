prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: galectin-2. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: A growing body of evidence suggests the involvement of galectin-2 in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). In a recent study, levels of galectin-2 were found to be elevated in the colonic tissue of patients with IBD compared to healthy controls. Furthermore, the expression of galectin-2 was positively correlated with the severity of colitis in an animal model of IBD. These findings indicate a potential role for galectin-2 in the inflammatory processes underlying IBD. Given its known involvement in immune regulation and tissue repair, galectin-2 may represent a promising target for the development of novel therapeutic strategies for IBD. Further studies are warranted to elucidate the precise mechanisms by which galectin-2 contributes to the pathogenesis of IBD and to explore its potential as a therapeutic target in this debilitating disease.
