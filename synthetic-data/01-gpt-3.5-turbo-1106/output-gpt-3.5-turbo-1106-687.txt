prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: VEGF-A. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we sought to investigate the regulatory role of VEGF-A in the progression of diabetic retinopathy. We utilized a rodent model of diabetes to elucidate the impact of VEGF-A signaling on the development and severity of retinal vascular complications. Our findings demonstrate a significant upregulation of VEGF-A expression in diabetic animals compared to non-diabetic controls, correlating with the progression of retinal neovascularization and vascular leakage. Furthermore, pharmacological inhibition of VEGF-A activity resulted in a notable reduction in pathological angiogenesis and improved vascular integrity in diabetic retinas. These results suggest that targeting VEGF-A may offer a potential therapeutic strategy for the management of diabetic retinopathy and associated vision loss.
