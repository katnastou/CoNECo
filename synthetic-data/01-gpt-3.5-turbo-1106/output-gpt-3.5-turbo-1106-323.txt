prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: Cystine/glutamate antiporter system xc. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The cystine/glutamate antiporter system xc has been identified as a critical mediator of redox homeostasis and cellular stress response. This heterodimeric membrane protein complex plays an essential role in the transport of cystine and glutamate across the plasma membrane, implicating its involvement in the regulation of antioxidant defenses and cellular signaling pathways. Dysregulation of system xc has been associated with various pathological conditions, including neurodegenerative diseases, cancer, and immune disorders. Pharmacological modulation of system xc activity has shown promise in preclinical studies as a potential therapeutic strategy for these conditions, highlighting the importance of further understanding its molecular mechanisms and physiological functions.
