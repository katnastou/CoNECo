prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: BCKDHC. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: Recent studies have highlighted the crucial role of the BCKDHC protein complex in the pathogenesis of maple syrup urine disease (MSUD), a rare metabolic disorder caused by the accumulation of branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs). The dysregulation of BCKDHC has been implicated in the disruption of the BCAA catabolic pathway, leading to the toxic buildup of metabolites and subsequent neurological complications in affected individuals. Despite the growing understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying BCKDHC dysfunction, therapeutic strategies targeting this protein complex remain limited. Investigating the potential modulation of BCKDHC activity through small molecule inhibitors or gene editing technologies holds promise for the development of novel therapeutic interventions for MSUD and related metabolic disorders.
