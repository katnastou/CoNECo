prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: pre-TCR. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The pre-TCR is a critical signaling complex in T cell development and differentiation. Upon recognition of self-peptides presented by major histocompatibility complex molecules, the pre-TCR triggers intracellular signaling cascades that influence gene expression and cellular fate determination. Dysregulation of pre-TCR signaling has been implicated in various immunological disorders, including autoimmune diseases and immunodeficiency syndromes. Understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying pre-TCR function is crucial for the development of targeted therapies aimed at modulating T cell development and function in autoimmune and immunodeficiency disorders. Furthermore, investigation of the pre-TCR complex may shed light on potential therapeutic targets for the treatment of T cell malignancies.
