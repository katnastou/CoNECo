prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: IL-10 receptor. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The IL-10 receptor plays a crucial role in regulating immune responses and inflammation. Dysregulation of the IL-10 receptor signaling pathway has been implicated in various autoimmune diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis and inflammatory bowel disease. Previous studies have demonstrated the therapeutic potential of targeting the IL-10 receptor to modulate immune function and ameliorate inflammatory conditions. Recent investigations have focused on identifying small molecule inhibitors and monoclonal antibodies that can selectively target the IL-10 receptor, with the aim of developing novel treatments for immune-mediated disorders. Further elucidation of the molecular mechanisms underlying IL-10 receptor activation and downstream signaling pathways may provide valuable insights for the development of targeted therapeutic interventions.
