prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: MutS mismatch repair. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The MutS mismatch repair protein complex plays a critical role in maintaining genomic stability and preventing the accumulation of mutations, which can lead to various diseases including cancer. Dysfunction of the MutS complex has been associated with a higher incidence of microsatellite instability, a genetic condition that predisposes individuals to cancer development. The importance of the MutS complex in DNA repair and maintenance is underscored by its conservation across diverse organisms, from bacteria to humans. Recent studies have highlighted the potential therapeutic implications of targeting the MutS complex in cancer treatment, prompting further investigation into the intricate mechanisms governing its function and regulation. These findings advance our understanding of the molecular pathways involved in maintaining genome integrity and present opportunities for the development of novel strategies to combat cancer progression.
