prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: Oligopeptide permease. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we investigated the role of the Oligopeptide permease in the transport of essential nutrients across the cell membrane. Our results demonstrated a direct association between the functionality of the Oligopeptide permease and the uptake of small peptides, thereby providing insight into its pivotal role in nutrient acquisition. Additionally, our findings revealed a potential link between the malfunction of the Oligopeptide permease and susceptibility to nutrient deficiency-related disorders. These findings shed light on the importance of Oligopeptide permease in maintaining cellular homeostasis and its potential implications for the development of novel therapeutic approaches for addressing malnutrition-related conditions.
