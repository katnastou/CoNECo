prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: Glutamine–oxoglutarate amino transferase. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: Our study investigated the regulatory role of the Glutamine–oxoglutarate amino transferase (GOT) complex in the development of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) in a murine model. We observed a marked upregulation of GOT expression in hepatocytes in response to an atherogenic diet, concurrent with the progression of hepatic steatosis and inflammation. Subsequent analyses revealed a strong positive correlation between GOT levels and the severity of liver injury, as evidenced by increased plasma alanine transaminase and aspartate transaminase levels. Furthermore, pharmacological inhibition of GOT activity resulted in a significant attenuation of hepatic lipid accumulation and amelioration of pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion. Our findings underscore the potential of targeting the GOT complex as a therapeutic strategy for NAFLD and related metabolic disorders.
