prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: exodeoxyribonuclease VII. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: Exodeoxyribonuclease VII, a critical component of the DNA repair pathway, has been implicated in the pathogenesis of various human diseases. Recent studies have demonstrated the involvement of this protein complex in the progression of pancreatic cancer, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target in this devastating disease. Additionally, the inhibition of exodeoxyribonuclease VII has been shown to enhance the efficacy of chemotherapeutic agents in preclinical models, providing a promising strategy for improving the treatment outcomes of pancreatic cancer patients. Further investigation into the mechanistic roles of exodeoxyribonuclease VII in tumorigenesis and its interaction with other cellular pathways may yield valuable insights for the development of novel therapeutic interventions in the management of pancreatic cancer.
