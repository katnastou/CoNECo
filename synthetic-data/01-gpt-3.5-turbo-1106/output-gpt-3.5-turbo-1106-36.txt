prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: thrombospondin. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we investigated the role of the thrombospondin protein complex in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis in a murine model. Our findings revealed a significant upregulation of thrombospondin in atherosclerotic lesions compared to healthy control tissues. Furthermore, we observed a positive correlation between thrombospondin levels and the severity of atherosclerosis in these mice. Additionally, treatment with a small molecule inhibitor targeting thrombospondin led to a reduction in atherosclerotic plaque formation and improved vascular function in the mice. These results suggest that targeting thrombospondin may hold potential as a therapeutic strategy for managing atherosclerosis in humans.
