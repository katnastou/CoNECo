prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: outer dynein arm. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we investigated the role of the outer dynein arm protein complex in the pathogenesis of primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD), a genetically heterogeneous disorder characterized by impaired ciliary motility. Using a high-throughput screening approach, we identified a small molecule compound that modulates the activity of the outer dynein arm, leading to improved ciliary function in PCD patient-derived cells. Furthermore, we observed a significant reduction in respiratory symptoms in a zebrafish model of PCD following treatment with the compound. Our findings provide new insights into the potential therapeutic targeting of the outer dynein arm protein complex for the treatment of PCD.
