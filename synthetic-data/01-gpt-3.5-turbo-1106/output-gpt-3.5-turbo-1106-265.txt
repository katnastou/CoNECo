prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: cytosolic pyruvate dehydrogenase. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we aimed to investigate the role of cytosolic pyruvate dehydrogenase in the progression of type 2 diabetes mellitus. We utilized a murine model of diet-induced obesity and insulin resistance to assess the impact of cytosolic pyruvate dehydrogenase dysregulation on glucose homeostasis. Our findings revealed that aberrant cytosolic pyruvate dehydrogenase activity contributed to impaired insulin signaling and exacerbated hyperglycemia in the obese diabetic mice. Furthermore, we observed a significant upregulation of cytosolic pyruvate dehydrogenase in the skeletal muscle and liver tissues of the obese mice, suggesting a potential association with insulin resistance and glucose intolerance. This study highlights the significance of cytosolic pyruvate dehydrogenase as a potential therapeutic target for managing type 2 diabetes mellitus.
