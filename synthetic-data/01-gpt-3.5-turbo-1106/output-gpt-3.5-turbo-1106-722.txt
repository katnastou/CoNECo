prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: cullins. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The ubiquitin-dependent proteolysis pathway plays a crucial role in the regulation of cellular processes. Cullins, as core components of the Cullin-RING E3 ubiquitin ligases (CRLs), are responsible for the recognition and subsequent ubiquitination of a wide array of substrates, leading to their degradation by the 26S proteasome. Dysregulation of CRL activity has been implicated in various human diseases, including cancer and neurodegenerative disorders. Several small molecule inhibitors targeting cullins have been developed to modulate CRL function, showing promising results in preclinical studies. Understanding the intricate mechanisms governing cullin-mediated proteolysis holds great potential for the development of novel therapeutic interventions for diseases associated with aberrant protein turnover.
