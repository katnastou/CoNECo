prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: T3SS. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The type III secretion system (T3SS) plays a crucial role in the pathogenesis of various bacterial infections, including those caused by Salmonella enterica and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Recent studies have demonstrated that the T3SS translocates effector proteins into host cells, leading to the disruption of cellular processes and the evasion of immune responses. Furthermore, the T3SS has been implicated in the development of gastrointestinal diseases, such as salmonellosis, and respiratory infections, such as pneumonia. Understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying the regulation and function of the T3SS is of great interest for the development of therapeutic interventions targeting bacterial virulence and associated diseases.
