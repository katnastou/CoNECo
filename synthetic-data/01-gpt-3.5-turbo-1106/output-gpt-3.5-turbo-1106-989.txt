prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: 5-HT-3 receptor. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The 5-HT-3 receptor is a ligand-gated ion channel that plays a crucial role in mediating fast synaptic transmission in the central and peripheral nervous systems. This pentameric protein complex is activated by the neurotransmitter serotonin (5-HT) and is implicated in various physiological processes, including nausea and vomiting in response to chemotherapy and anesthesia. Moreover, it has been linked to psychiatric disorders such as anxiety and depression. Given its importance in the modulation of neurotransmission, the 5-HT-3 receptor has emerged as a promising target for the development of pharmaceutical agents aimed at treating these conditions. Research into the interaction of the 5-HT-3 receptor with specific ligands holds significant potential for advancing our understanding of its functional properties and for the discovery of novel therapeutic interventions.
