prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: LInker of Nucleoskeleton and Cytoskeleton. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The LInker of Nucleoskeleton and Cytoskeleton (LINC) protein complex plays a critical role in the structural organization and mechanical stability of the cell. This complex serves as a bridge between the nuclear envelope and the cytoskeletal network, allowing for the transmission of mechanical forces across the cell. Disruption of LINC has been implicated in various human diseases, including muscular dystrophy and cardiomyopathies. Recent studies have also highlighted the involvement of LINC in cellular signaling pathways, implicating its potential role in the regulation of gene expression and cell differentiation. Understanding the molecular mechanisms governing the function of LINC may provide insights into the pathogenesis of these diseases and offer new therapeutic targets for intervention.
