prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: TRAP transporters. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In recent years, the role of TRAP transporters in the pathogenesis of neurological disorders has garnered significant attention. Studies have demonstrated that dysregulation of these transporters is linked to a variety of conditions, including Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease. Furthermore, investigations into the mechanisms of action of TRAP transporters have revealed their involvement in the transport of neurotransmitters and other essential molecules across neuronal membranes. These findings have expanded the understanding of the molecular basis of neurological diseases and have implications for the development of novel therapeutic strategies targeting TRAP transporters. Further elucidation of the precise regulatory pathways and functional significance of TRAP transporters holds great promise for the advancement of treatments for neurological disorders.
