prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: APOBECs. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In recent years, the APOBECs protein complex has garnered significant attention in the field of cancer research due to its potential role in the generation of somatic mutations and its implication in tumor evolution. A growing body of evidence suggests that dysregulation of APOBECs in cancer cells could contribute to genomic instability and the development of oncogenic phenotypes. Several studies have highlighted the involvement of APOBECs in DNA damage and repair pathways, shedding light on the complex interplay between APOBECs and the cellular machinery. Furthermore, the dysregulation of APOBECs has been linked to a variety of malignancies, including breast cancer, lung cancer, and leukemia, highlighting the potential of APOBECs as a therapeutic target for cancer treatment and the identification of novel biomarkers for disease prognosis. Understanding the intricate mechanisms underlying the functions of APOBECs in cancer development holds great promise for the development of targeted therapies and precision medicine strategies.
