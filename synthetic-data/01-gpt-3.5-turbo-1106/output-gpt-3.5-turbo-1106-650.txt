prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: auxin efflux carrier. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In recent years, the role of the auxin efflux carrier in plant development has garnered increasing attention. As a key player in auxin transport, this protein complex is crucial for establishing auxin gradients, regulating plant growth and development. In the model plant species Arabidopsis thaliana, mutations in the auxin efflux carrier have been shown to result in altered root and shoot development, indicating the critical role of this complex in mediating auxin-dependent processes. The manipulation of auxin efflux carriers has been explored as a potential strategy to enhance crop yield and mitigate the impact of abiotic stresses on plant growth. Research on the regulation and function of the auxin efflux carrier holds promise for advancing our understanding of plant development and for informing agricultural practices aimed at enhancing crop productivity.
