prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: ciliary necklaces. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: Our study investigates the role of the ciliary necklaces in the pathogenesis of primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD), a genetically heterogeneous condition characterized by impaired mucociliary clearance in the airways. Through immunofluorescence and electron microscopy analysis of nasal epithelial samples from individuals with PCD, we observed abnormal ciliary necklaces structures, suggesting a potential link between the dysfunction of ciliary necklaces and the ciliary beating defects observed in PCD. Furthermore, our findings demonstrate a disruption in the coordination of ciliary necklaces with other ciliary components, such as the axoneme and basal bodies, highlighting the importance of ciliary necklaces in maintaining ciliary function. Further investigation into the molecular mechanisms underlying ciliary necklaces dysfunction may provide novel insights into the pathophysiology of PCD and identify potential therapeutic targets for this debilitating disease.
