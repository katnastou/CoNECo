prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: tRNA (m2G10) methyltransferase. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The tRNA (m2G10) methyltransferase is a crucial enzyme involved in the modification of transfer RNA (tRNA) molecules. This protein complex plays a significant role in the methylation of specific guanosine residues within the tRNA, impacting the stability and accuracy of protein translation. Dysregulation of tRNA (m2G10) methyltransferase activity has been implicated in certain neurological disorders such as Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease, highlighting its potential relevance in the context of neurodegenerative conditions. Furthermore, the enzymatic function of tRNA (m2G10) methyltransferase is of interest in the development of potential therapeutic strategies targeting tRNA modifications, which may offer novel approaches for the treatment of various disease states related to protein synthesis and folding.
