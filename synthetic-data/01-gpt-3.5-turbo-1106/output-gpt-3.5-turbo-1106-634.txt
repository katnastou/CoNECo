prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: polysome. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we investigated the regulatory role of the polysome in protein synthesis in the context of Alzheimer's disease. Our results demonstrate that the polysome plays a critical role in the translation of proteins associated with neurodegenerative diseases. Furthermore, we observed a significant increase in polysome formation in neuronal cells exposed to amyloid-Î², a peptide implicated in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease. Importantly, our findings suggest that dysregulation of polysome function may contribute to the aberrant protein synthesis observed in Alzheimer's disease, highlighting the potential of targeting the polysome as a therapeutic strategy for neurodegenerative disorders.
