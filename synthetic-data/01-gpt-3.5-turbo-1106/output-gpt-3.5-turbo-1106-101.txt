prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: Ankle link. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we investigated the role of the Ankle link protein complex in the pathogenesis of osteoarthritis. Utilizing a murine model, we observed a significant increase in Ankle link expression in the cartilage tissue of osteoarthritic joints compared to healthy controls. Furthermore, we identified a correlation between Ankle link overexpression and the progression of cartilage degeneration in osteoarthritis. Through gene knockout experiments, we demonstrated a protective effect on cartilage integrity in Ankle link-deficient mice, highlighting the potential therapeutic implications of targeting this protein complex in the treatment of osteoarthritis. Our findings provide valuable insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying osteoarthritis and indicate Ankle link as a promising target for future therapeutic interventions.
