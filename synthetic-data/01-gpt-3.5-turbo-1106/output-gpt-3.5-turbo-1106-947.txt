prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: serpins. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In recent years, there has been growing interest in the role of serpins in the pathogenesis of several diseases, including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency. Serpins are a family of structurally similar proteins that act as serine protease inhibitors, regulating a wide range of physiological processes. The dysregulation of serpins has been implicated in the progression of COPD, where impaired protease-antiprotease balance contributes to the development of the disease. Understanding the intricate interplay between serpins and proteases may offer valuable insights into the pathophysiology of COPD and provide potential targets for therapeutic interventions. Further investigation into the molecular mechanisms underlying the involvement of serpins in these diseases will be crucial for the development of effective treatment strategies.
