prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: DNA methyltransferase. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we investigated the role of DNA methyltransferase in the pathogenesis of colorectal cancer. Our results showed a significant upregulation of DNA methyltransferase expression in tumor tissue compared to adjacent normal tissue. Furthermore, we observed a positive correlation between DNA methyltransferase levels and tumor stage, suggesting a potential role in cancer progression. In addition, we found that inhibition of DNA methyltransferase activity using a specific inhibitor led to a decrease in cancer cell proliferation in in vitro assays. These findings highlight the potential of targeting DNA methyltransferase as a therapeutic strategy for colorectal cancer.
