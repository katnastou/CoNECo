prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 (eIF2) plays a critical role in the regulation of protein synthesis in eukaryotic cells. Dysregulation of eIF2 has been implicated in a variety of diseases, including cancer and neurodegenerative disorders. Recent studies have focused on identifying small molecule inhibitors targeting eIF2 that could potentially serve as therapeutic agents for these conditions. Additionally, the interaction between eIF2 and specific kinases, such as PERK and GCN2, has been investigated to elucidate the molecular mechanisms governing the integrated stress response. Understanding the complex regulatory network involving eIF2 and its associated pathways may offer new insights into the development of treatments for diseases associated with aberrant protein synthesis.
