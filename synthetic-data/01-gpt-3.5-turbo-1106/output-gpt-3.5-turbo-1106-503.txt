prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: RMX. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In recent years, there has been a growing interest in the role of the RMX protein complex in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases. Interestingly, studies have shown that RMX is found to be dysregulated in patients with Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease, suggesting a potential involvement of this protein complex in the progression of these debilitating conditions. Furthermore, RMX has been implicated in the regulation of cellular oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction, both of which are key factors in the development of neurodegenerative disorders. The findings from these studies support the notion that targeting the RMX protein complex may offer promising therapeutic avenues for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases. More research is warranted to elucidate the precise molecular mechanisms underlying the involvement of RMX in neurodegeneration and to explore the potential for developing novel interventions targeting this protein complex.
