prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: NADH-Q oxidoreductase. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we investigated the effects of a novel compound, designated as Compound X, on the activity of the NADH-Q oxidoreductase complex in a murine model of Parkinson's disease. Our results demonstrated that treatment with Compound X led to a significant increase in the enzymatic activity of NADH-Q oxidoreductase in the substantia nigra of the Parkinson's disease model mice. Additionally, we observed a decrease in the levels of reactive oxygen species and an improvement in motor function following administration of Compound X. These findings suggest that modulation of NADH-Q oxidoreductase activity may represent a promising therapeutic strategy for Parkinson's disease. Further investigations into the molecular mechanisms underlying the interaction between Compound X and NADH-Q oxidoreductase are warranted to elucidate its potential as a therapeutic agent for Parkinson's disease.
