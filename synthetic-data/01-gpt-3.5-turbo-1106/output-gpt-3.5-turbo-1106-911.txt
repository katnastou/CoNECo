prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: pre-snoRNP. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The pre-snoRNP complex plays a crucial role in the biogenesis of small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs), which are essential for the modification and processing of ribosomal RNA. Dysregulation of pre-snoRNP assembly and function has been implicated in several neurodevelopmental disorders, including Prader-Willi syndrome and Angelman syndrome. Recent studies have demonstrated the involvement of the pre-snoRNP complex in the pathogenesis of spinal muscular atrophy, a severe neuromuscular disease associated with loss of motor neurons. Furthermore, aberrant pre-snoRNP expression has been linked to various malignancies, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target in cancer treatment. Understanding the molecular mechanisms governing pre-snoRNP activity and its dysregulation in disease states may provide valuable insights for the development of novel therapeutic strategies.
