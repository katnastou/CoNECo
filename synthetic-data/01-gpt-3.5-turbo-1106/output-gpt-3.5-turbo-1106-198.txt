prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: NADH-ubiquinone reductases. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, the role of the NADH-ubiquinone reductases protein complex in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease was investigated. The complex is known for its crucial involvement in the electron transport chain, leading to the generation of ATP in aerobic respiration. A cohort of patients with Parkinson's disease was analyzed for variations in levels of NADH-ubiquinone reductases and its impact on mitochondrial function. The findings revealed a significant reduction in the activity of the complex, indicating a potential link between impaired electron transport and the development of Parkinson's disease. This study underscores the importance of understanding the molecular mechanisms involving NADH-ubiquinone reductases in neurodegenerative disorders, providing insights into potential therapeutic targets for managing Parkinson's disease.
