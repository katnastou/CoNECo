prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: Five Friends of Methylated Chtop. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The Five Friends of Methylated Chtop (5FMC) protein complex has recently gained attention for its potential role in human diseases, particularly cancer. Previous studies have demonstrated that 5FMC interacts with methylated Chtop, a key regulator of mRNA processing and stability. In addition, the complex has been shown to play a role in chromatin remodeling and DNA repair. These findings point to the multifunctional nature of 5FMC and suggest that dysregulation of this complex may contribute to disease pathogenesis. Further investigation into the molecular mechanisms underlying 5FMC function and its potential as a therapeutic target is warranted to fully understand its implications in disease progression.
