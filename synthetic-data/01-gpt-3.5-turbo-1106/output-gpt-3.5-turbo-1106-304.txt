prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: dihydrolipoyl dehydrogenases. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we investigated the role of dihydrolipoyl dehydrogenases in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease. Our findings revealed a significant upregulation of dihydrolipoyl dehydrogenases expression in the substantia nigra of Parkinson's disease patients compared to healthy controls. Furthermore, using a mouse model of Parkinson's disease, we observed that genetic ablation of dihydrolipoyl dehydrogenases led to a reduction in the severity of motor deficits and dopaminergic neuron degeneration. Our results suggest that dihydrolipoyl dehydrogenases may play a crucial role in the neurodegenerative processes underlying Parkinson's disease and could serve as a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of this devastating condition.
