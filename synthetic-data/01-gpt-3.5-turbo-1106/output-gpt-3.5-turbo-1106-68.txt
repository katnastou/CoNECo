prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: ADDL. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the aggregation of amyloid-β (Aβ) peptides in the brain. A key contributor to the pathogenesis of AD is the toxic effects of Aβ oligomers, with particular attention given to the Aβ-derived diffusible ligands (ADDL) complex. The formation of ADDL is associated with synaptic dysfunction and neurodegeneration in AD. Recent studies have suggested that targeting ADDL may offer promise in developing potential therapeutics for AD. Nonetheless, the precise mechanisms underlying the role of the ADDL complex in AD pathogenesis remain to be fully elucidated. Further research is necessary to unravel the complex interplay of ADDL with other molecular and cellular pathways in the progression of AD.
