prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: negative elongation factor. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In recent years, negative elongation factor (NELF) has emerged as a crucial regulator of transcriptional elongation. Studies have implicated NELF in the pathogenesis of various diseases, including cancer and neurodegenerative disorders. Further research has revealed potential therapeutic interventions targeting NELF to modulate gene expression in disease states. Notably, small molecule inhibitors of NELF have shown promising results in preclinical models, highlighting the potential for NELF-targeted therapies in the future. Understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying NELF function and dysregulation will be instrumental in advancing the development of novel treatment strategies for a range of pathological conditions.
