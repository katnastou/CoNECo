prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: endodeoxyribonucleases. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we investigated the role of endodeoxyribonucleases in the repair of DNA damage in mammalian cells. We examined the impact of various chemical agents, such as cisplatin and doxorubicin, on the expression and activity of endodeoxyribonucleases. Our findings suggest that these endodeoxyribonucleases play a critical role in the cellular response to DNA damage, particularly in the context of cancer treatment. Furthermore, we demonstrated that mutations in genes encoding critical components of the endodeoxyribonucleases complex are associated with increased susceptibility to hereditary diseases characterized by DNA repair deficiencies. These results provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying the cellular response to genotoxic stress and have implications for the development of targeted therapies for cancer and DNA repair-related disorders.
