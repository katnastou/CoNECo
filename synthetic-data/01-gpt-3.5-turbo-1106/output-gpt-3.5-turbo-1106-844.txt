prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: type III polyketide synthases. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: Type III polyketide synthases (PKS) are an essential group of enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of a wide range of natural products with various biological activities. These enzyme complexes are prevalent in numerous organisms, including plants, fungi, and bacteria, and are responsible for the production of diverse polyketide compounds, such as antibiotics, antitumor agents, and pigments. The intricate catalytic machinery of type III PKS utilizes acyl carrier protein (ACP) and Î²-ketoacyl reductase (KR) domains to precisely orchestrate the iterative condensation, modification, and cyclization of small molecule precursors, ultimately leading to the formation of structurally complex polyketides. Understanding the molecular mechanisms and substrate specificities of type III PKS is crucial for the rational design of novel therapeutic agents and the engineering of biosynthetic pathways for pharmaceutical and biotechnological applications.
