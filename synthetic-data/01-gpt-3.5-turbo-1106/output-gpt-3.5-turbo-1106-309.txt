prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: connexon. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The connexon protein complex plays a crucial role in intercellular communication through gap junction channels in various biological processes. The regulation of connexon function has been implicated in the development and progression of several diseases, including cardiovascular disorders and certain types of cancer. Studies have shown the involvement of connexons in the exchange of signaling molecules, ions, and small metabolites between neighboring cells, underscoring their importance in tissue homeostasis and coordination of cellular activities. Furthermore, pharmacological modulators targeting connexons have potential therapeutic implications for conditions characterized by impaired intercellular communication, highlighting the significance of further exploration of connexon function and modulation in disease management.
