prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: metabotropic GABA receptors. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: Activation of the metabotropic GABA receptors has been implicated in the modulation of synaptic transmission and the regulation of neuronal excitability. In the central nervous system, these receptors play a crucial role in the regulation of various physiological and pathological processes, including anxiety disorders, epilepsy, and drug addiction. Additionally, the metabotropic GABA receptors have been shown to interact with various neurotransmitters and intracellular signaling pathways, leading to the modulation of neuronal function and plasticity. Understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying the activation and signaling of these receptors is critical for the development of novel therapeutic strategies targeting neurological and psychiatric disorders.
