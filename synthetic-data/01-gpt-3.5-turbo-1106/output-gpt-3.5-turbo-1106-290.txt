prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: glycyl transfer ribonucleic acid synthetase. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The role of the glycyl transfer ribonucleic acid synthetase (GlyRS) protein complex in neurodegenerative diseases has been the subject of recent investigation. Studies have shown that dysregulation of GlyRS expression and function is associated with the pathogenesis of various neurodegenerative disorders, including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease. Furthermore, aberrant GlyRS activity has been implicated in the impairment of neuronal protein synthesis and synaptic dysfunction, contributing to the progressive degeneration of motor neurons and axonal demyelination. Understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying the involvement of GlyRS in these diseases may present novel therapeutic opportunities for targeting this protein complex and modulating its activity to alleviate neurodegenerative pathology.
