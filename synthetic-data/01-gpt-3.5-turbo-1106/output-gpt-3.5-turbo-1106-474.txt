prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: TGFB. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we investigate the role of the Transforming Growth Factor Beta (TGFB) protein complex in the pathogenesis of pulmonary fibrosis, a progressive and often fatal lung disease. Prior research has suggested that dysregulation of TGFB signaling plays a pivotal role in the development and progression of pulmonary fibrosis. Using a mouse model of the disease, we observed a significant upregulation of TGFB expression in lung tissue affected by fibrosis. Furthermore, treatment with a small molecule inhibitor of TGFB signaling resulted in attenuated fibrotic lesions and improved lung function in the affected mice. These findings support the potential therapeutic targeting of the TGFB protein complex as a promising strategy for the treatment of pulmonary fibrosis.
