prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: ESCRT-0. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The ESCRT-0 protein complex, a crucial component of the endosomal sorting complex required for transport (ESCRT) machinery, plays a central role in the selective sorting of ubiquitinated membrane proteins into multivesicular bodies (MVBs) for eventual lysosomal degradation. Dysregulation of ESCRT-0 has been implicated in various pathophysiological conditions, including viral budding, neurodegenerative diseases, and cancer metastasis. However, the precise mechanisms underlying ESCRT-0 function and regulation remain incompletely understood. Recent studies have highlighted the potential therapeutic implications of targeting ESCRT-0 in the context of diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, and various malignancies. Further elucidation of the molecular interactions and cellular pathways involving ESCRT-0 holds promise for the development of novel therapeutic strategies for these devastating conditions.
