prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: tubulin. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The cytoskeleton is a dynamic network of protein complexes essential for maintaining cellular structure and motility. Among these complexes, tubulin is a highly conserved heterodimeric protein that forms microtubules, crucial for cell division, intracellular transport, and cell motility. Dysregulation of tubulin expression or function has been implicated in various diseases, including cancer and neurodegenerative disorders. In recent years, the development of small molecule inhibitors targeting tubulin has shown promise in cancer therapy, disrupting microtubule dynamics and leading to cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. However, challenges such as drug resistance and off-target effects have prompted further investigations into the mechanisms underlying tubulin-associated pathologies and the development of novel therapeutic strategies targeting tubulin and its interacting partners.
