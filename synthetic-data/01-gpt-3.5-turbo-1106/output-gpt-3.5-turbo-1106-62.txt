prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: Clr6 histone deacetylase complex II. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The role of the Clr6 histone deacetylase complex II in the regulation of gene expression has been the subject of intense investigation in recent years. This protein complex has been found to play a crucial role in modulating chromatin structure and function, thereby influencing various cellular and developmental processes. Recent studies have highlighted the involvement of the Clr6 histone deacetylase complex II in the pathogenesis of certain hematological malignancies, including lymphoma and leukemia. Furthermore, manipulation of the complex's activity has shown promise in the treatment of neurodegenerative disorders such as Huntington's disease and Parkinson's disease. The intricate involvement of the Clr6 histone deacetylase complex II in these diverse biological processes underscores its potential as a therapeutic target for various human diseases. Further research into the molecular mechanisms underlying the function of this complex is warranted to fully elucidate its role in health and disease.
