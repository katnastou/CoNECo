prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: outer kinetochore plates. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: Inhibition of the outer kinetochore plates has emerged as a promising strategy for targeting mitotic spindle formation and chromosome segregation in cancer cells. Previous studies have demonstrated that dysregulation of the outer kinetochore plates contributes to chromosomal instability and aneuploidy, which are key drivers of tumorigenesis. Recent evidence suggests that small molecule inhibitors targeting the outer kinetochore plates may have therapeutic potential for the treatment of various malignancies, including breast cancer and colon cancer. Further investigation into the molecular mechanisms underlying the assembly and function of the outer kinetochore plates is warranted to elucidate their significance in cancer progression and to identify novel therapeutic targets for precision medicine approaches.
