prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: SAT-OASS. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: Recent research has implicated the SAT-OASS protein complex in the pathogenesis of cystathionine beta-synthase deficiency, a metabolic disorder that leads to elevated levels of homocysteine and decreased levels of cysteine. The enzymatic activity of the SAT-OASS complex is crucial for the synthesis of cysteine and the regulation of homocysteine levels. Dysregulation of the SAT-OASS complex has been associated with decreased cysteine production and increased oxidative stress, which may contribute to the development of cardiovascular complications in individuals with cystathionine beta-synthase deficiency. Targeting the SAT-OASS complex could offer a potential therapeutic approach to ameliorate the biochemical imbalances associated with this disorder. Further investigation into the molecular mechanisms underlying the function of SAT-OASS is warranted to facilitate the development of targeted interventions for cystathionine beta-synthase deficiency.
