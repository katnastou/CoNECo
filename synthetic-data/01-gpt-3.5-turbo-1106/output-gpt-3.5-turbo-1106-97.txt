prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: cullin-RING ligase 2. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we investigated the role of the cullin-RING ligase 2 (CRL2) complex in the development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Through a comprehensive analysis of HCC patient samples and in vitro experiments using human hepatoma cell lines, we demonstrated a potential association between CRL2 expression levels and the progression of HCC. Furthermore, we identified a novel small molecule inhibitor that specifically disrupts the function of CRL2, leading to reduced tumor growth in xenograft mouse models. Our findings not only shed light on the oncogenic role of CRL2 in HCC but also provide a promising therapeutic target for the treatment of this aggressive liver malignancy.
