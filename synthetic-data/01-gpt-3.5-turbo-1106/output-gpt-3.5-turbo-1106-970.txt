prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: ryanodine receptors. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The ryanodine receptors are a class of intracellular calcium release channels found in muscle cells, including skeletal, cardiac, and smooth muscle. These channels play a crucial role in excitation-contraction coupling, as they are responsible for releasing calcium from the sarcoplasmic reticulum into the cytoplasm in response to depolarization. Dysregulation of ryanodine receptors has been implicated in various muscle diseases, such as malignant hyperthermia and heart failure. Pharmacological modulation of these receptors has shown potential in the treatment of these conditions, making them an important target for drug discovery efforts. The intricate regulation and function of ryanodine receptors continue to be a focus of active research in the field of muscle physiology and disease.
