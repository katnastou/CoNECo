prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: decoy receptors. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we aimed to investigate the role of decoy receptors in modulating the inflammatory response in rheumatoid arthritis. Rheumatoid arthritis is a chronic autoimmune disease characterized by persistent inflammation in the synovium, leading to joint destruction and disability. Decoy receptors are known to act as negative regulators of cytokine signaling by competitively binding to cytokines and preventing their interaction with cell surface receptors. In our experimental model, we observed that the administration of a small molecule inhibitor targeting decoy receptors resulted in a significant increase in the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, exacerbating disease severity. These findings suggest that decoy receptors play a critical role in regulating the immune response and may represent a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis.
