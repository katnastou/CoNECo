prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: NMDA-selective glutamate receptor. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: Recent studies have implicated dysregulation of the NMDA-selective glutamate receptor in the pathophysiology of several neuropsychiatric disorders, including schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and major depressive disorder. The receptor complex, consisting of subunits NR1, NR2A, NR2B, NR2C, and NR2D, plays a crucial role in synaptic transmission and synaptic plasticity in the central nervous system. Dysfunctional NMDA receptor signaling has been linked to aberrant glutamatergic neurotransmission and impaired neuroplasticity, which may contribute to the development and progression of these psychiatric conditions. Understanding the mechanisms underlying NMDA receptor dysfunction may pave the way for the development of novel therapeutic strategies targeting this receptor complex for the treatment of neuropsychiatric disorders.
