prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: AMPA glutamate receptor. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The AMPA glutamate receptor, a pivotal player in excitatory neurotransmission, has garnered increasing attention for its role in neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's. Recent studies have seamlessly linked the dysregulation of AMPA glutamate receptor activity to cognitive impairments and motor dysfunction in several animal models, implicating the need for targeted interventions. Moreover, the interaction of AMPA glutamate receptors with calcium-binding proteins and ion channels has emerged as a critical avenue for neuroprotective strategies, with potential ramifications for therapeutic development. Given the multifaceted involvement of AMPA glutamate receptors in neurodegenerative pathophysiology, this complex represents a promising target for the development of novel treatment modalities aiming to modulate disease progression.
