prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: TGF-betas. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In the current study, we investigate the role of TGF-betas in the progression of pulmonary fibrosis. Pulmonary fibrosis is a chronic and progressive interstitial lung disease characterized by excessive deposition of extracellular matrix proteins, leading to impaired lung function. The TGF-betas protein complex has been implicated in various cellular processes, including regulation of cell growth, differentiation, and apoptosis. Using a murine model of pulmonary fibrosis, we demonstrate that increased expression and activation of TGF-betas are associated with disease progression and lung function decline. Furthermore, our findings suggest that targeting the TGF-betas signaling pathway may represent a potential therapeutic strategy for the treatment of pulmonary fibrosis.
