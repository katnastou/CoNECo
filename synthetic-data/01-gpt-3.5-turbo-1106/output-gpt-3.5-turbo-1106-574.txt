prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: mSWI/SNF. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The mSWI/SNF protein complex is a critical regulator of gene expression and has been implicated in various pathways related to cancer development and growth. Dysregulation of mSWI/SNF has been associated with several malignancies, including lung adenocarcinoma and rhabdoid tumors. In addition to its role in cancer, the mSWI/SNF complex has also been shown to modulate immune responses and contribute to the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus. Investigation into the molecular mechanisms underlying the functions of mSWI/SNF is central to understanding its involvement in disease pathology and may lead to the development of targeted therapies for these conditions.
