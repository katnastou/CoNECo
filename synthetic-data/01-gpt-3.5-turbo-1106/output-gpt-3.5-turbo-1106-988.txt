prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: NDC1. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The nuclear pore complex (NPC) is a highly organized structure that regulates the transport of macromolecules between the nucleus and the cytoplasm. One integral component of the NPC is the NDC1 protein complex, which has been found to play a crucial role in maintaining the integrity of the nuclear envelope. Recent studies have implicated NDC1 in the development of certain genetic disorders, including autosomal recessive spinocerebellar ataxia type 4 (SCAR4). Additionally, interactions between NDC1 and specific lipid molecules have been shown to influence the localization and stability of the nuclear envelope, highlighting the potential therapeutic relevance of targeting NDC1-associated pathways in the treatment of nuclear envelope-related diseases. Further investigation into the precise molecular mechanisms governing NDC1 function may yield valuable insights into the pathogenesis of these disorders and provide new opportunities for therapeutic intervention.
