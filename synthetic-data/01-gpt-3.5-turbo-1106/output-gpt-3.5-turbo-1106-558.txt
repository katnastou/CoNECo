prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: Polar amino acid ABC transporters. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In recent years, the role of the Polar amino acid ABC transporters in the pathogenesis of certain psychiatric disorders has garnered increasing interest. Studies have shown that mutations in the genes encoding these transporters result in dysregulated transport and uptake of polar amino acids in the brain, leading to disruptions in neurotransmitter balance and synaptic transmission. Aberrant functioning of these transporters has been implicated in the etiology of depression, anxiety, and bipolar disorder. Furthermore, dysregulation of polar amino acid transport has been observed in animal models of these psychiatric conditions, highlighting the potential relevance of these transporters in the development of novel therapeutic approaches. Understanding the precise mechanisms by which the Polar amino acid ABC transporters contribute to psychiatric disorders may offer promising avenues for targeted interventions and personalized treatment strategies.
