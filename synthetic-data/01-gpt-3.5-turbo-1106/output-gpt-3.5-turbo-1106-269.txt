prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: VLA-3. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we investigated the role of the VLA-3 protein complex in the pathogenesis of systemic sclerosis, a chronic autoimmune disease. Our results demonstrate that VLA-3 is significantly upregulated in dermal fibroblasts from patients with systemic sclerosis compared to healthy controls. Moreover, we found that pharmacological inhibition of VLA-3 using a small molecule compound led to a reduction in collagen production and fibroblast activation in a murine model of systemic sclerosis. These findings suggest that targeting VLA-3 may represent a promising therapeutic approach for combating fibrosis in systemic sclerosis. Further studies elucidating the specific molecular interactions and downstream signaling pathways involving VLA-3 are warranted to fully comprehend its potential as a therapeutic target.
