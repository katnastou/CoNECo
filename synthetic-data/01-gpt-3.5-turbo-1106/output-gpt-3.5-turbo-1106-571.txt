prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: Cholera toxin. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: Cholera toxin is a potent virulence factor produced by Vibrio cholerae, the causative agent of cholera. This protein complex is responsible for the severe diarrheal disease associated with cholera infection. Upon ingestion, Cholera toxin binds to the surface of intestinal epithelial cells, leading to the activation of adenylate cyclase and subsequent intracellular cAMP accumulation. This dysregulation of intracellular signaling pathways ultimately results in the excessive secretion of electrolytes and water into the intestinal lumen, leading to the characteristic profuse watery diarrhea observed in cholera patients. The ability of Cholera toxin to induce such profound gastrointestinal symptoms underscores its significance as a key virulence factor in the pathogenesis of cholera and highlights its potential as a target for therapeutic intervention.
