prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: HDL particle. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: Our study aimed to investigate the role of the HDL particle in the pathophysiology of atherosclerosis. We conducted a case-control study involving patients diagnosed with coronary artery disease (CAD) and age-matched healthy controls. Plasma levels of the HDL particle were quantified using immunoassays, while the presence of atherosclerotic plaques was determined through imaging techniques such as coronary angiography and intravascular ultrasound. Additionally, circulating levels of lipids and inflammatory markers were measured to assess their correlation with HDL particle levels. Our findings revealed a significant inverse association between HDL particle concentration and the extent of atherosclerotic plaque burden in patients with CAD. Furthermore, we observed a negative correlation between HDL particle levels and systemic inflammation markers, suggesting a potential protective role of this protein complex against atherosclerosis development. The results of this study provide important insights into the contribution of the HDL particle in the pathogenesis of CAD and may have implications for the development of novel therapeutic strategies targeting this biomolecule.
