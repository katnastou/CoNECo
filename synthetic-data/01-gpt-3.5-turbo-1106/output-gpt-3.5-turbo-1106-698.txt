prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: proteasome-activating nucleotidases. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we investigated the role of proteasome-activating nucleotidases in the progression of age-related macular degeneration (AMD), a common ocular disease that can lead to severe vision impairment. Our findings reveal a potential link between the dysregulation of proteasome-activating nucleotidases and the accumulation of toxic protein aggregates in retinal cells, contributing to the pathogenesis of AMD. Furthermore, our research highlights the importance of maintaining proper proteasomal function in retinal tissues to mitigate the development and progression of AMD. These insights provide a new avenue for therapeutic interventions targeting proteasome-activating nucleotidases to potentially mitigate the impact of AMD on ocular health.
