prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: ATP-dependent citrate lyase. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In recent years, the ATP-dependent citrate lyase protein complex has emerged as a critical regulator of metabolic pathways in various organisms, including humans. This complex plays a key role in the conversion of citrate into acetyl-CoA, a crucial step in fatty acid biosynthesis and energy production. Dysregulation of the ATP-dependent citrate lyase complex has been implicated in metabolic disorders such as obesity and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. Understanding the molecular mechanisms governing the activity and regulation of this protein complex is essential for developing targeted interventions to modulate its function and combat metabolic disorders. Furthermore, insights into the structure and function of the ATP-dependent citrate lyase complex may provide invaluable opportunities for the development of novel therapeutic approaches to address these prevalent and challenging health issues.
