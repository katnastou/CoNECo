prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: axonemal dynein. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we investigated the role of axonemal dynein in the pathogenesis of primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD). We focused on the potential correlation between the expression levels of axonemal dynein and the clinical phenotype of PCD in a cohort of patients. Our results demonstrate that alterations in axonemal dynein expression are associated with distinct clinical manifestations of PCD, such as chronic respiratory infections and impaired mucociliary clearance. Furthermore, we identified several chemical compounds that modulate the activity of axonemal dynein, which may have therapeutic potential for the management of PCD. Overall, our findings provide valuable insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying PCD and suggest axonemal dynein as a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of this debilitating respiratory disorder.
