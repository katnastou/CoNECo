prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: MKS module. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In the present study, we investigated the role of the MKS module in the pathogenesis of Bardet-Biedl syndrome (BBS), a ciliopathy characterized by retinal degeneration, obesity, renal dysfunction, polydactyly, and cognitive impairment. Our findings demonstrate that disruption of the MKS module leads to defective ciliogenesis and abnormal ciliary signaling, contributing to the development of BBS-associated phenotypes. Utilizing zebrafish models, we show that pharmacological modulation of the MKS module improves ciliary function and ameliorates disease manifestations. This study provides compelling evidence for the pivotal role of the MKS module in ciliary biology and establishes its potential as a therapeutic target for BBS and related ciliopathies.
