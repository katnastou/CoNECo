prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: NPHP. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The role of the NPHP protein complex in the pathogenesis of nephronophthisis, a rare autosomal recessive cystic kidney disease, has been the focus of considerable research. In recent studies, the interactions between the NPHP complex and other key cellular components, such as cilia and signaling molecules, have been investigated to gain insights into the underlying molecular mechanisms. For example, the NPHP complex has been found to be involved in the regulation of Wnt signaling pathways, which are crucial for normal kidney development and function. Additionally, dysregulation of the NPHP complex has been implicated in the development of retinal degeneration associated with Senior-LÃ¸ken syndrome, highlighting the broader impact of NPHP complex dysfunction beyond renal pathology. Understanding the intricate molecular interactions involving the NPHP complex is essential for elucidating the pathophysiology of these complex genetic disorders and for the development of targeted therapeutic interventions.
