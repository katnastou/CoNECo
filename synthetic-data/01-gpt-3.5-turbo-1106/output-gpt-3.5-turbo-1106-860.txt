prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: OSTCI. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we investigated the role of the OSTCI protein complex in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Our findings revealed a significant upregulation of OSTCI expression in the intestinal mucosa of IBD patients compared to healthy controls. Furthermore, we identified a correlation between elevated OSTCI levels and the severity of gastrointestinal inflammation in IBD. Additionally, we observed a positive association between OSTCI expression and the presence of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis factor-alpha. These findings suggest that the OSTCI complex may play a crucial role in the dysregulation of immune responses and the progression of IBD. Our study underscores the potential of targeting the OSTCI complex as a novel therapeutic strategy for alleviating the inflammatory burden in IBD patients.
