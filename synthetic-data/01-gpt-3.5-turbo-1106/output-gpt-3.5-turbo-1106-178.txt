prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: Succinic dehydrogenase. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we investigated the role of the Succinic dehydrogenase complex in the context of mitochondrial dysfunction in Parkinson's disease. Using a mouse model, we observed a significant decrease in the activity of Succinic dehydrogenase in the substantia nigra, a brain region known to be affected in Parkinson's disease. Furthermore, analysis of post-mortem brain tissue from Parkinson's disease patients revealed a reduction in the expression levels of key subunits of the Succinic dehydrogenase complex. Our findings suggest that alterations in Succinic dehydrogenase activity may contribute to the mitochondrial dysfunction seen in Parkinson's disease, highlighting the potential importance of targeting this complex for therapeutic intervention in the future.
