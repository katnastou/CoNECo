prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: NADH dehydrogenase. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we investigated the role of the NADH dehydrogenase complex in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease. Our findings demonstrate a significant upregulation of NADH dehydrogenase expression in neuronal cells exposed to mitochondrial stressors such as rotenone and paraquat. Furthermore, we observed an increase in reactive oxygen species production and a decrease in ATP levels in cells overexpressing NADH dehydrogenase. These results suggest a critical involvement of NADH dehydrogenase in the dysregulation of mitochondrial function observed in Parkinson's disease. Our study provides novel insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying mitochondrial dysfunction and neurodegeneration, highlighting the potential therapeutic targeting of NADH dehydrogenase as a strategy for treating this debilitating disorder.
