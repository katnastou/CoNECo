prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: HCab. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The HCab protein complex has emerged as a key regulator in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease. Recent studies have demonstrated that HCab plays a critical role in modulating the cellular response to oxidative stress, inflammation, and protein aggregation, which are hallmark features of these neurodegenerative disorders. Furthermore, HCab has been shown to interact with various chemical entities involved in cellular signaling pathways, suggesting its involvement in mediating cellular homeostasis. These findings highlight the potential of targeting HCab as a therapeutic strategy for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases. Further investigations into the molecular mechanisms underlying the role of HCab in neurodegeneration are warranted to elucidate its therapeutic potential.
