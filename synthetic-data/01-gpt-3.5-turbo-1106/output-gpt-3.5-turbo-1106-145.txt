prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: exon junction. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In recent years, there has been growing interest in the regulatory role of the exon junction complex in various physiological and pathological conditions. Current studies suggest that the exon junction complex is involved in mRNA quality control and surveillance mechanisms. Dysregulation of the exon junction complex has been implicated in the pathogenesis of neurodevelopmental disorders, such as autism spectrum disorder and intellectual disability. Furthermore, perturbations in the exon junction complex have been shown to influence the development and progression of certain types of cancer. Given the complex and multifaceted role of the exon junction complex, further investigation and elucidation of its molecular mechanisms are essential for understanding its broader implications in health and disease.
