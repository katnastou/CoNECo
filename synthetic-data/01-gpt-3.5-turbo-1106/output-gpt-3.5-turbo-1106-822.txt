prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: interleukin-28 receptor. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: A key player in the host immune response to viral infections, the interleukin-28 receptor has garnered increasing attention in the field of antiviral therapy. Recent studies have revealed the association of this receptor with favorable outcomes in patients infected with hepatitis C virus, implicating its potential as a therapeutic target. Inhibition of this receptor has shown promise in preclinical models of viral hepatitis, leading to decreased viral load and amelioration of liver inflammation. Furthermore, the use of pharmacological agents targeting the interleukin-28 receptor has demonstrated efficacy in controlling viral replication and mitigating the progression of hepatitis C-related liver fibrosis. These findings underscore the significance of the interleukin-28 receptor as a pivotal component in the host immune defense against viral pathogens, offering novel opportunities for the development of antiviral strategies aimed at combatting hepatitis C infection.
