prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: KEOPS/EKC. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The KEOPS/EKC protein complex (KEOPS/EKC) has garnered significant attention in the field of molecular biology due to its critical role in the pathogenesis of several genetic disorders, including Galloway-Mowat syndrome and familial glucosuria. Recent studies have elucidated the intricate interplay between the KEOPS/EKC complex and the molecular entities responsible for DNA replication and repair. This has provided valuable insights into the etiology of various cancers, highlighting the potential therapeutic targets for the development of novel anticancer agents. Furthermore, the dysregulation of KEOPS/EKC has been implicated in the progression of neurodegenerative diseases, underscoring the importance of further investigations into its molecular mechanisms and potential therapeutic interventions. The intricate relationships between KEOPS/EKC and other biological entities continue to be a subject of intense research in the biomedical community, with promising implications for the development of targeted treatments for a wide array of genetic and neurodegenerative disorders.
