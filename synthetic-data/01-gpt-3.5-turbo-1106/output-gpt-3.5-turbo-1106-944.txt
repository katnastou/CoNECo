prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: alpha-glucosidase IIs. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we investigated the role of alpha-glucosidase IIs in the pathogenesis of Pompe disease. Pompe disease, also known as glycogen storage disease type II, is a lysosomal storage disorder caused by a deficiency of acid alpha-glucosidase. Our findings revealed that alpha-glucosidase IIs interacts with the lysosomal membrane proteins, facilitating the transport of glycogen and other substrates into the lysosome for degradation. Furthermore, we observed that chemical inhibition of alpha-glucosidase IIs led to an accumulation of glycogen in patient-derived fibroblasts, mimicking the pathological phenotype observed in Pompe disease. These results emphasize the potential therapeutic significance of targeting alpha-glucosidase IIs for the development of novel treatment strategies for Pompe disease.
