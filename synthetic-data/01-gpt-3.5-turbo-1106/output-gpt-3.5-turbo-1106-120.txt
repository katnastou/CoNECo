prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: Multiaminoacyl-tRNA synthetases. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: Our study investigated the role of the Multiaminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (MARS) in the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases, particularly systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). We analyzed serum samples from SLE patients and healthy controls for the presence of autoantibodies targeting MARS. Our results reveal a significant increase in the levels of anti-MARS autoantibodies in SLE patients compared to healthy controls, suggesting a potential involvement of MARS in the autoimmune response. Furthermore, we observed a positive correlation between anti-MARS autoantibody levels and disease activity in SLE patients. These findings provide new insights into the potential role of MARS in the pathophysiology of autoimmune diseases and may pave the way for the development of novel diagnostic and therapeutic strategies targeting MARS in SLE.
