prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: polarisome. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The polarisome is a key protein complex involved in the organization and regulation of the actin cytoskeleton, which plays a critical role in controlling cell shape and movement. Recent studies have highlighted the role of polarisome in the pathogenesis of certain human diseases, particularly those involving abnormal cell motility and migration. Furthermore, the dysregulation of polarisome activity has been implicated in the development of metastatic cancer, making it an attractive target for therapeutic intervention. Understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying polarisome-mediated actin dynamics is essential for delineating its involvement in disease processes and for developing novel strategies to modulate its function for therapeutic purposes.
