prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: NDH-I. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: Recent studies have shown the critical role of the NDH-I protein complex in modulating the electron transport chain in chloroplasts of photosynthetic organisms. The NDH-I complex is a key player in the regulation of photosynthetic activity by participating in the transfer of electrons and protons across the thylakoid membrane. Dysregulation of NDH-I has been implicated in various physiological disorders, including impaired photosynthetic efficiency and decreased plant productivity. Understanding the structure and function of the NDH-I complex is crucial for developing strategies to manipulate its activity, potentially leading to improved crop yields and greater resilience of plants to environmental stresses. Further investigations into the molecular mechanisms governing the assembly and activity of the NDH-I complex could provide valuable insights into the optimization of photosynthesis and its impact on agricultural and ecological systems.
