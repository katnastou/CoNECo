prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: SEACAT. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we aimed to investigate the role of the SEACAT protein complex in the pathogenesis of Huntington's disease. Using a transgenic mouse model of Huntington's disease, we examined the interaction between the SEACAT complex and mutant huntingtin protein. Our findings revealed that the SEACAT complex is upregulated in the striatum of Huntington's disease mice, suggesting a potential involvement in disease progression. Furthermore, we identified small molecule inhibitors that selectively target the SEACAT complex, leading to amelioration of motor deficits and neuropathology in the experimental mice. These results demonstrate the potential of targeting the SEACAT complex as a novel therapeutic approach for Huntington's disease.
