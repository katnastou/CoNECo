prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: RNAPIIs. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The RNAPIIs protein complex is an essential component of the transcriptional machinery in eukaryotic cells. Dysregulation of RNAPIIs function has been implicated in various diseases, including cancer and neurodegenerative disorders. Recent studies have highlighted the role of small molecule inhibitors in modulating the activity of RNAPIIs, offering potential therapeutic avenues for targeting diseases with dysregulated transcriptional processes. Furthermore, investigations into the interaction between RNAPIIs and specific DNA sequences have provided insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying gene expression regulation. This research has the potential to enhance our understanding of the intricate processes involved in transcription and to uncover novel targets for therapeutic intervention in disease states.
