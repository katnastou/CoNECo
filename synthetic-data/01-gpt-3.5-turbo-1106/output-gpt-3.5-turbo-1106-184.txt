prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: TriC. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we investigated the role of the protein complex TriC in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease. We conducted experiments using a mouse model of Parkinson's disease and observed a significant upregulation of TriC expression in the substantia nigra, a key region affected in the disease. Furthermore, treatment with a neuroprotective agent resulted in the downregulation of TriC expression and a corresponding improvement in motor function in the mice. Our findings suggest that TriC may play a crucial role in the neurodegenerative processes underlying Parkinson's disease and may serve as a potential therapeutic target for intervention. These results provide valuable insights into the molecular mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease and may lead to the development of novel treatment strategies targeting the TriC complex.
