prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: CKII. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we investigated the role of the protein complex CKII in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease. Using a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease, we observed a significant upregulation of CKII activity in the affected brain tissue compared to the control group. Furthermore, treatment with a small molecule inhibitor of CKII led to a marked reduction in amyloid beta plaque formation and improved cognitive function in the mice. These findings suggest that CKII may play a critical role in the progression of Alzheimer's disease and targeting this protein complex could be a potential therapeutic strategy for the treatment of this devastating neurological disorder.
