prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: apoptosomes. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The role of apoptosomes in regulating cellular apoptosis has been the subject of extensive investigation in recent years. Apoptosis, or programmed cell death, plays a crucial role in various physiological processes and is dysregulated in many disease states, including cancer and neurodegenerative disorders. The assembly of apoptosomes is triggered by the release of cytochrome c from the mitochondria, which then activates caspase-9 leading to the initiation of the apoptotic cascade. A number of small molecule compounds have been identified that specifically target apoptosomes, offering potential therapeutic avenues for the treatment of diseases characterized by dysregulated apoptosis. Further understanding of the molecular mechanisms governing apoptosome function may pave the way for the development of novel approaches to modulate cell death pathways for therapeutic benefit.
