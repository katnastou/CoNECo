prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: spectrin. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we investigated the interaction between spectrin and erythrocyte membrane proteins. Using mass spectrometry, we identified several proteins that directly interact with spectrin, including ankyrin and actin. Furthermore, we found that mutations in the gene encoding spectrin led to alterations in erythrocyte membrane integrity, resulting in hereditary spherocytosis. We also observed a decrease in spectrin levels in individuals with malaria, suggesting a potential role for spectrin in the pathophysiology of this disease. Our findings shed light on the critical role of spectrin in maintaining erythrocyte structure and function, with implications for understanding and treating various hematological disorders.
