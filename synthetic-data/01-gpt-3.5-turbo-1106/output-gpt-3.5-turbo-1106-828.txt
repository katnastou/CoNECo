prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: AHAS III. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: A key component involved in the metabolic pathway of branched-chain amino acid biosynthesis is the AHAS III protein complex. This complex plays a critical role in the feedback regulation of isoleucine and valine biosynthesis in plants. Mutations in AHAS III have been implicated in herbicide resistance in certain weed species, posing significant challenges to agricultural crop production. Recent studies have also linked dysregulation of AHAS III to the development of neurologic complications in individuals with maple syrup urine disease, a rare genetic disorder impacting branched-chain amino acid metabolism. Further investigation into the molecular mechanisms underlying AHAS III function and regulation may offer valuable insights for developing novel strategies to address herbicide resistance and combat the pathophysiology of related metabolic disorders.
