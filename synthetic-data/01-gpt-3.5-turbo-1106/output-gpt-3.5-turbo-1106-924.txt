prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: AHA II. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The role of AHA II in the pathogenesis of coronary artery disease has been an area of intense investigation in recent years. AHA II is believed to play a critical role in the regulation of vascular endothelial function and arterial health. Studies have shown that AHA II expression is upregulated in atherosclerotic lesions, suggesting a potential association with the progression of atherosclerosis. Additionally, AHA II has been implicated in the modulation of inflammatory processes within the vascular wall, further linking its activity to the development and progression of coronary artery disease. Understanding the mechanistic involvement of AHA II in these processes may provide potential therapeutic targets for the management and treatment of coronary artery disease.
