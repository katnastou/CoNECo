prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: ubiquinol oxidase. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, the impact of ubiquinol oxidase on skeletal muscle function in a mouse model was investigated. Mice lacking the expression of ubiquinol oxidase exhibited reduced muscle strength and endurance compared to wild-type mice. Interestingly, the administration of an antioxidant compound resulted in partial restoration of muscle function in the knockout mice. These findings suggest a potential role for ubiquinol oxidase in modulating oxidative stress and muscle performance. Further exploration of the molecular mechanisms underlying the function of ubiquinol oxidase may provide insights into therapeutic strategies for addressing muscle-related disorders associated with oxidative damage.
