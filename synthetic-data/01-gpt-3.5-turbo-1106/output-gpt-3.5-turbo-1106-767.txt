prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: RNApIIs. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we investigated the effect of a novel small molecule inhibitor on the activity of RNA polymerase II elongation complex, termed RNApIIs, in breast cancer cells. Our results showed that treatment with the inhibitor led to a significant reduction in RNApIIs activity, as evidenced by decreased levels of mRNA transcripts for key oncogenes involved in breast cancer progression. Furthermore, we observed a concomitant decrease in cell proliferation and an increase in apoptosis in the treated cells. These findings suggest that targeting RNApIIs could be a promising approach for the development of anti-cancer therapies, particularly in breast cancer. Overall, our results provide valuable insights into the potential role of RNApIIs in breast cancer pathogenesis and highlight its suitability as a therapeutic target in this disease.
