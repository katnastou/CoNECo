prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: protein-cysteine S-palmitoyltransferase. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The protein-cysteine S-palmitoyltransferase (PCYSPT) is a key enzyme involved in the palmitoylation of proteins, a reversible lipid modification that plays a crucial role in various cellular processes. Dysregulation of palmitoylation has been implicated in several human diseases, including neurodegenerative disorders and cancer. In a recent study, the effects of PCYSPT inhibitors on the progression of Alzheimer's disease were investigated using a transgenic mouse model. The findings revealed a significant reduction in the accumulation of amyloid-beta plaques and improvement in cognitive function upon treatment with the PCYSPT inhibitor. This highlights the potential of targeting PCYSPT as a therapeutic strategy for Alzheimer's disease and warrants further exploration into the mechanism of action and potential off-target effects of PCYSPT inhibition.
