prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: quinol-fumarate reductase respiratory. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we investigated the role of the quinol-fumarate reductase respiratory complex in the pathogenesis of colorectal cancer. Our results demonstrate that increased expression of the quinol-fumarate reductase respiratory complex is associated with tumor progression and metastasis in colorectal cancer patients. Furthermore, we found that inhibition of the quinol-fumarate reductase respiratory complex using specific small molecule inhibitors led to a significant reduction in tumor growth and metastatic spread in preclinical models. These findings suggest a potential therapeutic strategy targeting the quinol-fumarate reductase respiratory complex for the treatment of colorectal cancer. This study sheds light on the role of the quinol-fumarate reductase respiratory complex in cancer biology and highlights its potential as a target for novel anticancer therapies.
