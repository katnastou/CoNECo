prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: alphav-beta5 integrin. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The alphav-beta5 integrin protein complex has recently emerged as a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer. In a study conducted on a murine model, administration of the small molecule inhibitor E7820 led to a significant reduction in tumor burden and metastasis in mice with advanced breast cancer. Furthermore, analysis of patient samples revealed an upregulation of alphav-beta5 integrin expression in metastatic lesions compared to primary tumors, suggesting a potential role in disease progression. These findings highlight the therapeutic potential of targeting the alphav-beta5 integrin complex in the management of metastatic breast cancer and warrant further investigation into its mechanistic role in disease pathogenesis.
