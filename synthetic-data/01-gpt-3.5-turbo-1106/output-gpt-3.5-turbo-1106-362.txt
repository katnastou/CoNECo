prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: polyribosomes. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: Recent research has shed light on the regulatory mechanism of protein translation in eukaryotic cells. Of particular interest is the role of polyribosomes, the complex formed by multiple ribosomes simultaneously translating a single mRNA molecule. It has been demonstrated that the formation and dynamics of polyribosomes are tightly regulated, with important implications for cellular homeostasis and disease pathogenesis. A deeper understanding of the molecular mechanisms governing the assembly and disassembly of polyribosomes has the potential to uncover novel therapeutic targets for diseases associated with dysregulated protein synthesis, such as cancer and neurodegenerative disorders. This emerging field of study holds promise for the development of interventions aimed at modulating polyribosome function to restore normal cellular protein synthesis and mitigate disease progression.
