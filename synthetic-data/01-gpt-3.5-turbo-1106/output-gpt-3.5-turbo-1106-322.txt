prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: GARP. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The Golgi-associated retrograde protein (GARP) complex plays a crucial role in intracellular trafficking and sorting of various biomolecules within eukaryotic cells. This complex comprises four distinct subunits, namely VPS52, VPS53, VPS54, and VPS51, and is involved in the retrograde transport of TGN-derived vesicles carrying cargo to endosomes and lysosomes. GARP has been implicated in the pathogenesis of certain hereditary disorders, including Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome, wherein defects in lysosomal function and biogenesis lead to debilitating multi-organ dysfunction. Recent studies have revealed potential therapeutic targets to modulate GARP-mediated vesicular trafficking, offering promise for the development of novel interventions for lysosomal storage diseases and other related disorders. Further investigation into the molecular mechanisms governing GARP function will undoubtedly shed light on its role in health and disease, paving the way for innovative treatments in the realm of cellular and molecular biology.
