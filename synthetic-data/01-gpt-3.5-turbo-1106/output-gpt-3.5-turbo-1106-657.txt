prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: CENP-A containing nucleosomes. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The role of CENP-A containing nucleosomes in the progression of breast cancer has been a topic of significant interest in recent studies. Utilizing in vitro and in vivo models, researchers have investigated the interactions between CENP-A containing nucleosomes and BRCA1 in malignant breast tissue. The findings suggest that aberrant CENP-A expression correlates with increased tumor growth and invasive potential in breast cancer cells, highlighting the potential of CENP-A containing nucleosomes as a prognostic marker for breast cancer progression. Additionally, the identification of specific regulatory pathways involving CENP-A containing nucleosomes may provide novel therapeutic targets for the treatment of aggressive breast cancer subtypes. These results contribute to the growing understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying breast cancer pathogenesis and may inform future targeted therapeutic strategies.
