prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: 90S preribosome. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we investigated the role of the 90S preribosome complex in the pathogenesis of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). Using a series of immunoprecipitation assays, we identified several novel interacting partners of the 90S preribosome complex, including specific small nucleolar RNAs and ribosomal proteins. Furthermore, we observed dysregulation of the 90S preribosome complex in bone marrow samples from MDS patients compared to healthy controls, suggesting a potential link between aberrant ribosome biogenesis and the development of MDS. Our findings shed light on the intricate molecular mechanisms underlying MDS pathology and provide new insights into the role of the 90S preribosome complex in this disease.
