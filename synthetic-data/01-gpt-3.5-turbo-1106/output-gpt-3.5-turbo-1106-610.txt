prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: YdcSTUV ABC transporter. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we investigated the role of the YdcSTUV ABC transporter protein complex in the pathogenesis of Clostridium difficile infections. We examined the expression patterns of the YdcSTUV ABC transporter in both clinical isolates and laboratory strains of C. difficile. Our results revealed a significant upregulation of the YdcSTUV ABC transporter in strains associated with recurrent C. difficile infections compared to non-recurrent strains. Furthermore, we observed that mutant strains lacking the functional YdcSTUV ABC transporter exhibited reduced virulence in a murine model of C. difficile infection. These findings suggest that the YdcSTUV ABC transporter may play a crucial role in the pathogenicity of C. difficile and could serve as a potential target for the development of novel therapeutic interventions.
