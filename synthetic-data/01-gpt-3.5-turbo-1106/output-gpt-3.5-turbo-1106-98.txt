prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: histone deacetylases. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: Histone deacetylases (HDACs) have been the subject of extensive investigation in the field of oncology due to their potential role in the regulation of cell proliferation and differentiation. A study on breast cancer patients revealed a significant correlation between high HDAC expression and cancer aggressiveness. Moreover, the use of HDAC inhibitors has shown promise in preclinical studies as a potential therapeutic approach for various cancer types. Recent research has also suggested a connection between HDAC dysregulation and neurodegenerative diseases, highlighting the potential significance of this protein complex in the pathogenesis of such disorders. The development of selective HDAC inhibitors and their evaluation in clinical trials holds great promise for the treatment of both cancer and neurodegenerative diseases.
