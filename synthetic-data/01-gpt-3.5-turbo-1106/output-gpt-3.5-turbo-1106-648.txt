prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: glyRS. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: Recent studies have shed light on the role of the glyRS protein complex in the pathogenesis of fibrotic liver diseases. Activation of glyRS has been shown to promote hepatic stellate cell activation and extracellular matrix deposition, leading to the progression of liver fibrosis. Inhibition of glyRS activity has been proposed as a potential therapeutic strategy to mitigate fibrogenesis and ameliorate liver fibrosis. Furthermore, the upregulation of glyRS expression has been observed in patients with nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, suggesting a potential association between glyRS and the progression of this disease. These findings underscore the significance of glyRS as a potential target for the development of novel treatments for fibrotic liver diseases.
