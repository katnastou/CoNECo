prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: U body. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The U body is a well-characterized subnuclear structure that has been implicated in the RNA surveillance pathway. Recent studies have demonstrated that the U body is dynamically regulated in response to cellular stress, with its size and composition changing in a context-dependent manner. Furthermore, the U body has been found to interact with a variety of RNA-binding proteins, suggesting a role in the quality control of RNA processing and degradation. The association of the U body with neurodegenerative diseases, such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, underscores its potential relevance in the pathogenesis of these disorders. Overall, the U body represents a critical hub for RNA metabolism and may serve as a promising target for therapeutic interventions aimed at modulating cellular stress responses.
