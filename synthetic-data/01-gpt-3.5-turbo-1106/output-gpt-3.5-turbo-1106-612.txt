prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: respiratory chain complex III. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The respiratory chain complex III plays a crucial role in the mitochondrial electron transport chain, where it mediates the transfer of electrons from coenzyme Q to cytochrome c. Dysfunction of respiratory chain complex III has been associated with several mitochondrial disorders, including mitochondrial encephalomyopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episodes (MELAS) syndrome. Additionally, the respiratory chain complex III has been implicated in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's disease, where impaired electron transport within the complex may contribute to mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress. Understanding the structure and function of respiratory chain complex III is essential for elucidating the molecular basis of these diseases and the development of targeted therapies to mitigate their effects.
