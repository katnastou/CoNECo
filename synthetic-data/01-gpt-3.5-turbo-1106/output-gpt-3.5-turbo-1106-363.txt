prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: ThiGHs. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we aimed to elucidate the potential role of the ThiGHs protein complex in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative disorders. We conducted a comprehensive analysis of post-mortem brain tissue samples from patients with Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and age-matched controls. We observed a significant upregulation of ThiGHs in the affected brain regions of patients with neurodegenerative disorders, suggesting a potential involvement of this protein complex in the underlying molecular mechanisms. Further investigation of ThiGHs in cellular and animal models of neurodegeneration is warranted to uncover its specific functional implications and to explore its potential as a therapeutic target for these debilitating diseases.
