prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: RPA. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In recent years, the role of the single-stranded DNA-binding protein complex RPA in cancer development has garnered significant attention. Studies have revealed that RPA exhibits a crucial function in maintaining genomic stability and repairing DNA damage. Moreover, dysregulation of RPA has been associated with various cancer types, including breast cancer and colorectal cancer. The interaction between RPA and certain DNA repair enzymes, such as the MutS homolog 2 (MSH2) protein, has been shown to be dysregulated in cancer cells, leading to impaired DNA repair processes. Understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying the involvement of RPA in tumorigenesis may provide valuable insights for the development of novel targeted therapies for cancer treatment.
