prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: laminin-6. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In the present study, our investigation focused on the role of laminin-6 in the pathogenesis of diabetic nephropathy, a common complication of diabetes mellitus. We sought to elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying the interaction of laminin-6 with endothelial cells, and its impact on the development and progression of diabetic kidney disease. Utilizing a murine model of diabetes, we observed a significant upregulation of laminin-6 expression in the glomerular basement membrane, concurrent with the onset of albuminuria and renal fibrosis. In addition, our findings revealed a correlation between increased laminin-6 levels and vascular permeability, suggesting a potential involvement of this protein complex in the pathophysiology of diabetic nephropathy. These results underscore the importance of further exploring the functional significance of laminin-6 in the context of diabetic kidney complications, with implications for the development of novel therapeutic strategies targeting this extracellular matrix component.
