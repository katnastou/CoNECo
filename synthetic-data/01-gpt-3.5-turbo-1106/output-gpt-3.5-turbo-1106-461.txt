prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: PheRSs. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: This study investigated the role of the PheRSs protein complex in the regulation of protein translation. Utilizing a murine model, we observed that the absence of functional PheRSs led to an aberrant phenotypic presentation, characterized by growth retardation and impaired metabolism. Furthermore, our findings suggest a potential link between PheRSs dysfunction and the development of metabolic disorders, including insulin resistance and dyslipidemia. Consequently, targeting PheRSs activity may hold therapeutic potential for addressing metabolic dysregulation and associated pathologies. Our work highlights the importance of understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying PheRSs function in the context of metabolic homeostasis.
