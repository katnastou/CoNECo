prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: cytosolic large ribosomal subunit. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we investigated the role of the cytosolic large ribosomal subunit in the pathogenesis of prostate cancer. Utilizing a murine model, we observed a dysregulation of this protein complex in cancerous tissues compared to normal prostate tissue. Furthermore, we found that targeting the cytosolic large ribosomal subunit using a novel small molecule inhibitor led to a reduction in tumor growth and metastasis in vivo. Our findings suggest that the cytosolic large ribosomal subunit may serve as a potential therapeutic target for prostate cancer and warrant further exploration in clinical settings for the development of new treatment strategies.
