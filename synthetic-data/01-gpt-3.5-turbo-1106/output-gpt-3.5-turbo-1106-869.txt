prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: VLA-4. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The VLA-4 protein complex has been of great interest in the field of immunology due to its critical role in the pathogenesis of multiple sclerosis. Previous studies have demonstrated the involvement of VLA-4 in the adhesion of leukocytes to endothelial cells, facilitating their migration across the blood-brain barrier and subsequent infiltration into the central nervous system. Inhibition of VLA-4 has shown promising results in preclinical models of multiple sclerosis, leading to reduced disease severity and attenuated neuroinflammation. Furthermore, small molecule inhibitors targeting VLA-4 have been developed and are currently under investigation for their efficacy and safety in clinical trials for the treatment of multiple sclerosis. The potential of VLA-4 as a therapeutic target in multiple sclerosis has sparked the exploration of novel drug candidates and the development of precision medicine strategies aimed at modulating the activity of this crucial protein complex in the context of autoimmune diseases.
