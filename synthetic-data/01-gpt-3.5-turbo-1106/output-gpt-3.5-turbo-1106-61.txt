prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: HDAC3. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we aimed to investigate the effects of a novel HDAC3 inhibitor on cellular proliferation and apoptosis in breast cancer cell lines. Our results revealed that treatment with the HDAC3 inhibitor led to a significant reduction in cell viability and an increase in apoptotic cell death. Furthermore, we observed a downregulation of key cell cycle regulators, such as cyclin D1 and CDK4, following HDAC3 inhibition. Importantly, our findings also demonstrated that the HDAC3 inhibitor suppressed the expression of anti-apoptotic proteins, including Bcl-2, and increased the levels of cleaved caspase-3, underlying its pro-apoptotic effects. Overall, our study highlights the potential of targeting HDAC3 as a promising strategy for the treatment of breast cancer.
