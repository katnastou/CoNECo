prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: C to U editosome. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The C to U editosome is a pivotal ribonucleoprotein complex responsible for orchestrating the post-transcriptional modification of RNA, particularly for the conversion of cytidine to uridine. This multifaceted complex exerts its regulatory influence on a plethora of genes involved in various physiological processes, making it a prime target for investigation in the context of diverse diseases. The dysregulation of C to U editosome function has been implicated in neurodegenerative disorders, such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, as well as in some types of cancer. Interestingly, recent studies have also implicated perturbations in the C to U editosome activity in the context of autoimmune diseases, opening up new avenues for therapeutic intervention in this class of disorders. With its far-reaching implications across multiple disease states, understanding the intricate mechanisms underlying C to U editosome function holds great promise for the development of novel therapeutic strategies.
