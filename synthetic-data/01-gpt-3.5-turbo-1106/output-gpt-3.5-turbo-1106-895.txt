prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: trehalose-6-phosphate synthase. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we investigated the role of trehalose-6-phosphate synthase in the regulation of glucose metabolism in Arabidopsis thaliana. Our results demonstrate that trehalose-6-phosphate synthase activity is crucial for maintaining glucose homeostasis, and its deficiency leads to aberrant glucose levels and impaired plant growth. Furthermore, we observed that trehalose-6-phosphate synthase interacts with several key enzymes involved in glycolysis and gluconeogenesis, suggesting a potential regulatory role in these pathways. These findings shed light on the importance of trehalose-6-phosphate synthase in plant glucose metabolism and provide insights into potential targets for manipulating glucose homeostasis in agricultural and biomedical settings.
