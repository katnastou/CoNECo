prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: chaperonin-containing T-complex. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In recent years, the chaperonin-containing T-complex has emerged as a key player in the cellular machinery governing protein folding and assembly. This protein complex, comprising the chaperonin T-complex 1 (CCT) subunits, has been implicated in the proper folding of various client proteins, including those involved in cytoskeletal organization and cell division. Dysfunction of the chaperonin-containing T-complex has been linked to a range of human diseases, such as neurodegenerative disorders and cancer. Given its central role in maintaining proteostasis, efforts to understand the molecular mechanisms underlying the function of the chaperonin-containing T-complex hold great promise for the development of therapeutic strategies targeting protein folding disorders.
