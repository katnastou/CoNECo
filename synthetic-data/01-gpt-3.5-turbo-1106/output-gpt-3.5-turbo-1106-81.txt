prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: phosphoinositide 3-kinase complex, class III. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we investigated the role of the phosphoinositide 3-kinase complex, class III (PI3KC3) in the regulation of autophagy in a rat model of Parkinson's disease. Our findings demonstrate that PI3KC3 activity is crucial for the induction of autophagy in dopaminergic neurons, providing a potential target for therapeutic interventions in Parkinson's disease. Furthermore, we observed an increase in the levels of Beclin-1, a key regulator of autophagosome formation, and a decrease in the levels of p62, a selective autophagy substrate, upon activation of PI3KC3. These results suggest that modulating PI3KC3 function may offer a promising avenue for the development of novel treatments for neurodegenerative diseases characterized by impaired autophagy.
