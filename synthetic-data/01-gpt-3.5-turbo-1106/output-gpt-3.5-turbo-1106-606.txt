prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: VBC. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) tumor suppressor protein is known to be a critical component of the VBC complex. Dysregulation of the VBC complex has been implicated in the development of various cancers, including clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC). Recent studies have provided insights into the interaction between the VBC complex and hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs), revealing potential therapeutic targets for managing VBC complex-related malignancies. Moreover, small molecule modulators of the VBC complex have shown promise in preclinical models, suggesting a potential avenue for drug development in the treatment of VBC-associated malignancies. This research underscores the significance of investigating the VBC complex as a potential target for precision medicine approaches in the management of VBC-related cancers.
