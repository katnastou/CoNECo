prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: CDL2. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: A recent study aimed to investigate the role of the CDL2 protein complex in the pathogenesis of colorectal cancer (CRC). Through a combination of bioinformatics analysis and experimental validation, the research team found that the upregulation of CDL2 was significantly associated with advanced stages of CRC and poor patient prognosis. Moreover, the study revealed a potential cross-talk between CDL2 and known oncogenic signaling pathways, such as the Wnt signaling pathway, suggesting a potential regulatory role for CDL2 in promoting CRC progression. Further functional studies using CRC cell line models demonstrated that CDL2 depletion led to a significant reduction in cell proliferation and invasion, highlighting the potential of targeting CDL2 as a therapeutic strategy for CRC. Overall, these findings shed light on the significance of the CDL2 protein complex in CRC and provide a promising avenue for the development of novel targeted therapies for this deadly disease.
