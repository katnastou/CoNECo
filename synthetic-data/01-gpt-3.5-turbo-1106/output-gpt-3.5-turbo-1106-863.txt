prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: isoamylases. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: Recent research has expanded our understanding of the regulatory mechanisms involved in starch metabolism. In particular, the isoamylases have garnered significant attention due to their pivotal role in modulating starch structure and metabolism. The discovery of novel regulatory factors and environmental stimuli that impact isoamylase activity has provided insights into the complex interplay between enzymatic activities and starch synthesis. Moreover, the investigation of isoamylases in the context of metabolic disorders such as glycogen storage diseases has unveiled potential therapeutic targets for the amelioration of these conditions. This growing body of evidence underscores the importance of further exploring the multifaceted functions of isoamylases in health and disease.
