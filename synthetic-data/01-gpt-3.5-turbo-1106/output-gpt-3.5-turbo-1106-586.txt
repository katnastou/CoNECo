prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: extracellular ferritins. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we elucidate the role of extracellular ferritins in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease. By employing molecular techniques, we demonstrated a significant upregulation of extracellular ferritins in the brain tissues of Alzheimer's disease patients compared to age-matched controls. Interestingly, our findings revealed a positive correlation between extracellular ferritins levels and the deposition of amyloid-beta plaques, a hallmark feature of Alzheimer's disease. Furthermore, in vitro experiments using neuronal cell cultures demonstrated that extracellular ferritins induce oxidative stress and impair cellular viability. These results highlight the potential of extracellular ferritins as a novel therapeutic target for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease and provide insight into the underlying mechanisms of disease progression.
