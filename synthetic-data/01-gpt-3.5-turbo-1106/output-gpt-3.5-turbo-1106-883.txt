prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: ATCase. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The aspartate transcarbamoylase (ATCase) complex plays a critical role in the regulation of pyrimidine biosynthesis in various organisms. In recent studies, the allosteric regulation of ATCase has been shown to be a potential target for therapeutic intervention in diseases such as cancer and microbial infections. The enzymatic activity of ATCase is modulated by interactions with small molecule effectors, such as CTP and ATP, which serve as feedback inhibitors. Furthermore, the structural elucidation of ATCase has provided valuable insights into the rational design of small molecule inhibitors with potential anti-cancer and antimicrobial activity. Understanding the intricate regulatory mechanisms of ATCase offers promising avenues for the development of novel therapeutic strategies targeting pyrimidine biosynthesis in disease contexts.
