prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: clathrin. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The clathrin protein complex plays a critical role in the process of endocytosis, which is essential for the internalization of various ligands, nutrients, and cellular components. Dysregulation of clathrin-mediated endocytosis has been implicated in the pathogenesis of various diseases, including neurodegenerative disorders and certain viral infections. In addition to its role in endocytosis, clathrin has been shown to interact with a range of adaptor proteins, such as AP-2, and auxiliary factors, including dynamin, to facilitate efficient vesicle formation and budding. Furthermore, clathrin-mediated endocytosis has been recognized as a potential target for therapeutic intervention in diseases associated with aberrant receptor trafficking and signaling. Understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying clathrin-mediated endocytosis may provide valuable insights for the development of novel strategies to modulate cellular processes and combat disease.
