prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: high-density lipoprotein particles. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In the present study, we sought to investigate the impact of dietary polyphenols on the composition and function of high-density lipoprotein particles. Our results demonstrate that the consumption of polyphenol-rich foods, such as berries and green tea, led to a significant increase in the levels of high-density lipoprotein particles in a murine model of atherosclerosis. Furthermore, we observed a striking improvement in the ability of high-density lipoprotein particles to mediate cholesterol efflux from macrophages, suggesting a potential mechanism underlying the cardioprotective effects of polyphenols. These findings provide novel insights into the role of dietary polyphenols in modulating high-density lipoprotein particle biology and offer potential therapeutic implications for the management of cardiovascular diseases.
