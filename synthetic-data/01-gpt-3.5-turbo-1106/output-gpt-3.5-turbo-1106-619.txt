prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: BtuCDF. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The transport of vitamin B12 across the inner membrane of bacteria has been shown to be mediated by the BtuCDF protein complex. Recent studies have reported that the absence of BtuCDF leads to a significant reduction in the intracellular concentration of vitamin B12 in Escherichia coli. Additionally, research has suggested that the BtuCDF complex may have a critical role in the survival and pathogenesis of certain bacterial species. Understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying the function of the BtuCDF complex may offer new avenues for the development of antimicrobial agents targeting vitamin B12 transport in bacterial pathogens, with potential implications for the treatment of infectious diseases.
