prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: primary cell wall CESA. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: This study aimed to investigate the potential role of the primary cell wall CESA complex in the development of pathogenic resistance in Arabidopsis thaliana. Through a combination of genetic and biochemical approaches, we found that the primary cell wall CESA complex plays a critical role in regulating the synthesis of cellulose in response to infection by the fungal pathogen Botrytis cinerea. Our results suggest that the primary cell wall CESA complex may serve as a key modulator of cell wall integrity and defense responses in plants. Furthermore, our findings shed light on the intricate interplay between the primary cell wall CESA complex, cellulose biosynthesis, and plant immunity, providing valuable insights into potential strategies for enhancing disease resistance in agricultural crops.
