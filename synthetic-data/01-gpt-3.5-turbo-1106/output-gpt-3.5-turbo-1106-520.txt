prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: PaoABC periplasmic aldehyde oxidoreductase. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we investigate the role of PaoABC periplasmic aldehyde oxidoreductase in the pathogenesis of liver disease. Using a mouse model of alcoholic liver disease, we found that the expression of PaoABC periplasmic aldehyde oxidoreductase was significantly upregulated in the liver tissues of the affected animals. Furthermore, we observed a positive correlation between PaoABC expression and the severity of liver damage, as evidenced by elevated levels of liver enzymes and histological evidence of steatosis and inflammation. Our findings suggest that PaoABC periplasmic aldehyde oxidoreductase may play a critical role in the development and progression of alcoholic liver disease and could serve as a potential therapeutic target for this condition.
