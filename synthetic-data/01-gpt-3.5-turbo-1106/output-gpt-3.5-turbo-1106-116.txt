prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: CydDC. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The role of the CydDC protein complex in bacterial physiology has been elucidated in several studies. For example, it has been shown that CydDC is involved in the transport of cytochrome bd, which is known to promote bacterial survival under low-oxygen conditions. Additionally, the absence of CydDC has been linked to increased susceptibility to certain antibacterial compounds, highlighting the significance of this protein complex in antimicrobial resistance. Further investigation into the regulation and function of CydDC could provide valuable insights into strategies for combating bacterial infections and developing novel antimicrobial therapies.
