prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: mannan polymerase. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we investigated the involvement of the mannan polymerase complex in the etiology of fungal infections. Our results demonstrate a direct association between the activity of mannan polymerase and the pathogenicity of Candida albicans, highlighting its potential significance in the virulence of this opportunistic pathogen. We also observed a different pattern of expression for the mannan polymerase complex in the presence of antifungal agents, suggesting a potential role in drug resistance mechanisms. Furthermore, our findings indicated a correlation between the expression levels of mannan polymerase and the severity of candidiasis in a murine model, supporting its potential as a therapeutic target for the treatment of invasive fungal infections. This study provides valuable insights into the role of the mannan polymerase complex in fungal pathogenesis and opens new avenues for the development of novel antifungal strategies.
