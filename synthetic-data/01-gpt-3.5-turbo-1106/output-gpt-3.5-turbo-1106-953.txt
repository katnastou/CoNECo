prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: ATP-utilizing chromatin assembly and remodeling factor. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we investigated the role of the ATP-utilizing chromatin assembly and remodeling factor (ACF) in the progression of colorectal cancer. Utilizing a cohort of colorectal cancer patients, we observed a significant upregulation of ACF expression in tumor tissue compared to adjacent normal tissue. Furthermore, we identified a positive correlation between ACF expression levels and tumor size as well as disease stage. Mechanistic studies revealed that ACF promotes tumor cell proliferation through its interaction with epigenetic regulators, leading to aberrant chromatin remodeling and dysregulation of key oncogenes. Additionally, pharmacological inhibition of ACF resulted in a significant reduction in tumor growth in xenograft models. Taken together, our findings suggest that ACF may serve as a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of colorectal cancer.
