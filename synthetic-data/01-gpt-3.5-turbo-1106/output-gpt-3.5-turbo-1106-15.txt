prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: elongator holoenzyme. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The elongator holoenzyme is a multi-subunit complex involved in the regulation of transcription and chromatin remodeling. Recent studies have implicated the elongator holoenzyme in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative disorders, such as Alzheimer's disease and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Additionally, the activity of the elongator holoenzyme has been linked to the modification of tRNAs, potentially impacting translation fidelity. The complex interplay between the elongator holoenzyme and cellular processes underscores its importance in maintaining proper cellular function. Further investigation into the role of the elongator holoenzyme in disease pathology may offer new insights for therapeutic interventions targeting neurodegenerative conditions.
