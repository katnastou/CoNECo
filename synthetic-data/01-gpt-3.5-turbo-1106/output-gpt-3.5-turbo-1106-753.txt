prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: BORC. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In recent years, significant progress has been made in elucidating the role of the BORC (Biogenesis of Lysosome-Related Organelles Complex) in cellular physiology. BORC has been shown to play a pivotal role in the regulation of lysosome-related organelle biogenesis and trafficking. Studies have revealed that BORC interacts with various small GTPases and other regulatory factors to modulate membrane dynamics and cargo sorting within the endolysosomal system. Dysregulation of BORC function has been implicated in several human diseases, including lysosomal storage disorders and neurodegenerative conditions. Understanding the molecular mechanisms governing BORC activity may offer unique insights into the pathophysiology of these disorders and provide potential targets for therapeutic intervention. Further research into the precise functions of BORC in cellular homeostasis and disease states is warranted to fully appreciate its therapeutic implications.
