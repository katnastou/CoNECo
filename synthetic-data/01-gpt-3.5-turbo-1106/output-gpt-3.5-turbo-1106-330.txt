prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: PA700-dependent proteasome activator. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The PA700-dependent proteasome activator is a crucial regulatory component involved in the degradation of damaged or misfolded proteins within the cell. Dysregulation of the proteasome system has been implicated in various human diseases, including neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease. Recent studies have highlighted the potential therapeutic implications of modulating the activity of PA700-dependent proteasome activator in mitigating the progression of such conditions. Furthermore, the identification of small molecules that target the proteasome activator complex represents an exciting avenue for drug development in the field of neurodegenerative diseases. Understanding the intricate regulatory mechanisms governing the function of the PA700-dependent proteasome activator holds promise for the development of novel therapeutic interventions targeting protein misfolding and accumulation in neurodegenerative disorders.
