prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: CRL. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The ubiquitin-proteasome system plays a critical role in regulating cellular homeostasis and protein turnover. Cullin-RING ligases (CRLs) are a well-characterized family of multisubunit E3 ubiquitin ligases that have been implicated in various cellular processes, including cell cycle control, DNA replication, and signal transduction. Dysregulation of CRLs has been associated with a range of human diseases, such as cancer and neurodegenerative disorders. Recent studies have uncovered the potential of small molecule modulators to alter the activity of CRLs, highlighting their potential as therapeutic targets for the treatment of certain diseases. Further investigation into the regulatory mechanisms and substrate specificity of CRLs may provide valuable insights into their physiological function and offer new avenues for therapeutic intervention.
