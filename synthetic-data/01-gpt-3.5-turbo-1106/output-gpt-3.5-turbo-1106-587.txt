prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: SSR. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In recent years, researchers have become increasingly interested in the role of the SSR protein complex in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases, particularly Alzheimer's disease. Studies have demonstrated that mutations in genes encoding components of the SSR complex contribute to the development of neurological symptoms characteristic of Alzheimer's disease. Importantly, the dysfunction of the SSR complex has been linked to aberrant protein folding and misfolding events, ultimately leading to the formation of amyloid plaques in the brain. New therapeutic strategies targeting the SSR complex are being investigated to prevent or slow down the progression of Alzheimer's disease, representing a promising avenue for future drug development. Understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying the involvement of the SSR complex in neurodegeneration may provide crucial insights for the development of effective treatments for Alzheimer's disease.
