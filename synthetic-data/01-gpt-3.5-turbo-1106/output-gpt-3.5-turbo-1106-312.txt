prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: box H/ACA small nucleolar ribonucleoprotein. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The box H/ACA small nucleolar ribonucleoprotein (snoRNP) complex is an essential player in the biogenesis of ribosomal RNA (rRNA) and small nuclear RNAs (snRNAs). Recent studies have revealed the critical role of the snoRNP complex in the regulation of cellular proliferation and in the pathogenesis of various cancers. Dysfunction of the snoRNP complex has been implicated in the development of several ribosomopathies, such as Diamond-Blackfan anemia and dyskeratosis congenita. Furthermore, the dysregulation of snoRNP activity has been linked to neurodegenerative disorders, suggesting its involvement in a wide range of human diseases. Understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying the function of the box H/ACA snoRNP complex could provide valuable insights for therapeutic interventions targeting these diseases.
