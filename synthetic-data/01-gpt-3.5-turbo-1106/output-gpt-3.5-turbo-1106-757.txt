model: gpt-3.5-turbo-1106
prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: Pol-zeta4. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: A critical factor in maintaining genomic stability is the error-prone DNA polymerase zeta (Pol Î¶), which is responsible for translesion DNA synthesis. This complex consists of the Rev7 subunit and the Rev3-Rev7 dimer, and plays a crucial role in bypassing DNA lesions during replication. Recent studies have identified a novel variant of this complex, termed Pol-zeta4, which includes the Rev1-Rev7-Rev3-Rev7 tetramer structure. The Pol-zeta4 complex has been implicated in the process of mutagenesis and is closely associated with the development of various cancer types. Furthermore, dysregulation of Pol-zeta4 has been linked to heightened DNA damage accumulation and the progression of cancer. Understanding the molecular mechanisms governing the function of Pol-zeta4 may provide valuable insights for the development of targeted therapies aimed at mitigating the detrimental effects of DNA damage-induced mutagenesis in cancer.
