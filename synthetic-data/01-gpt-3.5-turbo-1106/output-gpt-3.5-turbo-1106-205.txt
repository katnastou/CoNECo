prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: DNA polymerase. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we investigate the potential therapeutic effect of a novel small molecule inhibitor on the activity of the DNA polymerase complex. We employed a cell culture model system, treating human fibroblast cells with varying concentrations of the inhibitor and evaluating its impact on the fidelity and efficiency of DNA replication. Our results demonstrate a dose-dependent inhibition of DNA polymerase activity, leading to a decrease in the proliferation rate of the cells. Furthermore, we observed a decrease in the levels of DNA damage and an attenuation of the cellular response to oxidative stress in the presence of the inhibitor. These findings suggest that targeting the DNA polymerase complex with small molecule inhibitors may have potential implications for the treatment of diseases characterized by aberrant DNA replication and repair processes.
