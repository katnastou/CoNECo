prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: IgG2c. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The role of the IgG2c complex in autoimmune diseases has been a subject of intense investigation due to its potential as a therapeutic target. Previous studies have shown that IgG2c levels are significantly elevated in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus and rheumatoid arthritis, suggesting a potential association with disease pathogenesis. Furthermore, experimental models of autoimmune diseases have demonstrated that administration of monoclonal antibodies targeting the IgG2c complex can attenuate disease severity and ameliorate symptoms. These findings suggest that IgG2c may play a crucial role in the development and progression of autoimmune diseases, highlighting its potential as a promising therapeutic target for intervention. Further research into the mechanisms underlying the involvement of IgG2c in autoimmune diseases is warranted to fully elucidate its therapeutic potential.
