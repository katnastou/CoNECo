prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: HslUV protease. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we investigated the role of the HslUV protease in the degradation of misfolded proteins in Escherichia coli. We observed that the absence of HslUV protease activity resulted in an accumulation of misfolded proteins, leading to impaired cell growth and increased susceptibility to proteotoxic stress. Furthermore, we found that chemical induction of HslUV protease expression led to enhanced clearance of misfolded proteins and improved cell viability under conditions of protein misfolding stress. Our findings highlight the crucial role of the HslUV protease in maintaining protein quality control and cellular homeostasis in E. coli, emphasizing its potential as a therapeutic target for combating proteotoxic stress-related diseases.
