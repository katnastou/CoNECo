prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: alpha8-beta1 integrin. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In recent years, studies have implicated the alpha8-beta1 integrin protein complex in various biological processes, including cell migration, tissue development, and wound healing. The interaction of alpha8-beta1 integrin with various extracellular matrix proteins has been shown to play a critical role in regulating cell adhesion and signaling. Moreover, dysregulation of alpha8-beta1 integrin has been associated with several pathological conditions, such as fibrosis and renal injury. Given its involvement in diverse physiological and pathological processes, targeting alpha8-beta1 integrin may hold potential as a therapeutic strategy for diseases characterized by aberrant cell adhesion and tissue remodeling. Further investigation into the molecular mechanisms underlying the function of alpha8-beta1 integrin is warranted to advance our understanding of its role in health and disease.
