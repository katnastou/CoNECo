prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: protein phosphatase 2. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The protein phosphatase 2 complex is a key regulator of cellular signaling pathways, playing a critical role in various biological processes. Dysregulation of this complex has been implicated in several human diseases, including cancer and neurodegenerative disorders. Studies have shown that inhibitors targeting protein phosphatase 2 complex could have therapeutic potential in the treatment of these conditions. Moreover, the complex has been found to interact with various kinases, highlighting its importance in maintaining the balance of phosphorylation and dephosphorylation events within the cell. Further research on the molecular mechanisms underlying the function of protein phosphatase 2 complex is warranted to elucidate its potential as a therapeutic target in disease.
