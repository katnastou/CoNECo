prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: Natural killer cell stimulatory factor. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we investigated the potential role of Natural Killer Cell Stimulatory Factor (NKCSF) in the pathogenesis of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). We observed a significant upregulation of NKCSF expression in the peripheral blood mononuclear cells of SLE patients compared to healthy controls. Furthermore, our findings revealed a positive correlation between NKCSF levels and disease activity as measured by the SLE Disease Activity Index. Additionally, we conducted in vitro experiments using human primary monocytes and observed that stimulation with anti-NKCSF antibodies resulted in enhanced pro-inflammatory cytokine production, suggesting a potential role for NKCSF in modulating immune responses in SLE. Our results highlight NKCSF as a potential therapeutic target for the management of SLE and warrant further investigation into its mechanistic involvement in disease pathology.
