prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: OEC (PSII). Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The oxygen-evolving complex (OEC) is a key structural and functional component of the photosystem II (PSII) complex in plants, algae, and cyanobacteria. The OEC is responsible for the oxidation of water during the light reaction of photosynthesis, generating the oxygen released into the atmosphere. Dysfunction of the OEC has been linked to impaired photosynthetic activity and a range of environmental stress responses in plants, which can impact crop productivity and overall ecosystem health. Understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying the assembly and maintenance of the OEC is crucial for developing strategies to optimize photosynthetic efficiency and mitigate the impact of environmental stressors on agricultural and ecological systems.
