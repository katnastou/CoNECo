prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: Prohibitins. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: A growing body of evidence supports the pivotal role of Prohibitins in various pathophysiological processes, including cancer, aging, and metabolic disorders. Prohibitins are implicated in the regulation of cellular homeostasis and energy metabolism, making them attractive targets for therapeutic intervention. Recent studies have identified a network of interacting partners and signaling pathways that govern the function of Prohibitins. Furthermore, dysregulation of Prohibitins has been associated with the development of several human diseases, emphasizing the need for further investigations into the molecular mechanisms underlying their diverse functions. Understanding the complex interplay between Prohibitins and their associated factors holds promise for the development of novel treatment strategies for a wide array of conditions.
