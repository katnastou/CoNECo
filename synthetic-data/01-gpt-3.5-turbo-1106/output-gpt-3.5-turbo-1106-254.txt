prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: Ferric coprogen receptor. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The Ferric coprogen receptor is a vital transmembrane protein complex present in various pathogenic bacteria, including Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii, and Burkholderia cepacia. This receptor plays a crucial role in bacterial iron acquisition by facilitating the binding and transport of the siderophore coprogen, a high-affinity iron chelator produced by some fungi. Due to its essential role in iron homeostasis, the Ferric coprogen receptor has drawn significant attention as a potential target for the development of novel antimicrobial therapies. Furthermore, its presence in a diverse range of clinically relevant bacterial pathogens underscores the potential significance of targeting this receptor in the treatment of infectious diseases. Understanding the structural and functional characteristics of the Ferric coprogen receptor is paramount for the rational design of tailored therapeutic strategies to combat antibiotic-resistant bacterial infections.
