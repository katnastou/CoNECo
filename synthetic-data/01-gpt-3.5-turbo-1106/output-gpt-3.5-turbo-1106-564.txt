prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: Cis-prenyltransferases. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The cis-prenyltransferases enzyme complex plays a key role in the biosynthesis of isoprenoids, which are essential compounds in various biological processes. Recent studies have shown that mutations in genes encoding cis-prenyltransferases are associated with developmental disorders and neurodegenerative diseases. Additionally, dysregulation of cis-prenyltransferases has been implicated in the pathogenesis of certain cancers. Given the importance of cis-prenyltransferases in cellular pathways, further research into the regulation and function of this enzyme complex is critical for understanding its potential as a therapeutic target for various diseases. Moreover, elucidating the structural and biochemical properties of cis-prenyltransferases could provide valuable insights for the development of novel drugs aimed at modulating its activity.
