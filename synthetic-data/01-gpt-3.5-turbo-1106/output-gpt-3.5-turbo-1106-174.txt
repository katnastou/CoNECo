prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: cellulose synthases. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: Cellulose synthases are crucial enzymes for the formation of cellulose, a fundamental component of plant cell walls. In this study, we investigated the regulatory mechanisms of cellulose synthases in Arabidopsis thaliana using a combination of genetic and biochemical approaches. Our findings demonstrate that the expression of cellulose synthases is modulated by various signaling molecules, including auxins and brassinosteroids. Furthermore, we identified a novel transcription factor that directly regulates the expression of cellulose synthases, providing new insights into the molecular mechanisms controlling cellulose biosynthesis. These discoveries contribute to our understanding of plant cell wall formation and have implications for improving biomass production and biofuel development.
