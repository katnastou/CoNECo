prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: GBAF. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we investigated the role of the GBAF protein complex in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease. Utilizing a mouse model of the disease, we observed significant dysregulation of GBAF in the substantia nigra, a region implicated in the neurodegenerative process. We also found an association between aberrant GBAF activity and the accumulation of alpha-synuclein aggregates, a hallmark of Parkinson's disease pathology. Furthermore, our analysis revealed altered interaction patterns between GBAF and lysosomal enzymes, suggesting a potential link to impaired protein degradation. These findings highlight the potential involvement of GBAF in the molecular mechanisms associated with Parkinson's disease, offering a promising avenue for further exploration in the quest for therapeutic interventions.
