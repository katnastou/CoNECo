prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: alphav-beta1 integrin. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we investigated the role of the alphav-beta1 integrin protein complex in the progression of fibrotic liver disease. We utilized a mouse model of liver fibrosis to assess the expression and activity of alphav-beta1 integrin in hepatic stellate cells (HSCs). Our findings revealed a significant upregulation of alphav-beta1 integrin in activated HSCs during liver fibrosis, suggesting its potential involvement in the pathogenesis of the disease. Furthermore, pharmacological inhibition of alphav-beta1 integrin using a specific small molecule antagonist displayed a reduction in collagen deposition and liver fibrosis progression in vivo. These results indicate that targeting alphav-beta1 integrin may offer a promising therapeutic strategy for treating liver fibrosis.
