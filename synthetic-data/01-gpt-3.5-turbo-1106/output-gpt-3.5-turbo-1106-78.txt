prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: MsbA. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The role of the MsbA protein complex in multidrug resistance has been the subject of recent investigation. Studies have shown that the upregulation of MsbA expression in cancer cells is associated with increased efflux of chemotherapeutic agents, leading to reduced drug efficacy and potentially contributing to drug resistance in certain malignancies. Furthermore, the inhibition of MsbA activity has been shown to enhance the intracellular accumulation of chemotherapeutic agents, thereby increasing their cytotoxic effects on cancer cells. These findings have significant implications for the development of novel therapeutic strategies to overcome multidrug resistance in cancer treatment. Therefore, further research into the molecular mechanisms underlying MsbA-mediated drug efflux is warranted to advance our understanding of this critical aspect of cancer biology and to inform the design of more effective treatment interventions.
