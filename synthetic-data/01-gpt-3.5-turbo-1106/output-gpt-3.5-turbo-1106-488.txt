prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: NAC. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The NAC protein complex has been the focus of extensive research due to its crucial role in regulating cellular processes. Previous studies have established the involvement of NAC in protein degradation pathways and stress response mechanisms. However, the precise molecular interactions and regulatory mechanisms of the NAC complex remain elusive. Recent investigations have demonstrated that NAC is implicated in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's. Additionally, studies in model organisms have indicated a potential link between NAC dysfunction and age-related metabolic disorders. Further elucidating the functions and regulatory networks of the NAC complex is imperative for understanding its implications in human health and disease.
