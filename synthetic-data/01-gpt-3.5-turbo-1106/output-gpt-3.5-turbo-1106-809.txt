prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: HIUH. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we investigated the role of the HIUH protein complex in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease. Our findings demonstrate a significant upregulation of HIUH in the brain tissues of individuals with late-stage Alzheimer's disease, suggesting a potential association between HIUH and disease progression. Furthermore, we observed a co-localization of HIUH with amyloid-beta plaques, indicating a putative interaction between HIUH and the pathological hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease. Additionally, our analysis revealed a correlation between HIUH levels and cognitive decline in a cohort of Alzheimer's disease patients, suggesting a potential biomarker role for HIUH in disease prognosis. These results shed light on the potential involvement of the HIUH complex in the molecular pathways underlying Alzheimer's disease, warranting further investigation into its therapeutic implications.
