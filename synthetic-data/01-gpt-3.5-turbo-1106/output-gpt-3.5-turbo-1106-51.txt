prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: prefoldin. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The prefoldin protein complex has garnered significant attention in recent studies due to its pivotal role in protein folding and stability. Recent research has elucidated the molecular mechanisms by which prefoldin interacts with chaperone proteins to assist in the proper folding of nascent polypeptides. Additionally, studies have highlighted the implications of prefoldin dysfunction in various human diseases, including neurodegenerative disorders and cancer. Furthermore, investigations into the potential therapeutic targeting of prefoldin in the context of protein misfolding diseases have shown promising outcomes in preclinical models. These findings underscore the importance of further exploring the intricate functions of prefoldin in cellular homeostasis and disease pathology.
