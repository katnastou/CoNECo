prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: nickel-iron hydrogenases. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we investigated the role of nickel-iron hydrogenases in the metabolism of Clostridium pasteurianum. We evaluated the impact of various environmental conditions on the expression and activity of nickel-iron hydrogenases in this bacterium. Through biochemical assays and gene expression analysis, we demonstrated that nickel-iron hydrogenases are crucial for the anaerobic growth and hydrogen metabolism of C. pasteurianum. Furthermore, we identified potential regulatory factors that modulate the expression of nickel-iron hydrogenases in response to environmental cues. Our findings provide valuable insights into the function and regulation of nickel-iron hydrogenases and contribute to our understanding of the metabolic versatility of anaerobic microorganisms. This knowledge may inform the development of strategies for optimizing biohydrogen production using C. pasteurianum.
