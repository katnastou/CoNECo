prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: Fibrin. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: Our study aimed to investigate the role of the Fibrin protein complex in the pathogenesis of arterial thrombosis in patients with advanced atherosclerosis. We examined serum levels of Fibrin in a cohort of 100 patients with confirmed arterial thrombosis and 100 healthy controls. Our results revealed a significant elevation of Fibrin levels in the patients compared to controls, suggesting a potential association between Fibrin and the development of arterial thrombosis. Further analysis demonstrated a positive correlation between Fibrin levels and the severity of atherosclerosis, indicating that Fibrin may serve as a biomarker for disease progression. Our findings provide valuable insights into the involvement of Fibrin in the pathophysiology of arterial thrombosis and may have implications for the development of targeted therapies for this condition.
