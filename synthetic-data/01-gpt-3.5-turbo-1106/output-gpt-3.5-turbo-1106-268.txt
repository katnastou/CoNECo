prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: mglABC. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The mglABC protein complex has been implicated in the transport of methylglyoxal, a highly reactive carbonyl compound, across the cell membrane in various bacterial species. The binding and translocation of methylglyoxal by the mglABC complex is essential for the detoxification of this toxic compound, which is generated as a byproduct of glycolysis and can cause damage to cellular macromolecules. The mglABC complex is found in a wide range of pathogenic and non-pathogenic bacteria, highlighting its importance for cellular homeostasis and survival. Understanding the mechanisms of action and regulation of the mglABC complex may lead to the development of novel antimicrobial strategies targeting bacterial metabolism and virulence.
