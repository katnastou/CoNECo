prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: 5'-AMP-activated protein kinase. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The 5'-AMP-activated protein kinase is a crucial regulator of cellular energy homeostasis and metabolism in various organisms, including humans. Dysregulation of 5'-AMP-activated protein kinase activity has been implicated in a wide range of metabolic disorders, including obesity, type 2 diabetes, and cardiovascular diseases. Recent studies have elucidated the role of this protein complex in modulating glucose and lipid metabolism, as well as its involvement in the pathogenesis of insulin resistance and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. Furthermore, the pharmacological activation of 5'-AMP-activated protein kinase has emerged as a potential therapeutic strategy for metabolic disorders, highlighting its significance as a key molecular target for drug development. Continued research into the regulatory mechanisms and downstream effects of this protein complex holds promise for the development of novel therapeutic interventions to combat metabolic diseases.
