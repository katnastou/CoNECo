prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: carboxy-terminal domain protein kinase. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The carboxy-terminal domain protein kinase (CTDK) is a critical regulator of transcriptional activity in eukaryotic cells. Previous studies have highlighted the importance of CTDK in the phosphorylation of the RNA polymerase II carboxy-terminal domain, which is essential for proper transcriptional initiation and elongation. Dysregulation of CTDK activity has been associated with several human diseases, including cancer and neurodegenerative disorders. Furthermore, CTDK has been shown to interact with various signaling pathways and contribute to cellular differentiation and development. Understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying CTDK function may provide valuable insights for the development of targeted therapies for diseases associated with transcriptional dysregulation.
