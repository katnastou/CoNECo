prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: activated spliceosomes. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: Activated spliceosomes are essential components of the pre-mRNA splicing machinery and play a crucial role in the precise removal of introns from pre-mRNA transcripts. Recent studies have implicated the dysregulation of activated spliceosomes in various human diseases, including spinal muscular atrophy and certain forms of cancer. The complex interplay between small nuclear ribonucleoproteins, snRNAs, and specific splicing factors mediates the activation and function of spliceosomes, making them an attractive target for therapeutic intervention. Future research will undoubtedly focus on unraveling the intricate molecular mechanisms governing the assembly and regulation of activated spliceosomes, with the aim of developing novel strategies for the treatment of spliceosome-related disorders.
