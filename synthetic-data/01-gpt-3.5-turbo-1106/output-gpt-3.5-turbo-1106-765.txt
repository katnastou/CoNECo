prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: U2AF. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The U2AF protein complex plays a crucial role in pre-mRNA splicing, a fundamental process in eukaryotic gene expression. Recent studies have uncovered the interaction between U2AF and the splicing factor SF3B1 in the context of splicing dysregulation in cancer. It has been shown that mutations in SF3B1 can lead to aberrant pre-mRNA splicing patterns, resulting in the production of variant proteins associated with oncogenesis. Moreover, perturbation of the U2AF-SF3B1 interaction has been linked to impaired spliceosome assembly and inefficient splicing of specific exons in cancer cells. Understanding the functional relationship between U2AF and SF3B1 may provide valuable insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying splicing dysregulation in cancer, potentially leading to the development of novel therapeutic strategies targeting this process.
