prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: Translocon-associated protein. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: A crucial player in the cellular pathway of protein translocation is the Translocon-associated protein (TRAP). TRAP, a highly conserved integral membrane protein, is an essential component of the translocon machinery, aiding in the cotranslational translocation of nascent polypeptides across the endoplasmic reticulum membrane. Dysregulation of TRAP expression has been implicated in several pathological conditions, including inherited protein translocation disorders such as congenital disorders of glycosylation. Furthermore, recent studies have identified small molecule modulators that target TRAP, offering potential therapeutic avenues for the treatment of protein translocation-related diseases. The role of TRAP in these cellular processes underscores its significance in maintaining proper protein homeostasis and cellular function.
