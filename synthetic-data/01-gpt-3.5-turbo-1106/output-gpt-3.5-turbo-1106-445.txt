prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: secondary cell wall cellulose synthase. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The secondary cell wall cellulose synthase is a critical enzyme complex involved in the synthesis of cellulose, a major component of plant cell walls. Recent studies have highlighted the regulatory role of this complex in response to various environmental stresses, such as drought and pathogen attacks. Understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying the activity of secondary cell wall cellulose synthase is essential for developing strategies to enhance plant resilience and improve crop yield under challenging conditions. Furthermore, the identification of small molecules that modulate the activity of this complex could provide valuable tools for engineering plant cell walls with improved properties, with potential applications in biofuel production and biomaterial development.
