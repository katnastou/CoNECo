prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: mitochondrial ribonuclease P. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In recent years, the importance of mitochondrial ribonuclease P (mtRNase P) in the regulation of mitochondrial RNA processing has become increasingly evident. This evolutionarily conserved protein complex has been found to play a critical role in the endonucleolytic processing of precursor tRNAs within the mitochondria. Dysregulation or malfunction of mtRNase P has been implicated in various disorders, including mitochondrial diseases and neurodegenerative conditions. Further investigation into the molecular mechanisms and regulatory pathways governing the activity of mtRNase P holds promise for shedding light on the pathogenesis of these disorders, as well as for identifying potential targets for therapeutic intervention.
