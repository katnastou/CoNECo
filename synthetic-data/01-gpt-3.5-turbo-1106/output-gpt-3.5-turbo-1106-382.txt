prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: Tim22. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In recent studies, the Tim22 protein complex has been implicated in the regulation of mitochondrial protein import and assembly. Tim22 plays a crucial role in mediating the translocation of hydrophobic proteins across the mitochondrial inner membrane, contributing to the correct organization of the respiratory chain complexes. Dysfunction of the Tim22 complex has been associated with various human diseases, including neurodegenerative disorders and metabolic syndromes. Furthermore, the involvement of Tim22 in mitochondrial protein import pathways highlights its potential as a therapeutic target for addressing mitochondrial dysfunction in various pathological conditions. Understanding the molecular mechanisms of Tim22 function may offer new insights into the development of treatments for diseases associated with mitochondrial dysfunction.
