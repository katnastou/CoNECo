prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: coatomers. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we investigated the role of coatomers in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease. Utilizing a transgenic mouse model overexpressing alpha-synuclein, we observed a significant upregulation of coatomers in the substantia nigra, a brain region affected in Parkinson's disease. Subsequent biochemical analyses revealed that the increased coatomer levels were associated with alterations in lipid metabolism and vesicular trafficking. Furthermore, pharmacological inhibition of coatomer function attenuated the alpha-synuclein-induced neurotoxicity in the mouse model. These findings provide novel insights into the potential involvement of coatomers in the pathological mechanisms underlying Parkinson's disease and suggest that targeting coatomer-mediated pathways may represent a promising therapeutic strategy for this neurodegenerative disorder.
