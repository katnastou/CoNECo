prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: WHY1. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The protein complex, WHY1, plays a critical role in cellular homeostasis and oxidative stress response. Previous research has shown that dysregulation of WHY1 is associated with increased susceptibility to age-related neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease. In this study, we aimed to investigate the potential therapeutic effects of a novel compound, sulforaphane, in regulating the expression and activity of WHY1 in a transgenic mouse model of Alzheimer's disease. Our results indicate that sulforaphane treatment effectively upregulated the expression of WHY1 and mitigated oxidative damage in the brains of the transgenic mice. These findings highlight the potential of targeting WHY1 as a promising strategy for combating neurodegenerative diseases.
