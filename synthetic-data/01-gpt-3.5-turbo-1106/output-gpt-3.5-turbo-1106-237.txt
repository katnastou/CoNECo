prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: fibrinogen gamma chain. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we investigated the effect of fibrinogen gamma chain on the progression of atherosclerosis in a murine model of the disease. By utilizing a transgenic mouse model overexpressing fibrinogen gamma chain, we observed a significant acceleration of atherosclerotic plaque formation compared to wild-type controls. Furthermore, histological analysis revealed increased macrophage infiltration and pro-inflammatory cytokine expression in the aortic lesions of the transgenic mice. Our findings suggest a potential role for fibrinogen gamma chain in promoting the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis, highlighting the importance of further exploring the mechanisms underlying its contribution to vascular disease. This study provides valuable insights into the molecular pathways involved in atherosclerotic progression and may lead to the development of targeted therapies aimed at modulating fibrinogen gamma chain activity for the treatment of cardiovascular diseases.
