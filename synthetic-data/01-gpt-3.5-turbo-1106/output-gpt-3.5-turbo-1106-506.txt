prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: DNA polymerase III, core. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, the role of DNA polymerase III, core in the replication process of the bacterial organism Escherichia coli was investigated. It was found that the inhibition of this protein complex led to a significant reduction in the rate of DNA synthesis, causing a buildup of single-strand breaks and an increase in the frequency of mutagenesis. Moreover, the absence of DNA polymerase III, core was associated with a decreased cell viability and an elevated susceptibility to various environmental stressors. These findings highlight the essential function of this protein complex in maintaining genome integrity and cellular fitness in E. coli, and underscore its potential as a target for antimicrobial strategies aimed at combating bacterial infections.
