prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: mitochondrial DNA-directed RNA polymerase. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The mitochondrial DNA-directed RNA polymerase (mtRNAP) is a crucial enzyme responsible for the transcription of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) in eukaryotic cells. Dysfunction of mtRNAP has been linked to a variety of mitochondrial disorders, including Leigh syndrome and MELAS (mitochondrial encephalomyopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episodes). Recent studies have investigated the potential role of mtRNAP in the regulation of mitochondrial gene expression and its impact on cellular metabolism. Additionally, the discovery of small molecule modulators targeting mtRNAP activity holds promise for the development of novel therapeutics for mitochondrial diseases. Further research is warranted to elucidate the intricate mechanisms underlying mtRNAP function and its implications for human health.
