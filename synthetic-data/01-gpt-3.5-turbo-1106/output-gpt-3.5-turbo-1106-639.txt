prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: IgD immunoglobulins. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we investigated the role of IgD immunoglobulins in the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases. Through a series of in vivo experiments using a murine model of systemic lupus erythematosus, we observed a significant upregulation of IgD immunoglobulins in the affected tissues. Furthermore, we found a correlation between the levels of IgD immunoglobulins and the severity of kidney damage in these animals. Our findings suggest that IgD immunoglobulins may play a critical role in the initiation and progression of autoimmune disorders, particularly those involving the renal system. These results provide new insights into the potential therapeutic targets for the management of autoimmune diseases associated with IgD immunoglobulins dysregulation.
