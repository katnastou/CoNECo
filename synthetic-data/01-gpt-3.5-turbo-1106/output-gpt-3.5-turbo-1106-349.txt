prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: discoidal high-density lipoprotein particles. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we investigated the role of discoidal high-density lipoprotein particles in the modulation of atherosclerosis in ApoE-deficient mice. We administered a high-fat diet to the mice to induce the formation of atherosclerotic plaques and then treated them with a synthetic molecule known to promote the formation of discoidal high-density lipoprotein particles. We observed a significant reduction in atherosclerotic plaque burden in the treated mice compared to the control group. Furthermore, we found that the treated mice exhibited decreased levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines and a shift towards an anti-inflammatory immune profile. Our findings suggest that promoting the formation of discoidal high-density lipoprotein particles may represent a promising therapeutic approach for mitigating atherosclerosis.
