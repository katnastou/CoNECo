prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: SRP. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The signal recognition particle (SRP) is a pivotal component in the process of co-translational protein targeting to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) in eukaryotic cells. In the context of various cellular stressors, such as ER stress, SRP has been implicated in playing a crucial role in the maintenance of ER homeostasis. Previous studies have demonstrated the association between dysfunction of SRP and the pathogenesis of certain neurodegenerative disorders, including Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease. Furthermore, aberrant regulation of SRP has also been linked to the development of certain types of cancer. Understanding the intricate involvement of SRP in these ailments provides insight into potential therapeutic targets and strategies for the treatment of such conditions.
