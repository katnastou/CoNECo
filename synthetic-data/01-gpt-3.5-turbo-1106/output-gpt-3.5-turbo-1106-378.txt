prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: Citrate lyase. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: A key regulatory target in the study of metabolic disorders is the citrate lyase protein complex, which plays a crucial role in the conversion of citrate into acetyl-CoA and oxaloacetate. Dysregulation of this process has been implicated in various metabolic diseases, including obesity, diabetes, and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. Recent studies have identified potential therapeutic agents that can modulate the activity of citrate lyase, offering promising avenues for the development of novel treatments for metabolic disorders. Furthermore, investigation into the downstream effects of citrate lyase activity on cellular processes has revealed potential links to cancer metabolism, highlighting the multifaceted implications of targeting this protein complex for therapeutic interventions. These findings underscore the importance of further research into the molecular mechanisms governing citrate lyase function and its potential as a therapeutic target for metabolic and oncogenic diseases.
