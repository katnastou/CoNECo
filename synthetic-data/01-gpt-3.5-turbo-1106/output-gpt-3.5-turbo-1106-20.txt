prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: membrane-bound IgA. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The membrane-bound IgA complex plays a crucial role in mucosal immunity, particularly in defense against respiratory and gastrointestinal pathogens. This large multi-subunit protein complex consists of several subunits that allow for binding to specific antigenic substances, ultimately facilitating their clearance from the body. Recent studies have implicated membrane-bound IgA in the pathogenesis of certain autoimmune disorders, suggesting its potential as a diagnostic biomarker and therapeutic target. Furthermore, alterations in the expression and activity of membrane-bound IgA have been observed in various infectious diseases, highlighting its importance in the context of host-pathogen interactions. Given the diverse roles of membrane-bound IgA in health and disease, further investigation into its structure, function, and regulation is warranted to provide deeper insights into the complexities of mucosal immunity.
