prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: CHEVI tethering. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: Recent studies have identified a novel protein complex named CHEVI tethering, which has been implicated in the regulation of cellular signaling pathways. The CHEVI tethering complex has been shown to interact with various cellular proteins involved in inflammation and immune response, suggesting a potential role in immune modulation. Additionally, genetic polymorphisms in the genes encoding components of the CHEVI tethering complex have been associated with autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis and systemic lupus erythematosus. These findings highlight the importance of further investigating the functional significance of the CHEVI tethering complex in the context of human health and disease. Understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying the activity of the CHEVI tethering complex may offer new insights into the pathogenesis of immune-related disorders and could potentially pave the way for the development of targeted therapeutic interventions.
