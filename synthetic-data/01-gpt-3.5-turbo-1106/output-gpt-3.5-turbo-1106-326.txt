prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: exon junctions. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: Exon junctions are essential regulatory structures involved in the post-transcriptional processing of mRNA molecules. The formation of exon junctions plays a critical role in mRNA surveillance pathways, ensuring the fidelity of gene expression. Dysregulation of exon junctions has been implicated in a range of human diseases, including neurodevelopmental disorders and cancer. Recent studies have elucidated the interplay between exon junctions and the splicing machinery, shedding light on the intricate mechanisms underlying mRNA maturation. Additionally, small molecule modulators targeting the stability and function of exon junctions have shown promise as therapeutic interventions for diseases associated with aberrant mRNA processing. Further investigations into the role of exon junctions in human health and disease are warranted to uncover potential avenues for therapeutic intervention.
