prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: checkpoint clamp. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The role of the checkpoint clamp protein complex in DNA damage response has been extensively studied in various organisms. Upon detection of DNA damage, the checkpoint clamp complex plays a critical role in orchestrating the activation of cell cycle checkpoints and the recruitment of DNA repair factors to the site of damage. Dysregulation of the checkpoint clamp complex has been linked to increased genomic instability and has been implicated in a variety of human diseases, including cancer and neurodegenerative disorders. Understanding the mechanisms underlying the function of the checkpoint clamp complex may provide valuable insights for the development of novel therapeutic strategies for diseases associated with DNA repair defects. Furthermore, investigation into the regulation and interplay of the checkpoint clamp complex with other DNA damage response pathways may unveil new avenues for targeted intervention in pathological conditions.
