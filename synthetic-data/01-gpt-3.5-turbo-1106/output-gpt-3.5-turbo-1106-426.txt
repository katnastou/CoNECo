prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: mitotic septins. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The mitotic septins are a conserved protein complex that plays a crucial role in cell division and cytokinesis. Dysregulation of mitotic septins has been implicated in various cancer types, including breast cancer and leukemia, highlighting the potential significance of this complex in disease progression. Recent studies have shown that the phosphorylation status of mitotic septins can influence their subcellular localization and function. Furthermore, small molecule inhibitors targeting mitotic septins have emerged as promising candidates for anti-cancer therapies. Understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying the regulation and function of mitotic septins is therefore of utmost importance for the development of novel therapeutic strategies in cancer treatment.
