prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: alpha-glucosidase II. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The alpha-glucosidase II complex has been the subject of considerable interest due to its pivotal role in glycoprotein quality control within the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). This complex, composed of catalytic and regulatory subunits, plays a crucial role in the trimming and processing of N-linked glycans on nascent glycoproteins, ensuring proper folding and function of these proteins. Dysregulation of the alpha-glucosidase II complex has been implicated in various diseases, such as congenital disorders of glycosylation, where aberrant glycosylation patterns lead to systemic dysfunction. Furthermore, recent studies have suggested potential therapeutic targets within the alpha-glucosidase II complex for the treatment of protein folding diseases, highlighting its relevance in biomedical research.
