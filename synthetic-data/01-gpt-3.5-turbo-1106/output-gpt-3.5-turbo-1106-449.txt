prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: inflammasomes. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The activation and regulation of inflammasomes play critical roles in the innate immune response to infection and inflammation. Upon sensing pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) or danger-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), inflammasomes are assembled, leading to the proteolytic maturation of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin-1β (IL-1β) and interleukin-18 (IL-18). Dysregulation of inflammasome activation has been implicated in various inflammatory disorders, including rheumatoid arthritis, atherosclerosis, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Moreover, the identification of small molecule inhibitors targeting inflammasomes has shown promise in preclinical models of inflammatory diseases, indicating the potential of inflammasome modulation as a therapeutic strategy. Therefore, further investigation into the molecular mechanisms governing inflammasome activation and potential therapeutic interventions targeting inflammasomes may offer new insights into the treatment of inflammatory diseases.
