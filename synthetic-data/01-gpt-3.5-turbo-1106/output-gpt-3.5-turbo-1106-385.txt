prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: NMS. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we investigated the potential role of the NMS protein complex in the etiology of Alzheimer's disease. Through a series of biochemical assays and cellular experiments, we demonstrated that levels of NMS were significantly elevated in brain tissues of Alzheimer's disease patients compared to age-matched controls. Additionally, we observed a positive correlation between NMS expression and the severity of cognitive impairments in these patients. Furthermore, pharmacological inhibition of NMS activity resulted in a significant reduction in amyloid beta accumulation and neuroinflammation in a transgenic mouse model of Alzheimer's disease. Our findings suggest that targeting the NMS protein complex may represent a promising therapeutic strategy for alleviating the pathological progression of Alzheimer's disease.
