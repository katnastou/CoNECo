prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: axonemal dynein light chain. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The axonemal dynein light chain has been implicated in several genetic disorders, including primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) and Kartagener syndrome. Dysfunction of this protein complex has been correlated with impaired ciliary movement and mucus clearance, leading to chronic respiratory infections and sinusitis in affected individuals. Studies have shown that mutations in the axonemal dynein light chain can lead to structural abnormalities in cilia, resulting in compromised motility and functionality. Furthermore, research has highlighted the role of the axonemal dynein light chain in mediating cellular processes related to cilium formation and maintenance. These findings underscore the significance of understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying the function of axonemal dynein light chain in the context of ciliary biology and human health.
