prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: CPSase As. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: Recent studies have investigated the role of the CPSase As protein complex in the pathogenesis of carbamoyl phosphate synthetase I deficiency. This deficiency is a rare genetic disorder characterized by impaired ammonia detoxification and often leads to hyperammonemia and neurological complications. The current study aimed to identify potential pharmacological agents that can modulate the activity of CPSase As and thereby ameliorate the biochemical and clinical manifestations of carbamoyl phosphate synthetase I deficiency. Using a combination of in vitro and in vivo models, the research found that the chemical compound XZ-123 demonstrated a significant inhibitory effect on CPSase As activity, leading to a reduction in ammonia levels and improved neurological outcomes in mice with carbamoyl phosphate synthetase I deficiency. These findings suggest that targeting CPSase As may hold promise as a therapeutic strategy for managing this devastating disorder.
