prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: Abeta-derived diffusible ligands. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In recent years, there has been increasing interest in the potential role of Abeta-derived diffusible ligands (ADDLs) in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease. Accumulating evidence suggests that ADDLs may play a significant role in synaptic dysfunction and neurotoxicity associated with the disease. Studies have indicated that ADDLs can elicit detrimental effects on neuronal function, leading to impairments in memory and cognition. Furthermore, investigations into the interactions between ADDLs and specific receptors on neuronal membranes have revealed potential therapeutic targets for mitigating the neurotoxic effects of ADDLs. Understanding the mechanisms underlying the involvement of ADDLs in Alzheimer's disease pathology may provide valuable insights for the development of targeted interventions aimed at ameliorating disease progression and improving patient outcomes.
