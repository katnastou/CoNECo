prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: RITS. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The RNA-induced transcriptional silencing (RITS) complex is a crucial mediator of gene silencing in fission yeast. Recent studies have illuminated the role of RITS in the regulation of heterochromatin formation and maintenance. The complex, consisting of Chp1, Tas3, and Ago1, associates with small interfering RNAs and targets nascent transcripts from transposons and repetitive elements, thereby facilitating transcriptional silencing and maintenance of genome integrity. Dysregulation of RITS activity has been linked to various pathological conditions, including cancer and neurodegenerative diseases. Understanding the intricate mechanisms underlying RITS function may pave the way for the development of novel therapeutic interventions targeting aberrant gene expression in disease states.
