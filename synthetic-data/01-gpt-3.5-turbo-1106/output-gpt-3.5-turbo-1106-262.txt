prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: Brahma-associated factor. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The Brahma-associated factor (BAF) complex plays a crucial role in the regulation of chromatin structure and gene expression. Previous studies have demonstrated that alterations in BAF complex activity are associated with a wide range of developmental disorders, including Coffin-Siris syndrome and Nicolaides-Baraitser syndrome. The complex is composed of multiple subunits, each contributing to its functional integrity. Recent research has revealed a potential link between the BAF complex and the pathogenesis of certain cancers, suggesting that targeting its activity may hold promise for the development of novel therapeutic strategies. Furthermore, the identification of small molecule modulators of the BAF complex could offer new avenues for intervention in diseases characterized by dysregulated gene expression. Understanding the precise mechanisms underlying the function of the BAF complex is therefore of paramount importance in both basic research and clinical applications.
