prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: ACCases. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we investigated the role of the ACCases protein complex in regulating fatty acid synthesis in human hepatocytes. Our results demonstrate that inhibition of ACCases activity with the specific small molecule inhibitor led to a significant reduction in intracellular levels of malonyl-CoA, a key intermediate in fatty acid biosynthesis. Furthermore, we observed a concomitant decrease in de novo lipogenesis and triglyceride accumulation in the hepatocytes treated with the ACCases inhibitor. Interestingly, the expression of key enzymes involved in fatty acid oxidation, such as CPT1A, was upregulated in response to the reduced malonyl-CoA levels. These findings suggest that targeting the ACCases protein complex may offer a potential therapeutic approach for treating non-alcoholic fatty liver disease.
