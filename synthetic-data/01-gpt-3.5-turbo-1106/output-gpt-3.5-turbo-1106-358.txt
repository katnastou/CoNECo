prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: SUMO-targeted ubiquitin ligase. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: This study investigates the role of the SUMO-targeted ubiquitin ligase (STUbL) in the context of cellular response to oxidative stress. With increasing evidence of the involvement of STUbL in various cellular processes, including DNA repair and genome stability, it is essential to elucidate its potential linkage to oxidative stress-induced cellular damage. Using a well-established yeast model, our research team observed a significant decrease in STUbL activity following exposure to hydrogen peroxide, a common oxidizing agent. Furthermore, we identified a potential interaction between STUbL and a key transcription factor associated with oxidative stress response. These findings provide valuable insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying the cellular response to oxidative stress and shed light on potential therapeutic targets for oxidative stress-related diseases.
