prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: ThiFS. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The ThiFS protein complex plays a key role in the biosynthesis of thiamine, an essential cofactor in central metabolism. The complex, comprised of ThiF and ThiS subunits, coordinates the transfer of sulfur from ThiS to ThiF for the subsequent synthesis of thiamine. Dysfunction of the ThiFS complex has been implicated in thiamine deficiency disorders, such as beriberi, which manifest with neurological and cardiovascular symptoms. Recent studies have unveiled the intricate regulation of ThiFS activity by various cellular processes, shedding light on potential therapeutic targets for thiamine deficiency-related conditions. Understanding the biochemical and functional properties of the ThiFS complex is crucial for advancing the development of novel interventions to mitigate thiamine deficiency and its associated pathologies.
