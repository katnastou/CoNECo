prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: BtuCD. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we investigated the role of the BtuCD protein complex in the cellular transport of cobalamin (vitamin B12) in a mouse model of pernicious anemia. Our results demonstrate that the absence of functional BtuCD leads to impaired cobalamin uptake in the intestinal epithelial cells, resulting in decreased levels of circulating cobalamin and consequential development of megaloblastic anemia. Furthermore, we observed a significant decrease in the expression of transcobalamin II, a cobalamin binding protein, in the liver and kidney tissues of mice lacking functional BtuCD. These findings provide valuable insights into the importance of the BtuCD protein complex in cobalamin transport and its potential implications for the understanding and management of pernicious anemia in humans.
