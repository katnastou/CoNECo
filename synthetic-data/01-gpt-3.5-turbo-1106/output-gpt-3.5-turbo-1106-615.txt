prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: CHRAC. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The chromatin accessibility complex (CHRAC) is a crucial player in regulating chromatin structure and gene expression. Previous studies have demonstrated that CHRAC interacts with histones and other chromatin-modifying enzymes to modulate nucleosome positioning and structure. This intricate interplay contributes to the dynamic nature of chromatin, impacting various cellular processes such as transcription, DNA replication, and DNA repair. Dysregulation of CHRAC has been associated with developmental disorders and cancer, highlighting its role in maintaining cellular homeostasis. Further investigations into the molecular mechanisms underlying CHRAC function will provide valuable insights into chromatin biology and potential therapeutic targets for diseases related to chromatin dysregulation.
