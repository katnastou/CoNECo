prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: multisynthetase. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we investigated the role of the multisynthetase complex in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis in a mouse model. We observed a significant upregulation of the multisynthetase complex in the aorta of mice fed a high-fat diet compared to control mice. Furthermore, inhibition of the multisynthetase complex using a specific small molecule inhibitor resulted in a reduction in atherosclerotic lesion size and decreased macrophage infiltration in the vessel wall. Our findings suggest that the multisynthetase complex may play a critical role in the development of atherosclerosis and could be a potential therapeutic target for this common cardiovascular disease.
