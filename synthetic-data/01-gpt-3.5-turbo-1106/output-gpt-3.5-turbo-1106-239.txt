prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: centralspindlin. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: Centralspindlin plays a critical role in the regulation of cytokinesis, the process of cell division. Recent studies have demonstrated the importance of centralspindlin in mediating the localization and activation of the RhoA GTPase, a key regulator of the actomyosin contractile ring. Dysregulation of centralspindlin has been implicated in various diseases, including cancer and developmental disorders. Understanding the precise mechanisms of centralspindlin-mediated signaling pathways may offer valuable insights for the development of potential therapeutic interventions targeting cytokinesis-related diseases. Hence, further investigation into the role of centralspindlin in cellular processes has significant potential for advancing biomedical knowledge and clinical applications.
