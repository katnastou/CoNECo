prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: Set3. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: A growing body of evidence has implicated the protein complex Set3 in the regulation of gene expression. Recent studies have demonstrated that Set3 interacts with histone deacetylases and plays a critical role in modulating chromatin structure and gene transcription. Furthermore, experimental data suggests that dysregulation of Set3 activity may be associated with certain pathological conditions, such as cancer and neurodegenerative diseases. The elucidation of Set3's molecular mechanisms and its functional significance in the context of normal and disease states represents an important area of future research in the field of epigenetics and gene regulation.
