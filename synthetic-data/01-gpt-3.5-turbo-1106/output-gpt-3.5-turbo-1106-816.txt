prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: LSU. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we investigate the role of LSU protein complex in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease. We aimed to elucidate the interaction between LSU and Aβ peptide in the development of amyloid plaques, a hallmark pathology in Alzheimer's disease. Using transgenic mouse models, we observed a significant increase in LSU expression in brain tissue affected by amyloid plaques compared to healthy controls. Furthermore, our in vitro experiments demonstrated a direct binding interaction between LSU and Aβ peptide, suggesting a potential mechanism for LSU involvement in Alzheimer's disease. These findings suggest that LSU may serve as a potential therapeutic target for modulating Aβ aggregation and reducing amyloid plaque formation in Alzheimer's disease.
