prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: glutamic dehydrogenase. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: Glutamic dehydrogenase is a key enzyme in the metabolism of glutamate, an important excitatory neurotransmitter in the brain. Dysregulation of glutamate metabolism has been implicated in various neurological disorders, including epilepsy and neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's. Studies have shown that alterations in the activity of glutamic dehydrogenase can lead to imbalances in glutamate homeostasis, contributing to the pathophysiology of these conditions. Therefore, understanding the regulation and function of glutamic dehydrogenase is crucial for developing novel therapeutic strategies to target glutamate-related disorders. Further investigation into the molecular mechanisms governing the activity of glutamic dehydrogenase may provide valuable insights into the pathogenesis of these neurological conditions and offer potential avenues for therapeutic intervention.
