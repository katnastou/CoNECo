prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: surface IgGs. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we investigated the role of the surface IgGs protein complex in the immune response to Streptococcus pneumoniae infections. Our findings demonstrate that the expression levels of surface IgGs are upregulated in B cells following exposure to the pathogen, leading to enhanced opsonization and phagocytosis of the bacteria by macrophages. Furthermore, we observed a significant decrease in the severity of pneumococcal pneumonia in mice lacking surface IgGs, indicating its crucial role in host defense against this infectious disease. Our data suggest that targeting surface IgGs could be a promising therapeutic strategy for enhancing the immune response to S. pneumoniae and other related infections.
