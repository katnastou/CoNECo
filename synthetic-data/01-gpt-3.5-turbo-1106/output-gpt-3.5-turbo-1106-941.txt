prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: Putrescine ABC transporter. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we investigated the role of the Putrescine ABC transporter in the cellular uptake of putrescine, a polyamine implicated in various physiological and pathological processes. Using a combination of biochemical assays and genetic manipulations, we demonstrated that the Putrescine ABC transporter is essential for the efficient transport of putrescine across cell membranes. Furthermore, we found that dysregulation of the Putrescine ABC transporter was associated with altered levels of putrescine in the cellular environment, leading to aberrant cell growth and proliferation. Our findings shed light on the significance of the Putrescine ABC transporter in maintaining intracellular putrescine homeostasis, and highlight its potential as a therapeutic target for diseases related to dysregulated polyamine metabolism.
