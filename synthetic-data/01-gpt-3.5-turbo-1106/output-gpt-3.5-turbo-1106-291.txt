prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: apoB mRNA editing enzyme. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we aimed to investigate the regulatory role of the apoB mRNA editing enzyme in the development of atherosclerosis. We utilized a mouse model of hypercholesterolemia to explore the impact of apoB mRNA editing enzyme on lipid metabolism and plaque formation. Our results revealed that genetic manipulation of the apoB mRNA editing enzyme led to substantial changes in plasma lipid levels and atherosclerotic lesion formation. Furthermore, we observed a significant alteration in the expression pattern of key genes involved in cholesterol homeostasis. These findings provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis and suggest that the apoB mRNA editing enzyme may serve as a potential therapeutic target for the management of this prevalent cardiovascular disease.
