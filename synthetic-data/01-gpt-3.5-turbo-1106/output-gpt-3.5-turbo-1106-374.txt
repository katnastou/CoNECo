prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: cytoplasmic dyneins. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The cytoplasmic dyneins are microtubule motor proteins that play a crucial role in intracellular transport processes in eukaryotic cells. Recent studies have implicated cytoplasmic dyneins in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Dysregulation of cytoplasmic dynein activity has been observed in various cellular processes, including vesicular trafficking, mitosis, and ciliary function. Furthermore, small molecule inhibitors targeting cytoplasmic dyneins have shown promise in preclinical models as potential therapeutic agents for certain malignancies, highlighting the potential clinical relevance of targeting this protein complex. Further investigation into the mechanisms underlying cytoplasmic dynein function and regulation may offer new insights into the treatment of diseases associated with impaired intracellular transport.
