prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: Kininogenin. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In recent years, there has been growing interest in the potential role of the Kininogenin protein complex in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular diseases. Studies have revealed a putative association between dysregulation of Kininogenin and the development of hypertension and atherosclerosis in animal models. Furthermore, clinical investigations have reported altered levels of Kininogenin in patients with coronary artery disease and myocardial infarction, suggesting a potential diagnostic and prognostic utility of this protein complex. The elucidation of the precise molecular mechanisms underlying the involvement of Kininogenin in cardiovascular pathology may pave the way for the development of novel therapeutic strategies targeting this complex for the prevention and treatment of cardiovascular disorders.
