prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: RNAPII. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In recent years, the role of the RNAPII protein complex in the regulation of transcription has garnered increasing attention. Studies have highlighted the significance of RNAPII in governing the expression of genes associated with various disease states, such as cancer and neurodegenerative disorders. Furthermore, investigations into the impact of small molecules on the activity of RNAPII have illuminated potential therapeutic avenues for treating these conditions. Notably, the interaction between RNAPII and specific DNA sequences has been implicated in the pathogenesis of certain diseases, highlighting the potential for targeted interventions. These findings underscore the potential of targeting the RNAPII complex in the development of novel therapeutics for a range of human diseases.
