prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: MICOS. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The mitochondrial contact site and cristae organizing system (MICOS) complex is a crucial player in maintaining mitochondrial structure and function. Dysfunction of the MICOS complex has been associated with various pathological conditions, including neurodegenerative diseases and metabolic disorders. Recent studies have revealed the importance of lipid metabolism in regulating the assembly and stability of the MICOS complex. Furthermore, it has been shown that chemical modulators targeting lipid synthesis pathways can influence MICOS complex integrity and mitochondrial morphology. Understanding the intricate interplay between MICOS complex, lipid metabolism, and disease pathogenesis holds great promise for the development of novel therapeutic strategies to alleviate mitochondrial-related disorders.
