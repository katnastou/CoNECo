prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: ESCRT IV. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The endosomal sorting complex required for transport IV (ESCRT IV) plays a critical role in the regulation of cellular homeostasis and the degradation of ubiquitinated membrane proteins. Dysfunction of ESCRT IV has been linked to various human diseases, including neurodegenerative disorders and viral infections. Recent studies have highlighted the interaction of ESCRT IV with the HIV-1 Gag protein and its relevance in the budding of retroviruses. Furthermore, the importance of ESCRT IV in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease has been increasingly recognized, with evidence suggesting a potential link between ESCRT IV dysfunction and the abnormal accumulation of amyloid-Î² peptides. These findings underscore the significance of ESCRT IV in both normal cellular function and disease pathology, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target for a wide range of human disorders.
