prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: CoQ-synthome. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The CoQ-synthome is an essential multi-subunit enzyme complex responsible for the biosynthesis of coenzyme Q (CoQ), a vital lipid-soluble electron carrier in the mitochondrial respiratory chain. Dysfunction of the CoQ-synthome has been implicated in various human diseases, including primary CoQ deficiency syndrome, which is characterized by a wide spectrum of clinical manifestations, such as encephalomyopathy, ataxia, and nephropathy. Recent studies have shed light on the regulatory mechanisms governing the assembly and activity of the CoQ-synthome, highlighting potential therapeutic targets for the treatment of CoQ-related disorders. Additionally, the identification and characterization of small molecules modulating CoQ-synthome function may offer novel therapeutic strategies for managing mitochondrial dysfunction and associated pathologies.
