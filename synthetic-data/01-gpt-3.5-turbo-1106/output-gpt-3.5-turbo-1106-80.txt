prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: arginine-specific carbamoyl phosphate synthetase. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we sought to investigate the potential role of the arginine-specific carbamoyl phosphate synthetase (ACPS) in the pathogenesis of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). We employed a murine model of high-fat diet-induced NAFLD to observe changes in ACPS expression and activity. Our results demonstrated a significant upregulation of ACPS in the liver tissues of mice with NAFLD compared to controls. Furthermore, we performed biochemical assays to assess the correlation between ACPS activity and hepatic triglyceride levels. Notably, our findings revealed a positive correlation, suggesting that ACPS may contribute to the dysregulation of lipid metabolism in the context of NAFLD. These findings shed light on a potential mechanism underlying NAFLD development and warrant further investigation into the therapeutic targeting of ACPS in the management of this prevalent metabolic disorder.
