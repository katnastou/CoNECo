prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: NZR. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we investigated the role of the NZR protein complex in the pathogenesis of liver fibrosis. We utilized a murine model of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and observed a significant upregulation of NZR expression in the liver tissues of NASH mice compared to controls. Moreover, treatment with a specific NZR inhibitor led to a reduction in hepatic inflammation and fibrosis markers, indicating a potential therapeutic target for NASH-related liver fibrosis. Our findings provide valuable insights into the involvement of the NZR complex in liver pathology and underscore the potential of targeting this complex for the development of novel anti-fibrotic strategies.
