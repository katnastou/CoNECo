prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: C1q. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The role of the C1q protein complex in the pathogenesis of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) has been the subject of significant research interest. This study aimed to investigate the potential modulation of C1q activity by small molecule inhibitors in a murine model of SLE. Our findings suggest that the administration of a specific small molecule inhibitor led to a significant reduction in C1q expression and activity, concomitant with a decrease in inflammatory markers and glomerular damage. These results provide important insights into the potential therapeutic targeting of C1q in SLE and shed light on the intricate interplay between C1q and the pathophysiology of autoimmune diseases. Further investigation is warranted to elucidate the mechanistic underpinnings of C1q modulation and its potential for therapeutic intervention in SLE.
