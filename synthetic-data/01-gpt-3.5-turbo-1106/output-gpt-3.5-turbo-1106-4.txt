prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: alpha3-beta1 integrin. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we investigated the role of the alpha3-beta1 integrin complex in the progression of diabetic nephropathy. Using a murine model of type 2 diabetes, we observed substantial upregulation of the alpha3-beta1 integrin in the renal tubules of diabetic mice compared to non-diabetic controls. Furthermore, treatment with a specific inhibitor of the alpha3-beta1 integrin complex significantly attenuated albuminuria and reduced glomerular hypertrophy in diabetic mice. These findings not only highlight the importance of the alpha3-beta1 integrin complex in the pathogenesis of diabetic nephropathy but also suggest its potential as a therapeutic target for mitigating renal complications associated with diabetes. These results provide a promising foundation for further investigations into the molecular mechanisms underlying the involvement of the alpha3-beta1 integrin complex in diabetic nephropathy.
