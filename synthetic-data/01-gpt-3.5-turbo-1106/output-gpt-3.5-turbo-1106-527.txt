prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: CATSPER channels. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: CATSPER channels are known to play a vital role in the regulation of intracellular calcium levels in sperm cells. Recent studies have revealed that these channels are crucial for sperm motility and the process of fertilization. Dysfunction of CATSPER channels has been implicated in male infertility, with mutations in the corresponding genes leading to impaired sperm function. The activation of CATSPER channels by specific chemical modulators has emerged as a potential target for the development of novel contraceptives and fertility treatments. Understanding the intricate mechanisms underlying the function of CATSPER channels holds promise for advancing the field of reproductive biology and could lead to important clinical applications.
