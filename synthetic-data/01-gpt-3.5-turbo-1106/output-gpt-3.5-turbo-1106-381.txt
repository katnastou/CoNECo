prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: MSA. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we investigated the role of the MSA protein complex in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease. We utilized a transgenic mouse model overexpressing alpha-synuclein to examine the impact of MSA on the progression of neurodegeneration. Our results revealed that MSA levels were significantly elevated in the substantia nigra of the transgenic mice, concomitant with the development of motor impairment and dopaminergic neuron loss. Furthermore, pharmacological inhibition of MSA activity attenuated the neuroinflammatory response and ameliorated motor deficits in the transgenic mice. This study sheds light on the potential therapeutic targeting of the MSA protein complex in mitigating the neurodegenerative processes associated with Parkinson's disease.
