prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: HEX B. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we investigated the role of the HEX B protein complex in the pathogenesis of lysosomal storage disorders. Our findings reveal a potential interaction between HEX B and lysosomal enzymes, implicating the complex in the degradation of glycosaminoglycans within lysosomes. Utilizing a murine model of mucopolysaccharidosis, we observed a significant reduction in the activity of HEX B in affected tissues, suggesting a potential link to the progression of this debilitating disorder. Furthermore, our analysis of patient samples demonstrated altered levels of HEX B in individuals with lysosomal storage disorders, highlighting its potential as a biomarker for disease diagnosis and monitoring. These results shed light on the involvement of the HEX B complex in lysosomal dysfunction and pave the way for further investigations into targeted therapeutic interventions for these devastating conditions.
