prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: ethanolamine ammonia-lyase. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: Ethanolamine ammonia-lyase is a key enzyme involved in the catabolism of ethanolamine, a component of phospholipids, into acetaldehyde and ammonia. This enzyme plays a crucial role in the biodegradation of ethanolamine and is found in various organisms, including bacteria and plants. The activity of ethanolamine ammonia-lyase has been implicated in the pathogenesis of certain liver diseases, where abnormal levels of acetaldehyde and ammonia can lead to hepatic dysfunction. Furthermore, the regulation of this enzyme has been studied in the context of bacterial metabolism and its potential impact on microbial communities in the gut. Understanding the mechanisms of ethanolamine ammonia-lyase activity may provide insights into the development of therapeutic strategies for liver disorders and the modulation of gut microbiota composition.
