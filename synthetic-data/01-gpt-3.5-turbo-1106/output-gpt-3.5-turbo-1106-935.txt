prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: intracellular ribonucleoproteins. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: Intracellular ribonucleoproteins (RNPs) are essential molecular machines involved in the transport, processing, and regulation of RNA within eukaryotic cells. This multi-subunit complex is crucial for the maintenance of cellular homeostasis by ensuring proper mRNA localization, stability, and translation. Dysregulation of intracellular RNPs has been associated with a myriad of human diseases, including autoimmune disorders and neurodegenerative conditions. Recent studies have demonstrated that post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation and ubiquitination, play a critical role in regulating the function and subcellular localization of intracellular RNPs. In addition, small molecule inhibitors targeting the activity of intracellular RNPs have shown promising results in preclinical models, highlighting the therapeutic potential of modulating these complexes in the treatment of certain diseases. Further investigation into the intricate regulatory mechanisms governing the function of intracellular RNPs is warranted to fully comprehend their role in health and disease.
