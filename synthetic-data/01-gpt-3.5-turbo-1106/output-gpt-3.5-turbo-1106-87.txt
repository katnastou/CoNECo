prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: cytochrome bc1. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In recent years, the cytochrome bc1 complex has garnered significant attention in the research of mitochondrial function and energy metabolism. This multisubunit complex is pivotal in the electron transport chain, where it plays a crucial role in transferring electrons from ubiquinol to cytochrome c, thereby generating a proton gradient across the mitochondrial inner membrane. Dysregulation of the cytochrome bc1 complex has been implicated in various mitochondrial diseases, such as Leigh syndrome and cytochrome bc1 deficiency, highlighting its clinical significance. Moreover, the interaction of small molecules and pharmaceuticals with the cytochrome bc1 complex has been a subject of interest due to its potential therapeutic implications in the treatment of certain parasitic infections. Further investigations into the structure, function, and pharmacological targeting of the cytochrome bc1 complex hold promise for advancing our understanding of mitochondrial biology and developing novel therapeutic strategies.
