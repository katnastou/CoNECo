prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: exon-exon junction. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The exon-exon junction complex (EJC) is a critical molecular machinery involved in post-transcriptional processes. The EJC plays a key role in mRNA splicing, export, and surveillance in eukaryotic cells. Dysregulation of the EJC has been associated with various diseases, including neurodevelopmental disorders and cancer. Recent studies have elucidated the intricate interactions between the EJC and other cellular components, shedding light on its implications in cellular physiology and pathology. The EJC represents an attractive target for therapeutic interventions, and further investigations into its functional significance may provide valuable insights for the development of novel treatment strategies for EJC-associated diseases.
