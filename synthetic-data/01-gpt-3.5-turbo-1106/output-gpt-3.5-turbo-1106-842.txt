prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: cytoplasmic dynein heavy chains. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The cytoplasmic dynein heavy chains are essential components of the dynein protein complex, which plays a crucial role in intracellular transport processes. Dysfunction of this protein complex has been implicated in a variety of neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Additionally, studies have revealed that chemical compounds targeting the cytoplasmic dynein heavy chains may hold potential for therapeutic interventions in these diseases. Furthermore, investigations into the interaction between the cytoplasmic dynein heavy chains and microtubules have shed light on the molecular mechanisms underlying intracellular transport, providing valuable insights for the development of novel treatment strategies.
