prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: C/D snoRNP. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: Recent studies have highlighted the intricate role of the C/D snoRNP in the pathogenesis of spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), a hereditary neuromuscular disorder associated with mutations in the SMN1 gene. Through comprehensive analysis of RNA-protein interactions, it has been demonstrated that dysregulation of C/D snoRNP assembly and function contributes to the aberrant splicing events observed in SMA-affected tissues. Furthermore, the identification of small molecule modulators targeting the integrity of C/D snoRNP complexes holds promise for the development of novel therapeutic strategies aimed at ameliorating the molecular perturbations underlying SMA. These findings shed light on the potential significance of C/D snoRNP as a putative target for therapeutic intervention in neuromuscular disorders.
