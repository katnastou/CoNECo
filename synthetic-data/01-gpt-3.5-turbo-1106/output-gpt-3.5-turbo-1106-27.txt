prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: import inner membrane translocase. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The import inner membrane translocase (IMT) is a key component of the protein import machinery in mitochondria. The IMT complex plays a critical role in facilitating the translocation of nuclear-encoded precursor proteins across the inner mitochondrial membrane. Dysregulation of the IMT complex has been implicated in various mitochondrial disorders, such as Leigh syndrome and Barth syndrome, highlighting its significance in maintaining mitochondrial function. Recent studies have begun to elucidate the structural and functional properties of the IMT complex, shedding light on potential therapeutic targets for addressing mitochondrial import deficiencies. Further investigation into the IMT complex and its associated regulatory mechanisms may provide valuable insights into the pathogenesis of mitochondrial diseases and pave the way for the development of targeted interventions to ameliorate their clinical manifestations.
