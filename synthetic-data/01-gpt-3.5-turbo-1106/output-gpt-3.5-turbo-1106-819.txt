prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: methane monooxygenase. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: Methane monooxygenase is a key enzymatic complex responsible for the oxidation of methane to MeOH and eventually to formaldehyde in methanotrophic organisms. This critical step in the global carbon cycle is fundamental to understanding methane metabolism and has significant implications for bioremediation of methane-polluted environments. Recent studies have elucidated the structural and functional aspects of methane monooxygenase, shedding light on its catalytic mechanism and potential applications in biotechnological processes. Furthermore, the role of methane monooxygenase in the context of climate change and its potential as a target for drug development in combating methane-related diseases highlight the importance of continued research in this field.
