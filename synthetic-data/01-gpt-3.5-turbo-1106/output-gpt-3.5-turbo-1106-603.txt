prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: MitOSs. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we aimed to investigate the role of MitOSs in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease. Through a series of in vitro experiments, we examined the interaction between MitOSs and alpha-synuclein, a key protein implicated in the neurodegenerative processes of Parkinson's disease. Our findings revealed a direct association between MitOSs and alpha-synuclein, suggesting a potential regulatory role of MitOSs in the aggregation and accumulation of alpha-synuclein in neuronal cells. Furthermore, we observed an altered mitochondrial function in cells overexpressing alpha-synuclein, accompanied by a reduction in MitOSs levels. These results highlight a novel link between MitOSs and alpha-synuclein, shedding light on the potential implications of MitOSs dysregulation in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease.
