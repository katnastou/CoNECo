prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: cAMP-dependent protein kinase. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: Activation of the cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) plays a crucial role in numerous cellular processes by phosphorylating a wide array of target proteins. The regulation of PKA activity is contingent upon the intracellular levels of adenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate (cAMP), which are modulated by the activity of adenylate cyclase enzymes. Dysregulation of PKA signaling has been implicated in various pathological conditions, including cardiovascular diseases, cancer, and metabolic disorders. Targeted pharmacological interventions aimed at modulating PKA activity hold promise for the treatment of these diseases. Further investigation into the intricate network of PKA substrates and its regulatory mechanisms is essential for identifying novel therapeutic strategies to modulate PKA signaling in disease states.
