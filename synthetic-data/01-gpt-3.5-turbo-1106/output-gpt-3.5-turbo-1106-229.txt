prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: laminin-421. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The role of laminin-421 in the pathogenesis of diabetic nephropathy is a subject of great interest in current biomedical research. It has been observed that the expression of laminin-421 is upregulated in diabetic kidney disease, suggesting its involvement in the pathophysiology of this condition. Studies have also demonstrated that laminin-421 interacts with various cellular receptors, such as integrins, leading to the activation of intracellular signaling cascades that contribute to the development and progression of diabetic nephropathy. Moreover, the absence of laminin-421 has been associated with reduced glomerular basement membrane integrity, leading to an increased susceptibility to albuminuria and glomerulosclerosis. Understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying the association between laminin-421 and diabetic nephropathy may provide novel insights for the development of targeted therapeutic interventions for this debilitating condition.
