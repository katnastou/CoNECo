prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: light harvesting complex I. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In recent years, there has been increased interest in studying the role of the light harvesting complex I (LHCI) in photosynthesis in various organisms. LHCI is a key protein complex involved in the absorption and transfer of light energy in photosynthetic organisms, such as plants and algae. The complex consists of multiple subunits that interact with chlorophyll and carotenoid pigments to efficiently harvest light energy and transfer it to the reaction center of photosystem I. Understanding the structural and functional characteristics of LHCI is crucial for elucidating the mechanisms of light energy capture and conversion in photosynthetic organisms, and for the development of novel approaches for improving photosynthetic efficiency in crops and algae for sustainable energy production and biomass formation.
