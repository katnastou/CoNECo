prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: epsilon DNA polymerases. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In recent years, the epsilon DNA polymerases complex has emerged as a key player in the mechanisms underlying genomic stability. Studies have shown that this complex plays a crucial role in DNA replication fidelity and repair processes, making it a potential target for therapeutic interventions in cancer and genetic diseases. Advances in our understanding of the interactions between epsilon DNA polymerases and various regulatory factors have shed light on its intricate involvement in maintaining the integrity of the genome. Furthermore, investigations into the dysregulation of this complex have revealed its potential implications in the development and progression of various human diseases, including cancer and neurodegenerative disorders. These findings highlight the significance of elucidating the molecular mechanisms governing the function of the epsilon DNA polymerases complex and its potential as a therapeutic target for a wide range of diseases.
