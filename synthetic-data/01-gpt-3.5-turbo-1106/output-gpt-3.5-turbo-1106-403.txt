prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: Polycomb repressive complex 1. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In recent years, much attention has been focused on the role of the Polycomb repressive complex 1 (PRC1) in the regulation of gene expression and development. Studies have highlighted the crucial functions of PRC1 in various organisms, including humans, and its implication in the pathogenesis of multiple diseases, such as cancer and developmental disorders. The intricate interplay between PRC1 and other epigenetic regulators, as well as the dynamic modulation of its activity by small molecule inhibitors, have sparked substantial interest in targeting PRC1 for therapeutic interventions. Furthermore, the diverse subunit composition and combinatorial assembly of PRC1 variants in different cell types and developmental stages have drawn attention to the complexity of PRC1-mediated epigenetic regulation, underscoring the need for further investigation into these molecular intricacies.
