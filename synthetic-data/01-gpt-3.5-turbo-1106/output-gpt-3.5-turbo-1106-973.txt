prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: cytosolic small ribosomal subunit. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we investigated the role of the cytosolic small ribosomal subunit in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease. Using a transgenic mouse model overexpressing mutant amyloid precursor protein, we observed a significant increase in the association of the cytosolic small ribosomal subunit with beta-amyloid plaques in the hippocampus. Furthermore, we identified a novel small molecule inhibitor that selectively disrupts the interaction between the cytosolic small ribosomal subunit and beta-amyloid, leading to a reduction in neuroinflammation and improved cognitive function in the mice. Our findings suggest that targeting the cytosolic small ribosomal subunit may hold promise for therapeutic interventions in Alzheimer's disease.
