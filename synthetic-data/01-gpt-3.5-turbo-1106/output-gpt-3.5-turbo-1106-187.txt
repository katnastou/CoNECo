prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: methyl accepting chemotaxis protein. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The role of the methyl accepting chemotaxis protein (MCP) complex in bacterial chemotaxis has long been studied due to its critical function in enabling bacteria to sense and respond to external chemical gradients. Recent studies have investigated the interactions between the MCP complex and various chemotaxis ligands, such as attractants and repellents, to elucidate the mechanisms underlying the swarming behavior of pathogenic bacteria. Furthermore, the MCP complex has been implicated in the pathogenesis of certain infectious diseases, highlighting the potential for targeted disruption of MCP-dependent chemotaxis as a novel therapeutic strategy. Understanding the molecular underpinnings of MCP complex-mediated chemotaxis could provide valuable insights into the development of interventions to modulate bacterial motility and pathogenicity.
