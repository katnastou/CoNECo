prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: CPC. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The chromosomal passenger complex (CPC) is a critical regulator of cell division and has been implicated in various human diseases, including cancer. The protein complex comprises four subunits, namely Aurora B kinase, INCENP, Survivin, and Borealin, and is responsible for coordinating chromosomal segregation and cytokinesis during mitosis. Dysfunction of the CPC has been associated with abnormal cell division, leading to aneuploidy and genomic instability, which are hallmarks of cancer development. Furthermore, aberrant CPC activity has been observed in various malignancies, making it a potential therapeutic target for cancer treatment. The study of CPC-related mechanisms and dysregulation may provide valuable insights into the pathogenesis of cancer and contribute to the development of novel therapeutic strategies.
