prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: FceRI. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In recent years, the FceRI protein complex has garnered attention for its pivotal role in mediating allergic responses in humans. Upon exposure to allergens, FceRI, a high-affinity receptor for the Fc region of immunoglobulin E (IgE), becomes activated and initiates a cascade of signaling events leading to the release of inflammatory mediators from mast cells and basophils. This process, known as degranulation, contributes to the pathogenesis of allergic diseases such as asthma, eczema, and allergic rhinitis. Researchers have identified potential therapeutic targets within the FceRI signaling pathway, aiming to develop interventions that modulate its activity and mitigate allergic symptoms. Moreover, elucidating the regulatory mechanisms controlling FceRI expression and function holds promise for the development of novel strategies for the treatment of allergic conditions.
