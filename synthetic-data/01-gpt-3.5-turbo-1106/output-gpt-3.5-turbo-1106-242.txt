prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: GimC. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we investigated the functional role of the GimC protein complex in the progression of Huntington's disease. Using a transgenic mouse model, we observed a significant upregulation of GimC in the striatum, a key brain region affected by the disease. Furthermore, our findings demonstrated that the inhibition of GimC activity led to a reduction in the accumulation of toxic protein aggregates associated with Huntington's disease pathology. These results suggest that targeting GimC may offer a potential therapeutic strategy for mitigating the neurodegenerative effects of Huntington's disease. Our study sheds light on the intricate interplay between protein complexes and disease pathogenesis, providing a promising avenue for future investigations in the field of neurodegenerative disorders.
