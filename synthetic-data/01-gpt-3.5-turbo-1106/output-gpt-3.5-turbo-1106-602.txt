prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: GGR. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The GGR protein complex is a crucial component of the nucleotide excision repair (NER) pathway, which plays a vital role in maintaining genomic stability and preventing mutagenesis. In this study, we investigated the role of GGR in the repair of UV-induced DNA damage in human skin fibroblasts. Our results demonstrate that the depletion of GGR leads to increased accumulation of UV-induced DNA lesions and impairs the efficiency of NER. Furthermore, we observed that cells lacking functional GGR exhibit heightened sensitivity to UV radiation, as evidenced by increased apoptosis and decreased cell viability. These findings provide valuable insights into the essential function of the GGR protein complex in protecting cells against UV-induced DNA damage and highlight its potential as a therapeutic target for skin cancer prevention and treatment.
