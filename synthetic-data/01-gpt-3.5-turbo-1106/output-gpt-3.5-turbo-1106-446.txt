prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: type II restriction enzyme. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The type II restriction enzyme has been the subject of extensive study for its potential role in the defense mechanisms of bacteria against viral infections. In particular, its activity on certain DNA sequences has been linked to cellular responses to various viral agents. Recent investigations have suggested a possible connection between the type II restriction enzyme and the regulation of gene expression in response to viral infection. Furthermore, the enzyme has been implicated in the development of therapeutics targeting viral diseases, such as hepatitis and influenza. These findings provide valuable insights into the potential use of the type II restriction enzyme as a target for antiviral drug development and highlight its significance in combating viral infections.
