prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: histone acetylases. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In recent years, there has been increasing interest in the role of histone acetylases in the pathogenesis of various diseases, including cancer and neurodegenerative disorders. Histone acetylases are enzymes that catalyze the addition of acetyl groups to histone proteins, potentially altering chromatin structure and gene expression. The dysregulation of histone acetylases has been implicated in the development and progression of cancer, as well as in the pathophysiology of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's. Research efforts aimed at understanding the mechanisms underlying the aberrant expression and activity of histone acetylases may provide valuable insights for the development of targeted therapeutic interventions for these devastating conditions.
