prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: carbamoyl phosphate synthetase. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The carbamoyl phosphate synthetase is a key enzyme complex involved in the de novo biosynthesis of pyrimidine nucleotides in various organisms. Mutations in the genes encoding the subunits of carbamoyl phosphate synthetase have been implicated in some cases of hereditary metabolic disorders, such as carbamoyl phosphate synthetase I deficiency. This disorder can lead to elevated levels of ammonia in the blood and neurological symptoms. Inhibition of carbamoyl phosphate synthetase has been explored as a potential therapeutic strategy for certain parasitic infections, given its essential role in the pyrimidine biosynthetic pathway. Understanding the regulation and function of carbamoyl phosphate synthetase is crucial for developing targeted treatments for metabolic disorders and infectious diseases.
