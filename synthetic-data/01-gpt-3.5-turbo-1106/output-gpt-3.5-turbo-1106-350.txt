prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: cellulose synthase. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The cellulose synthase protein complex has been the subject of extensive research due to its critical role in the biosynthesis of cellulose, an essential component of plant cell walls. Recent studies have elucidated the regulatory mechanisms governing the assembly and activity of cellulose synthase, shedding light on how the complex contributes to the structural integrity and mechanical strength of plant tissues. Furthermore, investigations into the interactions between cellulose synthase and various chemical modulators have provided valuable insights into potential targets for enhancing cellulose production for industrial and agricultural applications. These findings have significant implications for the development of strategies to address the global demand for renewable bio-based materials and biofuels.
