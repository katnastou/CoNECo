prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: ESCRT II. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The endosomal sorting complex required for transport (ESCRT) is a highly conserved cellular machinery involved in the recognition and sorting of ubiquitinated transmembrane proteins into multivesicular bodies for lysosomal degradation. The ESCRT machinery comprises four distinct complexes, with ESCRT II being a key player in mediating membrane deformation and cargo sorting. Dysfunction of ESCRT II has been implicated in various human diseases, including viral infections, neurodegenerative disorders, and certain cancers. Recent studies have highlighted the role of small molecule inhibitors in modulating the function of ESCRT II, offering potential therapeutic avenues for the treatment of diseases associated with aberrant endosomal sorting. Further investigation into the molecular mechanisms underlying ESCRT II function and dysregulation will be crucial for elucidating its role in disease pathogenesis and for developing targeted interventions.
