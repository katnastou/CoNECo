prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: nuclear cohesin. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The nuclear cohesin protein complex plays a critical role in maintaining genomic stability and proper chromosome segregation during cell division. Dysfunction of the nuclear cohesin complex has been implicated in various human diseases such as Cornelia de Lange syndrome and certain types of cancer. Recent studies have highlighted the interaction between the nuclear cohesin complex and the chromatin structure, uncovering the potential regulatory roles of cohesin in gene expression and DNA repair processes. Additionally, the differential localization of nuclear cohesin in various cell types and its dynamic associations with other chromatin-binding factors indicate its multifaceted functions in controlling cellular homeostasis. Understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying the nuclear cohesin complex's activity is essential for elucidating its significance in normal cellular function and its potential as a therapeutic target for disease intervention.
