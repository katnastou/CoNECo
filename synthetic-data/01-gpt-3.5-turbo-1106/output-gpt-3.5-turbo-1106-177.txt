prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: oxidoreductases. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The role of oxidoreductases in oxidative stress and age-related neurodegenerative diseases has been a topic of significant interest in current biomedical research. Oxidoreductases are a diverse group of enzymes involved in the transfer of electrons during redox reactions. Recent studies have shown that dysregulation of oxidoreductases contributes to an increased production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the brain, leading to oxidative damage and neuronal dysfunction. Emerging evidence suggests that targeting oxidoreductases may have potential therapeutic implications in the management of age-related neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's and Parkinson's. Thus, further investigation into the specific mechanisms by which oxidoreductases modulate oxidative stress is warranted, with the aim of identifying novel therapeutic targets for the treatment of neurodegenerative disorders.
