prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: FAS. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: Recent research has shed light on the role of the FAS protein complex in the regulation of cellular lipid metabolism. It has been established that activation of the FAS complex is instrumental in the biosynthesis of fatty acids, and its dysregulation has been implicated in the pathogenesis of various metabolic disorders such as obesity and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. The intricate interplay of signaling pathways involving FAS has also been implicated in the progression of certain types of cancer, highlighting the potential of targeting this complex for therapeutic interventions. Moreover, the cross-talk between FAS and other molecular entities involved in lipid metabolism presents a promising avenue for future investigations to uncover novel treatment strategies for metabolic disturbances and related disorders.
