prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: NatA. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we aimed to elucidate the functional role of the NatA protein complex in the pathogenesis of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Using a combination of bioinformatics analyses and in vitro experiments, we demonstrated that the dysregulation of NatA activity is associated with aberrant acetylation of critical substrates involved in protein homeostasis, mitochondrial function, and cellular stress response pathways in neuronal cells. Furthermore, we found that genetic manipulation of NatA expression levels in a transgenic ALS mouse model resulted in altered disease progression and motor dysfunction. Our findings shed light on the potential significance of NatA as a novel therapeutic target for ALS and provide valuable insights into the intricate molecular mechanisms underlying neurodegenerative disorders.
