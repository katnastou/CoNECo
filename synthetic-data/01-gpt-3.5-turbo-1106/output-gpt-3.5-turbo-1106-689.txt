prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: VEGF-As. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we investigated the regulatory role of VEGF-As in the progression of diabetic retinopathy, a common complication of diabetes. We explored the interaction between VEGF-As and its receptor, VEGFR, in the context of retinal angiogenesis. Utilizing an animal model of diabetes, we observed increased expression of VEGF-As in the retinal tissue, accompanied by elevated levels of oxygen free radicals and pro-inflammatory cytokines. Furthermore, our results revealed a significant upregulation of VEGF-As in response to hyperglycemia, suggesting a potential link between VEGF-As and the pathogenesis of diabetic retinopathy. These findings highlight the intricate involvement of VEGF-As in the development of retinal vascular abnormalities associated with diabetic retinopathy, paving the way for novel therapeutic strategies targeting this protein complex.
