prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: supraspliceosomes. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In recent decades, the role of the supraspliceosomes, large ribonucleoprotein complexes involved in nuclear pre-mRNA splicing, has garnered significant attention in the field of molecular biology. These multiprotein complexes exhibit a remarkable complexity and play a crucial role in modulating alternative splicing patterns, thus contributing to an extensive repertoire of proteins that can be generated from a single gene. Interestingly, dysregulation of supraspliceosome activity has been implicated in several human diseases, including various forms of cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, and viral infections. Understanding the intricate mechanisms governing supraspliceosome function holds great promise for the development of targeted therapeutic interventions aimed at correcting splicing abnormalities associated with these pathologies.
