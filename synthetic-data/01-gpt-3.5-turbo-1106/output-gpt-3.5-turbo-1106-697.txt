prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: T lymphocyte receptor. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: Recent studies have shed light on the regulatory role of phosphorylation in the T lymphocyte receptor complex. This essential protein complex is crucial for the activation of T lymphocytes in the adaptive immune response. The phosphorylation of specific tyrosine residues within the T lymphocyte receptor has been found to be a key mechanism for modulating its function, allowing for precise signal transduction upon recognition of antigens presented by antigen-presenting cells. Dysregulation of T lymphocyte receptor phosphorylation has been implicated in various autoimmune diseases, underscoring the significance of understanding the molecular regulation of this complex for the development of targeted therapeutic interventions. Further investigation into the intricacies of T lymphocyte receptor phosphorylation could offer novel insights into the pathophysiology of immune-related disorders and inform the design of innovative treatment strategies.
