prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: AMPK. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is a pivotal regulatory complex involved in cellular energy homeostasis. Upon activation, AMPK phosphorylates key target molecules, such as acetyl-CoA carboxylase and HMG-CoA reductase, thereby modulating lipid and cholesterol synthesis. Moreover, AMPK activation has been shown to exert beneficial effects in various disease models, including type 2 diabetes and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. Multiple upstream kinases, such as liver kinase B1 (LKB1) and calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase kinase 2 (CaMKK2), have been identified to converge on AMPK, highlighting the complexity of AMPK regulation. The development of small molecule activators of AMPK, such as 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide ribonucleotide (AICAR) and metformin, holds promise as potential therapeutics for metabolic disorders and cardiovascular diseases. Further exploration of AMPK signaling pathways and its crosstalk with other metabolic regulators may offer novel therapeutic strategies for metabolic syndrome and related disorders.
