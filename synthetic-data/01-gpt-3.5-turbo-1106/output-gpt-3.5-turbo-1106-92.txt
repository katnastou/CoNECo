prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: collagen type IV trimers. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The extracellular matrix (ECM) is a complex structure composed of various proteins, glycoproteins, and proteoglycans that play critical roles in the maintenance of tissue architecture and homeostasis. Collagen type IV trimers are major components of the basement membrane, a specialized form of ECM found in various tissues, including the kidney glomerulus and the vascular system. Mutations in genes encoding proteins involved in the assembly and stability of collagen type IV trimers have been associated with a group of heterogeneous disorders known as collagen IV-related nephropathies, which are characterized by progressive renal dysfunction and multi-organ involvement. Understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying the assembly and regulation of collagen type IV trimers is crucial for developing targeted therapeutic approaches for these debilitating conditions.
