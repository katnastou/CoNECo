prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: FtsQBL. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The FtsQBL complex plays a crucial role in the formation and constriction of the cytokinetic Z ring during bacterial cell division. The interaction between FtsQ, FtsB, and FtsL has been extensively characterized in various bacterial species. The FtsQBL complex is instrumental in coordinating the assembly of the divison machinery and ensuring accurate segregation of genetic material. Disruption of the FtsQBL complex has been linked to defects in cell division, leading to the formation of aberrant cell shapes and impaired growth in bacterial populations. Understanding the precise molecular mechanisms underlying the function of the FtsQBL complex is essential for developing targeted antimicrobial strategies to combat bacterial infections and combat multidrug-resistant pathogens.
