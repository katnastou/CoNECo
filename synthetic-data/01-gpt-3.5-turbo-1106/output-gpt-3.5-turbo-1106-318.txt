prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: glucose transporter. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: Glucose transporters play a crucial role in the regulation of glucose homeostasis in various organisms, including humans. Dysregulation of the glucose transporter complex has been implicated in various metabolic disorders such as diabetes mellitus. In recent years, there has been a growing interest in understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying the function of the glucose transporter complex and its implications in disease pathology. This complex has been the subject of extensive research, with new insights emerging regarding its structural organization and functional characteristics. Furthermore, studies have explored the potential therapeutic applications targeting the glucose transporter complex to modulate glucose uptake and ameliorate metabolic dysregulation. Overall, the glucose transporter complex represents a promising target for biomedical research aimed at improving our understanding of metabolic diseases and developing novel therapeutic interventions.
