prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: platelet-derived growth factor receptor-ligand. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we investigated the role of the platelet-derived growth factor receptor-ligand complex in the pathogenesis of pulmonary fibrosis. Our results demonstrate a significant upregulation of the platelet-derived growth factor receptor-ligand complex in lung tissue samples obtained from patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis compared to control samples. Furthermore, our in vitro experiments revealed that inhibition of the platelet-derived growth factor receptor-ligand complex using small molecule inhibitors resulted in a reduction of fibroblast proliferation and collagen deposition. These findings suggest a potential therapeutic strategy targeting the platelet-derived growth factor receptor-ligand complex in the treatment of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.
