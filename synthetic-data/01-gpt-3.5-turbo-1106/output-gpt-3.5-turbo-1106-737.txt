prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: IgD B cell receptors. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The role of IgD B cell receptors in the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases has been a topic of increasing interest. Studies have demonstrated that the activation of IgD B cell receptors is associated with the dysregulation of immune responses in conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis and systemic lupus erythematosus. This finding has led to an exploration of potential therapeutic interventions targeting the signaling pathways mediated by IgD B cell receptors. Furthermore, investigations into the interplay between IgD B cell receptors and cytokine networks have provided new insights into the immunopathogenesis of these disorders. Understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying the involvement of IgD B cell receptors in autoimmune diseases may offer opportunities for the development of novel and effective treatments.
