prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: phosphoribosylpyrophosphate synthetase. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: Phosphoribosylpyrophosphate synthetase (PRS) plays a pivotal role in the de novo biosynthesis of purine nucleotides and it is a crucial enzyme for cellular metabolism. Dysregulation of PRS activity has been linked to various pathological conditions such as gout, Lesch-Nyhan syndrome, and neoplastic transformation. The intricate regulation of PRS involves allosteric control and post-translational modifications, highlighting its importance in maintaining cellular homeostasis. Utilizing biochemical and structural approaches, researchers have gained insight into the intricate catalytic mechanism of PRS, providing a foundation for the development of novel therapeutic strategies aimed at targeting PRS-related disorders. Furthermore, PRS has been identified as a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of certain cancers, making it an attractive avenue for further investigation in the field of oncology.
