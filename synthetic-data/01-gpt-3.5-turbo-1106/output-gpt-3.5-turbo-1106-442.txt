prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: YdcSTUV. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The YdcSTUV protein complex, found in bacterial species such as Escherichia coli, has been implicated in the regulation of cell envelope integrity and stress response. Previous studies have shown that disruption of the YdcSTUV complex leads to increased susceptibility to antibiotic damage and environmental stressors. Furthermore, this complex has been associated with the modulation of virulence factors in pathogenic strains of E. coli, suggesting a potential role in the development of bacterial infections. The current study aimed to investigate the interactions between small molecule compounds and the YdcSTUV complex, with the goal of identifying potential therapeutic targets for combating antibiotic resistance and controlling bacterial infections. Through a combination of computational modeling and in vitro assays, we identified several candidate compounds that showed promising binding affinity to the YdcSTUV complex. The findings lay the groundwork for further exploration of these compounds as potential drug leads for the treatment of bacterial infections.
