prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: TGFbeta1 ligand-receptor. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we investigated the role of the TGFbeta1 ligand-receptor complex in the pathogenesis of fibrotic diseases, such as pulmonary fibrosis. Our experiments demonstrated that activation of the TGFbeta1 ligand-receptor complex led to increased expression of extracellular matrix proteins, such as collagen and fibronectin, in pulmonary fibroblasts. Additionally, we found that inhibition of the TGFbeta1 ligand-receptor complex using a small molecule antagonist resulted in decreased fibrotic marker expression and attenuated fibrotic changes in a murine model of pulmonary fibrosis. These findings suggest that targeting the TGFbeta1 ligand-receptor complex may offer a promising therapeutic strategy for the treatment of fibrotic diseases.
