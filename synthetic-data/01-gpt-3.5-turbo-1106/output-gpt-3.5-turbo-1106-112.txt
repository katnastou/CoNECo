prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: nuclear ubiquitin ligases. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: A growing body of evidence suggests that nuclear ubiquitin ligases play a critical role in the regulation of cell signaling pathways and maintenance of genome integrity. Dysregulation of these protein complexes has been associated with various human diseases, including cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, and autoimmune conditions. Recent studies have implicated the involvement of nuclear ubiquitin ligases in the degradation of key regulatory proteins, such as transcription factors and DNA repair enzymes, highlighting their importance in cellular homeostasis. Further investigation into the specific molecular mechanisms underlying the function of these ligases may provide valuable insights into potential therapeutic strategies for targeting diseases linked to their dysfunction.
