prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: calcineurin. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The role of the calcineurin protein complex in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease has been extensively studied in recent years. In this study, we investigate the potential regulatory role of calcineurin in the inflammatory response in microglial cells. Our results indicate that calcineurin activation is associated with increased expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1β and TNF-α in response to amyloid-β exposure. Furthermore, inhibition of calcineurin activity using the specific inhibitor cyclosporine A led to a significant reduction in the production of these cytokines. These findings suggest that calcineurin may function as a key mediator of neuroinflammation in Alzheimer's disease and highlight its potential as a therapeutic target for modulating microglial activation in the context of neurodegenerative diseases.
