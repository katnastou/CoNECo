prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: PKS. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The polyketide synthase (PKS) is a multifunctional enzyme complex found in various organisms, including bacteria and fungi, responsible for the biosynthesis of complex polyketide natural products. These products have demonstrated diverse pharmacological activities, such as anticancer, antibiotic, and immunosuppressive effects. PKSs are involved in the production of structurally diverse compounds with potential therapeutic applications. Understanding the enzymatic mechanisms and structural features of PKSs provides valuable insights into the rational engineering of novel bioactive compounds. Research on the regulation of PKS activity and the development of PKS inhibitors presents promising opportunities for drug discovery and the treatment of various diseases.
