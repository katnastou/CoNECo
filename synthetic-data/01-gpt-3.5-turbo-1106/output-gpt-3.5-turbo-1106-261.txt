prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: Serine/threonine-protein phosphatase 2A. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: Serine/threonine-protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) has been implicated in various cellular processes, including cell cycle regulation, signal transduction, and tumorigenesis. Dysregulation of PP2A function has been associated with the development and progression of several human diseases, including cancer and neurodegenerative disorders. Recent studies have revealed the intricate regulatory mechanisms governing PP2A activity, including its interaction with small molecule modulators and post-translational modifications. Moreover, the identification of specific PP2A binding partners and substrates has provided insights into its diverse biological functions. Given its importance in human health and disease, understanding the complex regulatory network of PP2A may present new opportunities for targeted therapeutic interventions.
