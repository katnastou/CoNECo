prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: surface IgG2a. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we investigated the role of the surface IgG2a protein complex in the context of lupus nephritis. Using a murine model, we examined the expression and localization of surface IgG2a in kidney tissue, as well as its association with disease progression. Our findings revealed a significant upregulation of surface IgG2a in the kidneys of lupus nephritis-afflicted mice, particularly in the glomerular region. Furthermore, we observed a positive correlation between the abundance of surface IgG2a and the severity of renal damage. These results suggest that surface IgG2a may potentially serve as a biomarker for monitoring the progression of lupus nephritis and could be a target for therapeutic intervention in this autoimmune disease.
