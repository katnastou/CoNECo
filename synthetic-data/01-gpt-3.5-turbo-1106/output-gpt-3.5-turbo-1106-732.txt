prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: ssuABC. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The ssuABC protein complex has been reported to play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of Salmonella Typhimurium infections. Recent studies have demonstrated that the absence of the ssuABC complex leads to a significant reduction in the virulence of Salmonella Typhimurium in murine models. Additionally, it has been observed that ssuABC-deficient Salmonella show impaired intracellular survival within macrophages. Furthermore, the absence of the ssuABC complex correlates with decreased expression of key virulence factors in Salmonella Typhimurium. These findings highlight the importance of the ssuABC complex in the pathogenicity of Salmonella infections and suggest that targeting this complex may offer potential therapeutic strategies for controlling Salmonella-related diseases.
