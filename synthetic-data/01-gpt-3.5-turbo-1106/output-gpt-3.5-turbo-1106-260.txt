prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: Dihydroxyacetone kinases. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we investigated the role of the Dihydroxyacetone kinases (DHAKs) in the cellular metabolism of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Our findings suggest that DHAKs are involved in the phosphorylation of dihydroxyacetone, a key intermediate in the glycerol biosynthetic pathway. Through a combination of genetic and biochemical analyses, we have identified potential interactions between DHAKs and other enzymes implicated in the regulation of glycerol metabolism. Furthermore, our results indicate that DHAK activity is essential for the proper response to osmotic stress in yeast cells. These insights into the function of DHAKs provide valuable information for understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying glycerol metabolism and its implications for cellular adaptation to environmental changes. This work has broader implications for the study of metabolic pathways and potential targets for therapeutic intervention in diseases associated with dysregulated glycerol metabolism.
