prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: WASH-C. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The WASH-C complex, composed of WASH and its associated proteins, has been implicated in various physiological processes, including endosomal trafficking and actin cytoskeleton remodeling. Dysregulation of WASH-C has been linked to multiple human diseases, such as cancer and neurological disorders. A recent study demonstrated that the WASH-C complex plays a crucial role in the membrane trafficking of glycoproteins, providing novel insights into its functions in cellular homeostasis. Furthermore, the identification of small molecule modulators targeting WASH-C components has spurred interest in exploring therapeutic interventions for diseases associated with aberrant WASH-C activity. This research underscores the potential significance of the WASH-C complex as a promising target for drug development in the treatment of various disorders.
