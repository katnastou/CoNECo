prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: syntrophin. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The role of the syntrophin protein complex in Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) has been the focus of intense investigation due to its potential as a therapeutic target. Previous studies have shown that the syntrophin complex is involved in the stabilization and localization of neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) at the sarcolemma, contributing to the regulation of skeletal muscle blood flow and contractile function. Furthermore, dysregulation of the syntrophin complex has been implicated in the pathogenesis of DMD, leading to muscle degeneration and weakness. In this study, we aimed to elucidate the molecular interactions of the syntrophin complex in dystrophic muscle tissue, and to assess the potential of targeting this complex for therapeutic intervention in DMD. Our findings demonstrate aberrant syntrophin complex assembly and dysregulated binding to nNOS in dystrophic muscle, providing new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis of DMD and highlighting the syntrophin complex as a promising therapeutic target for future drug development.
