prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: SALSA. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we investigated the role of the SALSA protein complex in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease. We found that the expression of the SALSA complex was significantly elevated in the substantia nigra of Parkinson's disease patients compared to healthy controls. Using immunohistochemistry, we observed co-localization of SALSA with alpha-synuclein aggregates, suggesting a potential interaction between SALSA and alpha-synuclein in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease. Furthermore, treatment with a specific inhibitor of SALSA complex activity resulted in a decrease in neuroinflammation and dopaminergic neuronal loss in a mouse model of Parkinson's disease. Our results provide new insights into the role of the SALSA complex in the pathophysiology of Parkinson's disease and may lead to the development of novel therapeutic approaches targeting this protein complex.
