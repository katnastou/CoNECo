prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: telomere cap. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The telomere cap is known to play a critical role in maintaining genomic stability by protecting chromosome ends from degradation and fusion. Recent studies have revealed a potential connection between the dysfunction of the telomere cap and age-related diseases, such as cancer and cardiovascular conditions. In this study, we aim to elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying the maintenance and regulation of the telomere cap in human cells. Through the use of advanced imaging techniques and biochemical assays, we aim to identify novel factors involved in telomere cap stability and explore their potential as therapeutic targets for age-related diseases. Additionally, we will investigate the impact of small molecule inhibitors on telomere cap function, with the goal of developing novel approaches for the treatment of telomere-related disorders.
