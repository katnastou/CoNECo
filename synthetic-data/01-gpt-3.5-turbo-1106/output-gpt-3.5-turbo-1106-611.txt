prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: polkadots. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: A growing body of evidence suggests an intricate role of the polkadots protein complex in the progression of multiple myeloma, a hematologic malignancy characterized by the uncontrolled proliferation of plasma cells. Through a series of in vitro studies using human myeloma cell lines, it has been demonstrated that the polkadots complex plays a crucial role in the regulation of cell cycle progression and survival. Furthermore, pharmacological inhibition of the polkadots complex using small molecule inhibitors resulted in a significant reduction in myeloma cell viability, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target. These findings provide valuable insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying multiple myeloma pathogenesis and identify the polkadots complex as a promising target for the development of novel anti-myeloma therapies.
