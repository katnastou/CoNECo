prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: M-calpains. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In recent studies, the role of the M-calpains protein complex in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases has garnered significant attention. The dysregulation of M-calpains has been linked to the progression of Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and Huntington's disease. Aberrant activation of M-calpains has been observed in post-mortem brain tissue from individuals with these neurodegenerative conditions, implicating the involvement of M-calpains in the proteolytic processing of key neuronal proteins. Furthermore, the aberrant activation of M-calpains has been shown to drive neuronal cell death, exacerbating the progression of these debilitating conditions. These findings underscore the potential of targeting M-calpains as a promising therapeutic strategy for mitigating neurodegenerative diseases.
