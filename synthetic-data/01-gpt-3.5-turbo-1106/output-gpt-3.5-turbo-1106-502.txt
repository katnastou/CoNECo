prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: IL23A. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The IL23A protein complex has been the focus of intense research due to its role in the pathogenesis of various autoimmune diseases. Recent studies have demonstrated that IL23A is involved in the differentiation and expansion of T helper 17 (Th17) cells, which are implicated in the development of inflammatory conditions such as psoriasis, rheumatoid arthritis, and inflammatory bowel disease. Furthermore, the dysregulation of IL23A signaling has been linked to the progression of certain malignancies, including colorectal cancer and melanoma. Given its pivotal role in immune responses and disease development, IL23A has emerged as a promising therapeutic target for the treatment of autoimmune and inflammatory disorders. Understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying IL23A-mediated pathways may provide valuable insights for the development of novel therapeutic interventions aimed at modulating aberrant immune responses and mitigating disease progression.
