prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: nodal receptor. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we investigated the role of the nodal receptor in the pathogenesis of pulmonary fibrosis. Our findings demonstrated a significant upregulation of the nodal receptor in lung tissues from patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, compared to healthy controls. Furthermore, in a bleomycin-induced mouse model of pulmonary fibrosis, inhibition of the nodal receptor attenuated fibrotic processes and improved lung function. These results indicate a potential therapeutic target for pulmonary fibrosis by targeting the nodal receptor signaling pathway. Additionally, our data suggests that the nodal receptor may play a crucial role in the development of fibrotic lung diseases, presenting a promising avenue for further research and drug development.
