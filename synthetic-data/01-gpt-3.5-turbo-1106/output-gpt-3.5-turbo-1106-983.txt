prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: NADH-ubiquinone reductase. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The NADH-ubiquinone reductase is a critical part of the electron transport chain, functioning as a key complex in cellular respiration. This enzyme, encoded by nuclear genes and containing mitochondrial DNA subunits, plays a crucial role in the transfer of electrons from NADH to ubiquinone, facilitating the generation of proton motive force across the inner mitochondrial membrane. Dysfunction of the NADH-ubiquinone reductase has been implicated in various human disorders, including mitochondrial diseases such as Leigh syndrome and Leber's hereditary optic neuropathy. Furthermore, this protein complex has been a target for pharmacological interventions aiming to modulate mitochondrial function and address metabolic disorders. In light of its essential role in cellular energy production and its involvement in human pathology, further research on the NADH-ubiquinone reductase holds significant promise for advancing our understanding of mitochondrial physiology and developing therapeutic strategies for associated diseases.
