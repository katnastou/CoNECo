prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: Kat6. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In recent years, there has been growing interest in understanding the role of the Kat6 protein complex in various disease states. Previous studies have demonstrated the involvement of Kat6 in regulating epigenetic modifications associated with oncogenesis and development of certain hematological malignancies. The complex interplay between Kat6 and its interacting partners, as well as its ability to modulate gene expression, has raised questions regarding its potential as a therapeutic target for cancer. Furthermore, emerging evidence suggests a link between dysregulation of the Kat6 complex and neurodegenerative disorders, providing avenues for further investigation into its function in the central nervous system. Given the significance of Kat6 in disease pathogenesis, elucidating its molecular mechanisms and identifying small molecule modulators may hold promise for the development of novel treatments.
