prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: ATP synthases. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we investigated the role of ATP synthases in the pathogenesis of mitochondrial diseases such as Leigh syndrome. Our findings revealed a potential link between ATP synthase dysfunction and the progressive neurological deterioration observed in affected individuals. Using a combination of biochemical assays and genetic analysis in patient-derived cell lines, we demonstrated aberrant ATP synthase activity and mitochondrial membrane potential in diseased cells compared to controls. Furthermore, our data suggest that modulating ATP synthase function may represent a promising therapeutic strategy for mitochondrial disorders. This work sheds light on the critical involvement of ATP synthases in mitochondrial disease progression and underscores the importance of targeting this protein complex for future treatment interventions.
