prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: alpha-ketoglutarate-dependent taurine dioxygenases. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: Recent studies have implicated the alpha-ketoglutarate-dependent taurine dioxygenases in the regulation of hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) activity, offering potential insights into the pathogenesis of various hypoxia-related diseases. These enzymes are known to facilitate the hydroxylation of specific proline residues within the oxygen-dependent degradation domain of HIF, ultimately leading to enhanced ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation. Additionally, the expression and function of alpha-ketoglutarate-dependent taurine dioxygenases have been shown to be influenced by various chemical modulators, including iron chelators and hypoxia-mimicking agents. Consequently, targeting these enzymes may hold promise for the development of novel therapeutic interventions aimed at mitigating the effects of hypoxia in diseases such as cancer, ischemic heart disease, and neurodegenerative disorders.
