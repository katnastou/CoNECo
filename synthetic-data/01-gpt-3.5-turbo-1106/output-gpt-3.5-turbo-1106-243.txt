prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: T cell receptor. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In recent years, the T cell receptor has emerged as a key player in the immune response against various pathogens and cancer cells. Studies have shown that the interaction between the T cell receptor and peptide-MHC complexes on the surface of antigen-presenting cells plays a crucial role in the activation and differentiation of T cells. Furthermore, the signaling pathways downstream of the T cell receptor have been extensively investigated, revealing key kinases and adaptor proteins involved in T cell activation. Dysregulation of T cell receptor signaling has been implicated in the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis and multiple sclerosis. Understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying T cell receptor function is essential for the development of novel immunotherapies and vaccines for the treatment of infectious diseases and cancer.
