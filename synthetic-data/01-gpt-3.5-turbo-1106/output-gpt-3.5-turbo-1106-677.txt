prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: RFA. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we investigated the role of the RFA protein complex in the progression of colorectal cancer. Utilizing patient tissue samples, we analyzed the expression levels of RFA and its potential correlation with disease severity. Additionally, we conducted in vitro experiments using RFA-inhibiting compounds to assess their effects on cancer cell proliferation and metastasis. Our results revealed a significant upregulation of the RFA complex in advanced-stage colorectal tumors compared to normal tissue, suggesting a potential link between RFA and disease progression. Furthermore, inhibition of RFA led to a decrease in tumor cell viability and migration, highlighting the therapeutic potential of targeting RFA in the treatment of colorectal cancer. These findings provide valuable insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying colorectal cancer and point to RFA as a promising therapeutic target for future drug development.
