prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: CPSase A. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: Recent studies have revealed the crucial role of the carbamoyl phosphate synthetase A (CPSase A) protein complex in the regulation of pyrimidine biosynthesis in the context of cancer. This finding highlights the potential significance of CPSase A as a therapeutic target for cancer treatment. Furthermore, the activation of CPSase A has been implicated in the dysregulation of nucleotide metabolism, leading to aberrant cell proliferation and tumorigenesis. The potential impact of targeting CPSase A in the development of novel anticancer strategies is an exciting area for further investigation. This research elucidates the intricate interplay between CPSase A dysregulation and cancer pathogenesis, providing critical insights that may guide the development of targeted therapies for malignancies associated with nucleotide metabolism abnormalities.
