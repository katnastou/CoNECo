prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: FAR. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The FAR protein complex has been identified as a potential target for therapeutic intervention in cancer. Recent studies have shown that dysregulation of the FAR complex is linked to increased tumor growth and malignancy in various cancer types, including breast cancer and melanoma. Furthermore, inhibition of the FAR complex has demonstrated promising anti-tumor effects in preclinical models. These findings suggest that targeting the FAR complex may represent a novel approach for the treatment of cancer. Further research is warranted to elucidate the precise mechanisms underlying the role of the FAR complex in tumorigenesis and to develop specific inhibitors that can perturb its activity selectively. The therapeutic targeting of the FAR complex holds promise for improving the clinical outcomes of cancer patients.
