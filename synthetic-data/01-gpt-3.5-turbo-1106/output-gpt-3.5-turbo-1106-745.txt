prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: TOM. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The translocase of the outer membrane (TOM) complex is a critical component of the mitochondrial protein import system, facilitating the transport of proteins from the cytosol into the mitochondria. Dysregulation of TOM complex function has been implicated in various mitochondrial diseases, including Parkinson's disease and Leigh syndrome. Recent studies have demonstrated the significant role of TOM complex in maintaining mitochondrial homeostasis and cellular health. Furthermore, small molecule modulators targeting TOM complex have shown promise in preclinical models as potential therapeutic agents for mitochondrial dysfunction-related disorders. Understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying TOM complex function and exploring its potential as a therapeutic target holds great promise for the development of novel interventions to ameliorate mitochondrial diseases.
