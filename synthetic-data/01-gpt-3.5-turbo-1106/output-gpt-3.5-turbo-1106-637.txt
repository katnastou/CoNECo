prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: MalFGK2. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: A recent study investigated the regulatory mechanisms controlling the activity of the MalFGK2 protein complex in the context of bacterial pathogenesis. The research was conducted using a combination of in vitro assays and in vivo experiments in Escherichia coli. The findings revealed a novel interaction between MalFGK2 and a specific small molecule, which resulted in the modulation of its ATPase activity. Furthermore, the study identified a link between the dysregulation of MalFGK2 and the development of antibiotic resistance in E. coli. These results provide valuable insights into the potential role of MalFGK2 in bacterial virulence and antibiotic resistance, highlighting its significance as a potential therapeutic target for combating bacterial infections.
