prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: mitochondrial uniporters. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we investigated the role of mitochondrial uniporters in the context of heart failure. Our findings demonstrate a significant downregulation of mitochondrial uniporter expression in cardiac tissue from patients with heart failure compared to healthy controls. Furthermore, our experimental results in a mouse model of heart failure revealed a correlation between decreased mitochondrial uniporter activity and impaired mitochondrial calcium uptake, leading to disrupted energy metabolism and increased susceptibility to myocardial dysfunction. These findings suggest a potential link between mitochondrial uniporters and the pathogenesis of heart failure, highlighting the importance of further research into the molecular mechanisms underlying mitochondrial dysfunction in cardiac disease.
