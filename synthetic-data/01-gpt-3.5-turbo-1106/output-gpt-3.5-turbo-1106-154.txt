prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: CDL4. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The CDL4 protein complex has been shown to play a crucial role in the progression of colorectal cancer. Previous studies have demonstrated that the overexpression of CDL4 is associated with increased tumor cell proliferation and metastasis in colorectal cancer patients. Additionally, CDL4 expression levels have been linked to the activation of key signaling pathways involved in cancer progression, such as the PI3K/Akt and MAPK pathways. Targeting CDL4 has emerged as a potential therapeutic strategy for colorectal cancer treatment, with small molecule inhibitors showing promising anti-tumor effects in preclinical models. Moreover, recent findings suggest a potential crosstalk between CDL4 and the immune system, highlighting the complex interplay between cancer cells and the tumor microenvironment. Further research into the molecular mechanisms underlying the dysregulation of CDL4 in colorectal cancer is warranted, holding promise for the development of novel targeted therapies for this devastating disease.
