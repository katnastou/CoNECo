prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: Post-translational translocon. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In the present study, we sought to investigate the potential role of the Post-translational translocon in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Utilizing a combination of biochemical assays and mass spectrometry analysis, our results demonstrate a significant dysregulation of the Post-translational translocon in brain tissue samples obtained from AD patients compared to age-matched controls. Furthermore, through functional studies using animal models, we provide evidence that the Post-translational translocon may play a critical role in the processing and trafficking of key amyloidogenic proteins implicated in AD pathogenesis. These findings shed light on the intricate molecular mechanisms underlying AD and present the Post-translational translocon as a potential novel therapeutic target for this devastating neurodegenerative disorder.
