prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: RDRC. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP) complex (RDRC) has emerged as a key player in viral replication and the associated pathogenesis of several viruses. Previous studies have indicated that the dysregulation of RDRC activity can lead to an increased susceptibility to viral infections, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target for antiviral strategies. In the context of respiratory diseases, such as influenza and COVID-19, the RDRC has been implicated in the amplification of viral RNA, leading to exacerbated lung tissue damage and the associated clinical symptoms. Furthermore, the interplay between RDRC and host factors, such as cellular RNA interference pathways, adds another layer of complexity to the understanding of viral replication and pathogenesis. Thus, further investigation into the molecular mechanisms underlying the function of RDRC is warranted to identify potential avenues for the development of antiviral therapies.
