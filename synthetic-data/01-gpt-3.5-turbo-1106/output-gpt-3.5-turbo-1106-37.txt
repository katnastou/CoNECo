prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: centromere specific nucleosome. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The centromere specific nucleosome is a critical component of the centromere, a region of the chromosome essential for proper cell division. Research has shown that disruption of the centromere specific nucleosome can lead to aberrant chromosome segregation and aneuploidy, a condition associated with various developmental disorders and cancer. Recent studies have demonstrated that the centromere specific nucleosome interacts with the centromere protein CENP-A, forming a complex that is involved in maintaining the structural and functional integrity of the centromere. Understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying the assembly and regulation of the centromere specific nucleosome is therefore crucial for elucidating the etiology of diseases associated with centromere dysfunction and for developing potential therapeutic interventions targeting the centromere.
