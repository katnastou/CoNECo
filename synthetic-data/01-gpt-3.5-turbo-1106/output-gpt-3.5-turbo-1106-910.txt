output: The ATP-sensitive potassium (KATP) channel is a key regulator of cellular membrane potential and has been implicated in various physiological and pathological processes. The KATP channel is composed of the inwardly rectifying potassium channel Kir6.1 and the sulfonylurea receptor (SUR). The Kir6.1-SUR complex plays a crucial role in modulating insulin secretion in pancreatic Î²-cells and has been implicated in the pathophysiology of various metabolic diseases, including diabetes mellitus. In recent years, efforts have been directed towards understanding the structural and functional properties of the Kir6.1-SUR complex in order to identify potential targets for therapeutic intervention in KATP channel-related disorders. This research aims to provide novel insights into the pharmacological modulation of the Kir6.1-SUR complex and its implications for the development of targeted treatments for metabolic diseases.
