prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: 4-aminobutyrate transaminase. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The 4-aminobutyrate transaminase (GABA-T) is an essential enzyme involved in the catabolism of the neurotransmitter Î³-aminobutyric acid (GABA) in the central nervous system. Dysregulation of GABA-T activity has been implicated in several neurological disorders, including epilepsy and schizophrenia. Previous studies have shown that GABA-T inhibitors can modulate GABA neurotransmission and have potential therapeutic effects for these disorders. Furthermore, recent research has demonstrated the presence of single nucleotide polymorphisms in the GABA-T gene that are associated with increased susceptibility to certain forms of epilepsy. These findings underscore the importance of further investigations into the functional role and regulation of the 4-aminobutyrate transaminase in neurological diseases.
