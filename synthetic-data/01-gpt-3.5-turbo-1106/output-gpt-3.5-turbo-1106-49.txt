prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: NF-kappaBs. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In recent years, the role of the NF-kappaBs protein complex in the pathogenesis of several inflammatory diseases has gained significant attention. Numerous studies have demonstrated the activation of NF-kappaBs in response to various pro-inflammatory cytokines and pathogen-derived molecules, highlighting its crucial involvement in the regulation of immune and inflammatory responses. Moreover, the dysregulation of NF-kappaBs has been implicated in the progression of conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease, and sepsis. This has led to increased interest in targeting the NF-kappaBs pathway as a potential therapeutic strategy for mitigating chronic inflammatory diseases. Further elucidating the intricate regulatory mechanisms and downstream effectors of NF-kappaBs holds promise for the development of novel treatments aimed at modulating immune and inflammatory processes.
