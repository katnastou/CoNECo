prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: Nop7. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The Nop7 protein complex plays a crucial role in ribosome biogenesis, a key cellular process essential for protein synthesis. Recent studies have shown that disruption of the Nop7 complex leads to impaired ribosome assembly and function, ultimately contributing to the development of ribosomopathies such as Diamond-Blackfan anemia and Shwachman-Diamond syndrome. Furthermore, dysregulation of Nop7 has been implicated in certain cancer types, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target. Given its importance in cellular homeostasis, further investigation into the regulatory mechanisms and interactions of Nop7 is warranted, with the aim of uncovering novel strategies for combating disease states associated with ribosome biogenesis defects.
