prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: AMT1. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The AMT1 protein complex plays a crucial role in the regulation of nitrogen metabolism in plants. Recent studies have implicated AMT1 in the uptake and transport of ammonium ions in various plant species. Additionally, the expression of AMT1 has been shown to be responsive to nitrogen availability in the soil and to play a role in nitrogen use efficiency. Furthermore, mutations in AMT1 have been associated with altered growth and development in Arabidopsis thaliana, suggesting its significance in plant physiology. Understanding the biochemical and physiological functions of AMT1 could offer valuable insights into improving nitrogen uptake and utilization in agricultural crops, with potential implications for addressing global food security and sustainability.
