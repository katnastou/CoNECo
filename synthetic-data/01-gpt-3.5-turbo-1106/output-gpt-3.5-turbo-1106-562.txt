prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: septin. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The septin protein complex has recently emerged as a key player in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases. Accumulating evidence suggests that dysregulation of the septin complex may contribute to the development of Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Furthermore, studies have revealed the involvement of septins in the regulation of cellular processes such as cytokinesis, membrane trafficking, and neuronal morphology. Interestingly, certain small molecules have been identified as potential modulators of septin complex function, offering promising avenues for therapeutic intervention in neurodegenerative disorders. This growing body of research highlights the importance of further investigating the role of the septin complex in disease pathogenesis and its potential as a therapeutic target.
