prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: Biogenesis of Lysosome-related Organelles Complex-2. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The Biogenesis of Lysosome-related Organelles Complex-2 (BLOC-2) is a key regulator of organelle biogenesis and cargo trafficking. Dysfunction of BLOC-2 has been implicated in Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome, a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by oculocutaneous albinism, bleeding diathesis, and pulmonary fibrosis. BLOC-2 functions in concert with other protein complexes and vesicle transport machinery to ensure proper sorting and delivery of lysosomal cargo, including lysosomal enzymes and membrane proteins. Defects in BLOC-2 have been reported to result in abnormal lysosome-related organelle biogenesis and impaired trafficking of melanosomes, leading to skin and eye pigmentation abnormalities in patients. Understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying BLOC-2 function holds important implications for the development of targeted therapies for lysosomal storage disorders and related diseases.
