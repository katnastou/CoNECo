prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: nucleotide-excision repair factor 2. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The nucleotide-excision repair factor 2 (NERF2) is a crucial protein complex that plays a pivotal role in providing defense against DNA damage. Previous studies have shown that NERF2 is involved in the repair of UV-induced DNA lesions, such as thymine dimers and 6-4 photoproducts, which are associated with the development of skin cancers. Furthermore, NERF2 has been implicated in the repair of bulky DNA adducts caused by environmental carcinogens, highlighting its significance in protecting against mutagenic events that could lead to carcinogenesis. Targeting NERF2 may offer potential therapeutic strategies for enhancing DNA repair processes and minimizing the risk of cancer development in individuals exposed to UV radiation and environmental genotoxic agents.
