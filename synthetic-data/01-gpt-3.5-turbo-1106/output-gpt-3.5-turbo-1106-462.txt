prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: type II polyketide synthase. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we investigated the role of the type II polyketide synthase (PKS) complex in the biosynthesis of secondary metabolites in Streptomyces coelicolor. Our results demonstrate that the expression of the PKS complex is upregulated in response to oxidative stress, suggesting its involvement in the cellular response to reactive oxygen species. Furthermore, our analysis revealed that the PKS complex is essential for the production of the antibiotic compound actinorhodin, which has been shown to exhibit potent antibacterial activity against various pathogenic organisms. Our findings shed light on the intricate regulatory network governing PKS complex expression and its crucial role in the biosynthesis of bioactive compounds with potential therapeutic applications.
