prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: KICSTOR. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: Recent studies have implicated the KICSTOR complex in the regulation of autophagy, a crucial cellular process involved in the maintenance of cellular homeostasis and the clearance of damaged organelles and protein aggregates. Dysregulation of autophagy has been associated with various pathologies, including neurodegenerative diseases and cancer. The KICSTOR complex has been found to interact with the mTORC1 complex, a key regulator of cell growth and metabolism, suggesting its involvement in the regulation of cellular nutrient sensing and energy homeostasis. Furthermore, genetic studies in model organisms have demonstrated the essential role of the KICSTOR complex in the control of autophagy and organismal development. Understanding the molecular mechanism of KICSTOR-mediated autophagy regulation may pave the way for the development of novel therapeutic strategies for diseases associated with autophagy dysfunction.
