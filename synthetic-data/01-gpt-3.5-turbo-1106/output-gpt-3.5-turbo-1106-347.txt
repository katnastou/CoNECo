prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: thioglucosidases. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: Thioglucosidases comprise a family of enzymes involved in the metabolism of sulfur-containing compounds in various organisms. Recent research has identified a potential role for thioglucosidases in the pathogenesis of gastrointestinal infections, where their activity is implicated in the breakdown of dietary glucosinolates to release bioactive metabolites. This process has been proposed to influence the composition and function of the gut microbiota, leading to alterations in host-microbe interactions and potentially impacting susceptibility to enteric diseases. Moreover, perturbations in thioglucosidase activity have been associated with dysregulation of sulfur metabolism, highlighting their potential relevance in the context of human disorders such as inflammatory bowel disease and colorectal cancer. These findings underscore the importance of further investigating the functional implications of thioglucosidases in the context of gastrointestinal health and disease.
