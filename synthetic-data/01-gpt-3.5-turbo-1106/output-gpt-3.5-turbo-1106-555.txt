prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: laminin-221. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we investigated the role of laminin-221 in the pathogenesis of muscular dystrophy in mouse models. Our results demonstrate a significant upregulation of laminin-221 expression in the skeletal muscle of mice affected by Duchenne muscular dystrophy, suggesting a potential involvement of the protein complex in disease progression. Furthermore, we observed a correlation between increased laminin-221 levels and the severity of muscle fibrosis and necrosis. Interestingly, treatment with a specific inhibitor of laminin-221 resulted in a reduction of fibrotic tissue and improved muscle function in affected mice. These findings highlight the potential therapeutic implications of targeting laminin-221 in the management of muscular dystrophy. Further studies are warranted to elucidate the mechanisms underlying the involvement of laminin-221 in the pathogenesis of muscular dystrophy and to assess the therapeutic potential of targeting this protein complex in human patients.
