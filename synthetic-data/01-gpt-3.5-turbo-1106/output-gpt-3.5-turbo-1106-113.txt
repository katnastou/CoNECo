prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: laminin-332. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The extracellular matrix (ECM) plays a crucial role in maintaining tissue integrity, and the laminin-332 protein complex is an important component of this network. Deficiency or dysregulation of laminin-332 has been implicated in various pathologies, including Herlitz junctional epidermolysis bullosa, a debilitating skin disorder characterized by blistering and erosions. Studies have shown that aberrant laminin-332 expression in the ECM can lead to abnormal cell adhesion and migration, which may contribute to the pathogenesis of this disease. Understanding the molecular mechanisms governing laminin-332 function and its interactions within the ECM is essential for the development of targeted therapeutic interventions for conditions associated with its dysregulation.
