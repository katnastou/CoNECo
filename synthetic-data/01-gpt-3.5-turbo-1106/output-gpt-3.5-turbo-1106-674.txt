prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: IlvBN. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: A recent study investigated the role of the IlvBN complex in the regulation of branched-chain amino acid biosynthesis in Escherichia coli. The research elucidated the interaction of IlvBN with specific metabolites, highlighting its important role in the maintenance of cellular homeostasis. Furthermore, the study demonstrated the impact of IlvBN dysregulation on the metabolic profile of E. coli, highlighting potential implications for antibiotic resistance and pathogenicity. These findings provide valuable insights into the complex network of metabolic processes in bacteria and emphasize the potential for targeting IlvBN as a novel therapeutic strategy for combating E. coli-associated infections.
