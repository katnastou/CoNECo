prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: collagen type IV trimer. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we investigated the role of the collagen type IV trimer in the pathogenesis of diabetic nephropathy. Using a murine model of diabetes, we demonstrated that the expression level of collagen type IV trimer was significantly increased in the renal tissue of diabetic mice compared to non-diabetic controls. We also observed a positive correlation between the level of collagen type IV trimer and the severity of renal injury, as evidenced by glomerular hypertrophy and proteinuria. Furthermore, inhibition of collagen type IV trimer using a specific antibody attenuated the development of diabetic nephropathy, highlighting the potential of targeting this protein complex as a therapeutic approach for diabetic kidney disease. These findings provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying diabetic nephropathy and suggest collagen type IV trimer as a promising therapeutic target for this devastating complication of diabetes.
