prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: ASTRA. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The association of the ASTRA protein complex with cancer progression has gained significant attention in recent years. Researchers have demonstrated a significant upregulation of ASTRA in various cancer tissues, suggesting a potential role in tumorigenesis. Meanwhile, studies have also revealed a direct correlation between ASTRA expression and poor clinical outcomes in cancer patients. Investigations into the molecular pathways involving ASTRA have uncovered its association with key regulators of cell proliferation and metastasis, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target. Furthermore, recent evidence suggests a link between ASTRA expression and resistance to conventional chemotherapy, warranting further exploration of its role in drug resistance mechanisms. These findings underscore the importance of elucidating the mechanistic underpinnings of ASTRA's involvement in cancer, with potential implications for the development of novel targeted therapies.
