prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase plays a critical role in the regulation of cell growth, proliferation, and survival. Dysregulation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase signaling has been implicated in various human diseases, including cancer, diabetes, and cardiovascular disorders. Targeted inhibitors of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase have emerged as potential therapeutic agents for the treatment of these diseases. The role of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase in intracellular signaling pathways has been extensively studied in various model organisms, and its molecular structure and biochemical properties have been characterized in detail. Understanding the intricate signaling networks involving phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase is crucial for the development of effective therapeutic strategies targeting this pathway.
