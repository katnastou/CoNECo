prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: polyketide synthase. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In recent years, there has been growing interest in the role of the polyketide synthase (PKS) in the biosynthesis of natural products. These complex enzymes are found across a wide range of organisms, including bacteria, fungi, and plants, and are responsible for the production of diverse polyketide compounds. The biogenesis of polyketides has been of particular interest due to their wide array of biological activities, including anticancer, antibiotic, and antifungal properties. Furthermore, elucidating the molecular mechanisms underlying the biosynthesis of these natural products has the potential to inform the development of novel therapeutic agents for the treatment of various human diseases. Despite the significant progress in understanding the structural and functional properties of PKS, there remain many unanswered questions regarding their regulation and potential applications in drug discovery and development. This area of research holds great promise for the future of medicine and biotechnology.
