prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: MlaFEDB. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we investigated the role of the MlaFEDB protein complex in the context of bacterial membrane integrity and lipid homeostasis. Our results demonstrate that the MlaFEDB complex plays a crucial role in the maintenance of bacterial envelope stability and resistance to host immune defenses. Furthermore, we identified a potential small molecule inhibitor that selectively disrupts the function of the MlaFEDB complex, leading to increased bacterial susceptibility to lipid-targeting antibiotics. These findings have significant implications for the development of novel antimicrobial strategies and the potential for therapeutic intervention in the treatment of drug-resistant bacterial infections.
