prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: SufBCDs. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The SufBCDs protein complex has been a subject of intense investigation due to its critical role in the biogenesis of iron-sulfur clusters, which are essential cofactors for a wide range of proteins involved in various cellular processes. Recent studies have implicated SufBCDs in the regulation of cellular iron homeostasis and its potential role in contributing to the pathogenesis of certain neurodegenerative diseases. Furthermore, the interaction of SufBCDs with small molecule inhibitors has garnered attention as a potential therapeutic strategy for conditions associated with iron dysregulation. Continued research into the molecular mechanisms underlying the function of the SufBCDs complex holds promise for the development of novel approaches to combat iron-related disorders.
