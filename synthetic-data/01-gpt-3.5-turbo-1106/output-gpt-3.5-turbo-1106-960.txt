prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: kinesin II. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The role of kinesin II in the transport of intraflagellar proteins has been the subject of considerable interest in the field of ciliopathies. Previous studies have identified a critical interaction between kinesin II and the intraflagellar transport machinery, which is essential for the movement of ciliary components along the axoneme. In this study, we investigated the impact of kinesin II dysregulation on the development of primary cilia in a murine model of Alström syndrome. Our results reveal a significant disruption in ciliary assembly and function in the absence of functional kinesin II, leading to the manifestation of severe phenotypes associated with Alström syndrome. These findings underscore the crucial role of kinesin II in mediating intraflagellar transport and provide important insights into the pathogenesis of ciliopathies.
