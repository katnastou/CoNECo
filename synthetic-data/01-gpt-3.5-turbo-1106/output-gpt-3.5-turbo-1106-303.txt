prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: GDC. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: Recent studies have demonstrated the pivotal role of the GDC protein complex in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease. The GDC complex, comprised of distinct subunits, has been implicated in the regulation of mitochondrial function and oxidative stress response. Dysregulation of GDC has been linked to the accumulation of alpha-synuclein aggregates and the subsequent degeneration of dopaminergic neurons. Importantly, pharmacological intervention targeting the GDC complex has shown promising results in preclinical models, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target for Parkinson's disease. Further investigation into the precise mechanisms underlying the involvement of the GDC complex in disease progression is warranted, with implications for the development of novel treatment strategies for this debilitating neurodegenerative disorder.
