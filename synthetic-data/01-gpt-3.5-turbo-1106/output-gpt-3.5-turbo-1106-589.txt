prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: nuclear pores. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The nuclear pore complex (NPC) is a key structure in eukaryotic cells that facilitates the transport of macromolecules between the nucleus and cytoplasm. Dysregulation of NPC function has been linked to various human diseases, including cancer and neurodegenerative disorders. Recent studies have highlighted the role of nuclear pore proteins in maintaining genomic stability and regulating gene expression. Furthermore, the interaction between specific nuclear pore components and viral proteins has implications for viral infection and pathogenesis. Understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying nuclear pore complex assembly and function is essential for developing targeted therapies for diseases associated with NPC dysfunction. Moreover, investigating the crosstalk between nuclear pores and signaling pathways may provide new insights into cellular homeostasis and disease pathogenesis.
