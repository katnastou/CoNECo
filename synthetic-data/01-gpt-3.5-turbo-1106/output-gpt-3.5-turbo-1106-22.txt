prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: MRN. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The MRN complex, comprised of Mre11, Rad50, and Nbs1, plays a critical role in the recognition and signaling of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs). In this study, we investigated the impact of chemical inhibitors on the activation of MRN in response to DSBs induced by ionizing radiation. Our findings demonstrated that the exposure of mammalian cells to specific inhibitors led to the suppression of MRN complex activation, resulting in faulty DNA repair and increased genomic instability. Furthermore, we observed an elevated incidence of radiation-induced mutations and chromosomal abnormalities in cells lacking functional MRN. These results suggest that the MRN complex is an essential mediator of DSB repair and underscores the potential importance of targeting MRN for the development of novel therapies for diseases associated with defective DNA repair mechanisms.
