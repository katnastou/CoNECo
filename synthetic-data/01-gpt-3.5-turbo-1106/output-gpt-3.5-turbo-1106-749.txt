prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: alkyl hydroperoxide reductase. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In recent years, the alkyl hydroperoxide reductase (AhpC) protein complex has garnered significant attention for its crucial role in cellular defense against oxidative stress. Studies have indicated its involvement in the detoxification of peroxides and protection against reactive oxygen species. Ongoing investigations have revealed potential implications of AhpC in various pathological conditions, including neurodegenerative diseases and certain cancers. Additionally, the association of AhpC with the pathogenesis of infectious diseases has raised compelling interest in exploring its potential as a therapeutic target. Despite progress in understanding the functional significance of AhpC, substantial gaps in our knowledge of its regulatory mechanisms and interplay with cellular pathways remain. Elucidating these aspects holds promise for advancing not only the understanding of AhpC's biological relevance but also for developing strategies to exploit its potential in the management of oxidative stress-related disorders.
