prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: translation release factor. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: Our study investigated the role of the translation release factor (TRF) in cellular stress response in yeast cells. We found that exposure to oxidative stress led to a significant upregulation of TRF activity, indicating its involvement in the cell's defense against oxidative damage. Furthermore, we observed that the deletion of TRF gene resulted in increased sensitivity to oxidative stress, suggesting its essential role in the survival of yeast cells under such conditions. Our findings provide valuable insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying cellular responses to oxidative stress, with potential implications for understanding and treating oxidative stress-related diseases in humans.
