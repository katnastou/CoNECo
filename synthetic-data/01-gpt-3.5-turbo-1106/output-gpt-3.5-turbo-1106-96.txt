prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: exon-exon junctions. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The role of exon-exon junctions in RNA splicing and its potential implications in neurological disorders have garnered considerable attention in recent research. The identification of specific small molecule modulators targeting exon-exon junctions may offer new avenues for therapeutic interventions in conditions characterized by aberrant RNA processing, such as spinal muscular atrophy and myotonic dystrophy. Additionally, elucidating the molecular mechanisms underlying the recognition and processing of exon-exon junctions by the spliceosome holds promise for advancing our understanding of RNA biology and may open up new possibilities for therapeutic development. These findings suggest a novel approach to addressing the pathogenic mechanisms of certain neurological diseases, and the potential therapeutic implications of targeting exon-exon junctions warrant further investigation.
