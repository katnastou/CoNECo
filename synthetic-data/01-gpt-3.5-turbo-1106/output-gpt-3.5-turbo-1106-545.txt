prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: type III restriction enzyme. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we investigated the impact of methylated DNA sequences on the activity of the type III restriction enzyme in the context of bacterial DNA repair mechanisms. Our findings demonstrate a significant reduction in the enzymatic activity of the type III restriction enzyme in the presence of highly methylated DNA sequences, particularly those associated with pathogenic bacterial strains. These results suggest a potential mechanism by which bacterial pathogens may evade host immune responses and contribute to the development of antibiotic resistance. Further elucidation of the interplay between DNA methylation and type III restriction enzyme activity may provide insights into novel therapeutic strategies for combating bacterial infections.
