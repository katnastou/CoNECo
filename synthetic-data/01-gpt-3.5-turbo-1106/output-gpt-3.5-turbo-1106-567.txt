prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: CPSF. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The role of the Cleavage and Polyadenylation Specificity Factor (CPSF) complex in mRNA processing has long been of interest due to its critical involvement in cellular gene expression. Recent studies have elucidated the interplay between CPSF and various regulatory factors, highlighting its significance in controlling the dynamics of mRNA maturation. Remarkably, the interaction between CPSF and specific RNA binding proteins has been shown to modulate the cleavage and polyadenylation of mRNA transcripts in response to cellular stresses, suggesting a potential role in the regulation of gene expression under physiological and pathological conditions. Furthermore, dysregulation of CPSF function has been implicated in several human diseases, including cancer and neurodegenerative disorders, underscoring the clinical importance of understanding the intricate mechanisms governing CPSF-mediated mRNA processing. This growing body of evidence underscores the potential therapeutic relevance of targeting CPSF in the treatment of various disease states.
