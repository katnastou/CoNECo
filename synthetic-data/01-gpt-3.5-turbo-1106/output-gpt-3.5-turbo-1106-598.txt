prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: kinesin Is. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In recent studies, the role of the kinesin Is protein complex in the progression of neurodegenerative diseases has gained increasing attention. The interaction between kinesin Is and alpha-synuclein has been implicated in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease, with evidence suggesting that aberrant regulation of this complex may contribute to the accumulation of toxic alpha-synuclein aggregates. Additionally, small molecule inhibitors targeting kinesin Is have shown promise in preclinical models for the treatment of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, further highlighting the potential impact of this protein complex in neurodegenerative disorders. These findings underscore the need for further investigation into the molecular mechanisms underlying the involvement of kinesin Is in these diseases and the development of novel therapeutic strategies targeting this complex.
