prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: ABC lipid flippase MsbA. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we aimed to investigate the role of the ABC lipid flippase MsbA in the development of atherosclerosis in mice. The MsbA protein complex is known to play a crucial role in the transport of lipids across cellular membranes. Atherosclerosis, characterized by the buildup of plaque in arterial walls, is a major risk factor for cardiovascular disease. In our experiments, we utilized a mouse model with targeted disruption of the MsbA gene to assess the impact of loss of function of the ABC lipid flippase MsbA on atherosclerotic lesion development. Our results indicate that mice lacking functional MsbA exhibited accelerated progression of atherosclerosis compared to wild-type controls, suggesting a protective role for the ABC lipid flippase MsbA in the context of cardiovascular disease. This finding highlights the potential significance of targeting the MsbA complex for the development of novel therapeutic strategies for atherosclerosis and related cardiovascular complications.
