prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: Haemonchus galactose-containing glycoprotein. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we aimed to elucidate the immunomodulatory effects of the Haemonchus galactose-containing glycoprotein (H-gal-GP) on host immune responses in the context of parasite infection. To investigate the impact of H-gal-GP on immune cells, we conducted in vitro co-culture experiments using peripheral blood mononuclear cells derived from healthy human subjects. Our results demonstrated that exposure to H-gal-GP led to a significant increase in the production of interleukin-10 (IL-10) and transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β), while also suppressing the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) and interferon-gamma (IFN-γ). Furthermore, we observed a shift in the polarization of CD4+ T cells towards a regulatory T cell phenotype, characterized by elevated expression of FoxP3 and CTLA-4. These findings provide valuable insights into the mechanistic underpinnings of H-gal-GP-mediated immunomodulation, shedding light on its potential as a therapeutic target in the context of helminth infections and related immune-mediated disorders.
