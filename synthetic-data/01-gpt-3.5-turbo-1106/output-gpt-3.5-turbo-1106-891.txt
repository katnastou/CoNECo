prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: methionine importers. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we investigate the role of methionine importers in the progression of oxidative stress-induced neurodegeneration in a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease. We demonstrate that the upregulation of methionine importers is associated with increased methionine uptake in the brain, leading to heightened levels of homocysteine and S-adenosylmethionine. Furthermore, we show that inhibition of methionine importers results in decreased homocysteine accumulation and attenuates neurodegenerative pathology. Our findings suggest that targeting methionine importers may be a promising therapeutic strategy for ameliorating cognitive impairment and neurodegeneration in Alzheimer's disease.
