prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: Phosphate ABC transporters. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The Phosphate ABC transporters play a crucial role in the transportation of phosphate ions across cellular membranes in various organisms. Dysregulation of these transporters has been associated with phosphate homeostasis disorders such as hypophosphatemia, leading to skeletal and muscular abnormalities. Inorganic phosphate is indispensable for cellular metabolism and energy production, as well as for structural integrity of bones and teeth in humans. Furthermore, phosphate signaling pathways have been implicated in the pathogenesis of several human diseases, including cancer and vascular calcification. Understanding the mechanisms underlying the regulation and function of Phosphate ABC transporters is essential for developing targeted therapeutic interventions for diseases related to phosphate metabolism.
