prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: polycystin. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The role of the polycystin protein complex in the pathogenesis of polycystic kidney disease (PKD) remains an area of active investigation. Mutations in the polycystin gene have been implicated in the development of PKD, a common genetic disorder characterized by the formation of fluid-filled cysts in the kidneys, leading to impaired kidney function and eventual renal failure. Recent studies have also suggested a potential link between polycystin and calcium signaling pathways, highlighting its involvement in cellular processes beyond cyst formation. Additionally, the interplay between polycystin and other signaling molecules such as cAMP and mTOR signaling pathways has been proposed to contribute to the dysregulated growth and proliferation observed in PKD. Further elucidation of the molecular mechanisms underlying polycystin function may offer valuable insights into the development of targeted therapies for PKD.
