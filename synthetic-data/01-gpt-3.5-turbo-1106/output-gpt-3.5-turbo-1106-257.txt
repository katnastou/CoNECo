prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: GPI-MT-I. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In recent years, the role of the GPI-MT-I protein complex in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease has garnered significant attention. The complex is thought to be involved in the regulation of amyloid-beta aggregation, a key hallmark of the disease. In studies utilizing transgenic mouse models, the disruption of GPI-MT-I function has been shown to exacerbate cognitive deficits and accelerate the formation of amyloid plaques in the brain. Furthermore, small molecule inhibitors targeting the activity of GPI-MT-I have demonstrated promising results in preclinical studies, showcasing their potential as therapeutic agents for Alzheimer's disease. These findings highlight the importance of further investigating the molecular mechanisms underlying the function of the GPI-MT-I complex, and the potential of targeted interventions for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease.
