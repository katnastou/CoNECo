prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: Thyrotropin. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: Thyrotropin, a glycoprotein hormone secreted by the anterior pituitary gland, plays a crucial role in the regulation of thyroid function through activation of the thyrotropin receptor. Dysregulation of thyrotropin levels is associated with several thyroid disorders, including hyperthyroidism and hypothyroidism. Recent studies have identified potential therapeutic targets involved in the modulation of thyrotropin signaling pathways, offering new avenues for the development of treatments for thyroid-related diseases. Furthermore, the relationship between thyrotropin and thyroid cancer has also drawn attention, with investigations into the potential impact of thyrotropin on tumor growth and progression. Understanding the intricate interplay between thyrotropin and thyroid function may reveal novel insights into the pathophysiology of thyroid disorders and pave the way for the development of targeted therapies.
