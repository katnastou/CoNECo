prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: G protein-coupled GABA receptor. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The G protein-coupled GABA receptor is a critical mediator of inhibitory neurotransmission in the central nervous system, playing a pivotal role in regulating neuronal excitability and synaptic transmission. Dysregulation of the G protein-coupled GABA receptor has been implicated in various neurological disorders, including epilepsy, anxiety, and schizophrenia. Recent studies have investigated the allosteric modulators of this receptor complex as potential therapeutic agents for the treatment of these conditions. Additionally, the development of selective ligands for the G protein-coupled GABA receptor has garnered interest as a promising strategy to modulate its activity and function in a targeted manner. Understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying the signaling pathways of this receptor complex will provide valuable insights for elucidating its physiological and pathological roles in the brain.
