prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: Polycomb repressive deubiquitinase. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The Polycomb repressive deubiquitinase (PR-DUB) complex has garnered significant scientific interest for its role in epigenetic regulation and its potential implications in cancer biology. Recent studies have shown that PR-DUB is involved in the deubiquitination of histone H2A, leading to the maintenance of repressed chromatin states and the regulation of gene expression. Dysregulation of PR-DUB has been implicated in several malignancies, including prostate cancer and breast cancer, suggesting a potential therapeutic target for these diseases. Furthermore, the intricate interplay between PR-DUB and other chromatin modifiers such as polycomb repressive complex 1 (PRC1) highlights the complexity of epigenetic regulation and warrants further investigation into the molecular mechanisms underlying PR-DUB function.
