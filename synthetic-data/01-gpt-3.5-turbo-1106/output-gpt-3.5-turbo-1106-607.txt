prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: WASP and Scar homologue. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The assembly and regulation of the actin cytoskeleton are essential processes in various cellular functions, and the WASP and Scar homologue (WASH) protein complex plays a crucial role in these activities. Recent studies have demonstrated that the WASH complex is involved in the regulation of endosomal trafficking and plays a significant role in maintaining cellular homeostasis. Dysregulation of the WASH complex has been implicated in a variety of human diseases, such as neurodegenerative disorders, cancer, and infectious diseases. Understanding the intricate mechanisms governing the WASH complex and its interactions with other cellular machinery could offer critical insights into disease pathogenesis and may also present potential therapeutic targets for intervention.
