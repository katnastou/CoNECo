prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: inner centromere core. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The inner centromere core is a key component in the regulation of chromosome segregation during mitosis. Its role in maintaining the integrity of the centromere and ensuring proper kinetochore assembly has been well documented in various eukaryotic organisms. Recent studies have implicated the inner centromere core in the pathogenesis of certain genetic disorders, including chromosomal instability syndromes and neoplastic diseases. Furthermore, dysregulation of the inner centromere core has been associated with aberrant cell division and aneuploidy, providing insight into its potential therapeutic targets for cancer treatment. The elucidation of the molecular mechanisms underlying the function of the inner centromere core holds promise for developing novel interventions aimed at mitigating chromosomal instability-related diseases.
