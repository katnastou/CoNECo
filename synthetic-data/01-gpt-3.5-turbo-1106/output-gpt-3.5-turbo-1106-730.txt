prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: high-density lipoprotein particle. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The high-density lipoprotein particle (HDL) is a key player in the regulation of cholesterol metabolism and its association with cardiovascular diseases. In this study, we aimed to investigate the impact of dietary polyunsaturated fatty acids on the dynamics of HDL in a mouse model of atherosclerosis. We observed a significant increase in the concentration of HDL in the plasma of mice receiving a high-polyunsaturated fatty acid diet compared to those on a control diet. Furthermore, we found that the increased HDL levels were associated with a reduction in atherosclerotic plaque formation in the aorta of the treated mice. Our findings suggest that dietary polyunsaturated fatty acids may modulate HDL metabolism and contribute to the prevention of atherosclerosis, highlighting the potential therapeutic implications for managing cardiovascular diseases.
