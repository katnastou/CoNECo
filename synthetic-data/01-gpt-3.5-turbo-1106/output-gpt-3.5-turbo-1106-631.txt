prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: DNMT3B–3L. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The role of the DNMT3B–3L protein complex in the pathogenesis of colorectal cancer is a topic of great interest in current biomedical research. A recent study conducted on a cohort of colorectal cancer patients demonstrated a significant upregulation of the DNMT3B–3L complex in tumor tissues compared to adjacent healthy tissue. Importantly, the study also revealed a positive correlation between the expression levels of DNMT3B–3L and the presence of metastases. Furthermore, in vitro experiments using colorectal cancer cell lines showed that inhibition of DNMT3B–3L expression led to a decrease in tumor cell proliferation and increased susceptibility to chemotherapeutic agents. These findings underscore the potential of targeting the DNMT3B–3L complex as a therapeutic strategy for colorectal cancer and provide potential insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying tumor progression and metastasis.
