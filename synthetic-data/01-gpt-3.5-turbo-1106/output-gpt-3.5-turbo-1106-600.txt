prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: eukaryotic translation elongation factor 1. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The eukaryotic translation elongation factor 1 (eEF1) plays a critical role in protein synthesis in eukaryotic organisms. Recent studies have highlighted the interaction between eEF1 and ribosomal proteins in the context of cancer biology. Interestingly, dysregulation of eEF1 has been implicated in the pathogenesis of certain hematologic malignancies such as acute myeloid leukemia. Furthermore, small molecule modulators targeting eEF1 have shown promise as potential therapeutic agents in preclinical models of cancer. These findings shed light on the multifaceted role of eEF1 in disease pathogenesis and provide a foundation for further exploration of its potential as a target for cancer therapy.
