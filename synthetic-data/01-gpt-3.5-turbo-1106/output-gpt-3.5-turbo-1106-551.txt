prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: RNA polymerase II, core. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we investigated the role of the RNA polymerase II, core complex in the regulation of gene expression in human cells. We identified a novel small molecule inhibitor that specifically targets the RNA polymerase II, core complex, and demonstrated its efficacy in reducing the transcription of key oncogenes associated with breast cancer. Furthermore, we observed a significant decrease in the proliferation of breast cancer cells upon treatment with the inhibitor, suggesting its potential therapeutic application in the context of breast cancer. Our findings provide valuable insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying cancer progression and highlight the RNA polymerase II, core complex as a promising target for the development of novel anti-cancer agents.
