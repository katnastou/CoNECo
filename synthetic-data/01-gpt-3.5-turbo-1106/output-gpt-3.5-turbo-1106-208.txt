prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: PeBoW. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we investigated the role of the PeBoW protein complex in the progression of neurodegenerative diseases. Utilizing a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease, we observed a significant downregulation of PeBoW expression in the hippocampus, a brain region crucial for memory and learning. Interestingly, our analysis revealed that PeBoW interacts with key signaling pathways involved in synaptic function and neuroprotection. Furthermore, we identified potential small molecule modulators of PeBoW activity, demonstrating their ability to rescue cognitive deficits in the mouse model. These findings provide compelling evidence for the involvement of the PeBoW protein complex in neurodegenerative diseases and highlight its potential as a therapeutic target for Alzheimer's disease and related disorders.
