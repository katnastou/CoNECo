prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: preribosomes. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we investigated the functional role of the preribosomes in the development of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Using a series of in vitro assays and NSCLC cell line models, we observed a significant upregulation of preribosome activity in cancerous tissue compared to healthy controls. Furthermore, we identified a correlation between high preribosome expression and poor patient survival outcomes. Mechanistically, we found that the dysregulation of preribosome function led to enhanced ribosome biogenesis and increased protein synthesis in cancer cells, contributing to their aggressive phenotype. These findings provide valuable insights into the potential therapeutic targeting of preribosomes in NSCLC treatment.
