prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: Histidine ABC transporter. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we investigated the role of the Histidine ABC transporter in the pathogenesis of Wilson’s disease, a rare genetic disorder characterized by impaired copper metabolism. By employing a combination of biochemical assays and high-resolution imaging techniques, we demonstrated that the activity of the Histidine ABC transporter is significantly dysregulated in hepatic tissues of individuals with Wilson’s disease. Furthermore, analysis of a murine model of the disease revealed an aberrant localization pattern of the transporter within hepatocytes, suggesting a potential link between Histidine ABC transporter dysfunction and the pathological accumulation of copper in the liver. These findings underscore the importance of understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying copper homeostasis and offer new insights into the potential therapeutic interventions for Wilson’s disease.
