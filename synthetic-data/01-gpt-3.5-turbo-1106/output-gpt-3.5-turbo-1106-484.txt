prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: MACIT. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The membrane attack complex inhibitory protein (MACIT) has emerged as a key factor in the regulation of complement activation, which is a crucial component of the innate immune response. MACIT has been shown to modulate the formation and stability of the membrane attack complex (MAC), a multi-subunit protein complex that plays a central role in the elimination of pathogens and host cells. Dysregulation of MACIT has been implicated in various immune-mediated diseases, including autoimmune disorders and inflammatory conditions. Recent studies have highlighted the potential of targeting MACIT in the development of therapeutic strategies for managing complement-related disorders. Further elucidation of the mechanisms underlying MACIT function and its interactions with other complement regulatory proteins may provide valuable insights for the development of novel treatment approaches.
