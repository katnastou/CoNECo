prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: IML1. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we investigated the role of the IML1 protein complex in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease. Using a combination of biochemical assays and genetic manipulation in Caenorhabditis elegans, we found that disruption of IML1 function resulted in severe mitochondrial dysfunction, leading to increased oxidative stress and neurodegeneration in the nematodes. Through pharmacological interventions using auranofin, a potential modulator of IML1 activity, we were able to mitigate the neurodegenerative phenotypes observed in the nematodes. Our findings provide insights into the critical role of the IML1 protein complex in maintaining mitochondrial function and suggest potential therapeutic targets for Parkinson's disease.
