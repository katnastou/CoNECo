prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: centromeric nucleosomes. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: Centromeric nucleosomes are crucial components of the eukaryotic kinetochore, playing a central role in mediating chromosome segregation during cell division. The structural integrity and functional dynamics of centromeric nucleosomes are governed by a complex interplay of post-translational modifications, histone variants, and associated non-histone proteins. Recent studies have elucidated the importance of chromatin remodeling factors in maintaining the assembly and stability of centromeric nucleosomes. Dysregulation of centromeric nucleosome composition and organization has been implicated in various conditions, including aneuploidy and cancer. Further investigation into the molecular mechanisms governing centromeric nucleosome assembly and function is warranted to gain a comprehensive understanding of their roles in health and disease.
