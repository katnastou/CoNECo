prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: tRNA methyltransferases. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The tRNA methyltransferases protein complex is a critical component of the cellular machinery responsible for modifying tRNAs by adding methyl groups to specific nucleotides. This modification is essential for proper tRNA function and is important for regulating translation fidelity and efficiency. Dysregulation of tRNA methyltransferases has been associated with various diseases, including cancer and neurological disorders. Understanding the structure and function of this protein complex is crucial for developing targeted therapies to modulate tRNA modifications and potentially alleviate disease pathologies. Moreover, investigating the interactions between tRNA methyltransferases and other cellular components can provide valuable insights into the broader network of molecular processes underlying health and disease.
