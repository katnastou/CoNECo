prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: multisubunit RNA polymerases. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The regulation of gene expression is a complex process essential for the proper functioning of cells. Recent studies have shown that multisubunit RNA polymerases play a critical role in transcription initiation, elongation, and termination. Dysregulation of these polymerases has been implicated in various human diseases, including cancer and neurological disorders. The activity of multisubunit RNA polymerases is tightly controlled by a network of transcription factors and epigenetic modifications. Understanding the intricate mechanisms governing the function of these protein complexes is crucial for developing targeted therapies to modulate gene expression in disease states. Further investigation into the role of multisubunit RNA polymerases in disease pathology may provide valuable insights for the development of novel therapeutic interventions.
