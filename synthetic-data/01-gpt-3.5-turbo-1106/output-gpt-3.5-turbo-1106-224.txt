prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: IFT complex As. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: Intraflagellar transport (IFT) is an essential cellular process involved in the assembly and maintenance of cilia, which are critical for various sensory and signaling functions in eukaryotic organisms. The IFT complex As, a component of the larger IFT complex, has been implicated in the pathogenesis of ciliopathies such as Bardet-Biedl syndrome and Joubert syndrome. Dysregulation of IFT complex As has been associated with impaired ciliary trafficking and aberrant signaling cascades, leading to disrupted cellular homeostasis and disease phenotypes. Understanding the molecular mechanisms governing the function of IFT complex As holds promise for the development of targeted therapeutic interventions for ciliopathies and related disorders.
