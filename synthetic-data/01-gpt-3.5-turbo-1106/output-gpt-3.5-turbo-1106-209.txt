prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: Cis-IPTases. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we investigated the role of Cis-IPTases in the progression of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Using a murine model, we observed a significant upregulation of Cis-IPTases expression in lung tissue following exposure to cigarette smoke, a major risk factor for COPD development. Moreover, we found that inhibition of Cis-IPTases activity using a selective small molecule inhibitor led to a reduction in lung inflammation and improved pulmonary function in the COPD mice. Our findings suggest that targeting Cis-IPTases may represent a potential therapeutic strategy for mitigating the pathogenesis of COPD and alleviating its associated respiratory complications.
