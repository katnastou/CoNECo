prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: N-terminal acetyltransferase A. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we investigated the role of the N-terminal acetyltransferase A (NatA) protein complex in the progression of colorectal cancer. Our findings revealed a significant upregulation of NatA expression in tumor tissues compared to normal adjacent tissues. Further analysis demonstrated a correlation between high NatA expression levels and advanced tumor stage, lymph node metastasis, and poor patient prognosis. Additionally, functional studies using NatA knockdown models in colorectal cancer cell lines showed a significant suppression of cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. These results suggest a potential oncogenic role for NatA in colorectal cancer progression, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target for this disease.
