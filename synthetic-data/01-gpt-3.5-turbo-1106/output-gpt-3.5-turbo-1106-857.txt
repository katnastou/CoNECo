prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: SSU processome. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The SSU processome is a large ribonucleoprotein complex essential for the maturation of pre-ribosomal RNA in eukaryotic cells. Recent studies have identified the role of the SSU processome in ribosome biogenesis, where it coordinates various assembly steps and ensures the correct folding and modification of the pre-rRNA. Mutations in genes encoding SSU processome components have been implicated in ribosomopathies, a group of inherited disorders characterized by defects in ribosome function. Furthermore, dysregulation of the SSU processome has been observed in various cancers, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target. Understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying SSU processome function and regulation may provide insights into ribosome-related diseases and open avenues for targeted therapies.
