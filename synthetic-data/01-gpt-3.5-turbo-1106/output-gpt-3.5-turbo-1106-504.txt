prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: centriolar distal appendages. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: Investigating the role of centriolar distal appendages in ciliopathies, a leading cause of inherited disorders, remains a critical area of research. Emerging evidence suggests that defects in these appendages contribute to the pathogenesis of ciliopathies, such as Bardet-Biedl syndrome and Joubert syndrome. The identification of small molecules targeting the regulatory pathways associated with centriolar distal appendages may offer promising therapeutic approaches for these debilitating conditions. Furthermore, a deeper understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying the assembly and function of centriolar distal appendages could lead to the development of novel diagnostic and prognostic markers for ciliopathies and pave the way for innovative treatment strategies. The intricate interplay between centriolar distal appendages and ciliopathy progression underscores the importance of unraveling these molecular events to improve clinical outcomes for affected individuals.
