prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: calpains. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In the complex network of cellular signaling pathways, calpains play a critical role in various physiological processes, including cell proliferation, cytoskeletal remodeling, and apoptosis. Dysregulation of calpains has been implicated in several pathological conditions, such as neurodegenerative disorders, muscular dystrophy, and cancer. The involvement of calpains in these diverse diseases underscores their importance as potential therapeutic targets. Despite the growing interest in calpains, much remains to be elucidated regarding their precise regulatory mechanisms and their interplay with other cellular components. Further investigation into the role of calpains in disease pathogenesis holds promise for the development of novel interventions aimed at modulating their activity and restoring cellular homeostasis.
