prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: IgM immunoglobulin. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The IgM immunoglobulin plays a crucial role in the humoral immune response and is pivotal in the defense against microbial pathogens and foreign substances. Various pathological conditions, such as autoimmune diseases and infections, have been linked to dysregulation of IgM immunoglobulin levels. Recent studies have shown that aberrant IgM immunoglobulin expression is associated with autoimmune hemolytic anemia and systemic lupus erythematosus. Additionally, the level of IgM immunoglobulin has been found to correlate with disease severity in patients with hepatitis B virus infection. These findings highlight the significance of IgM immunoglobulin in maintaining immune homeostasis and its potential as a diagnostic and therapeutic target in autoimmune and infectious diseases.
