prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: Succinic dehydrogenases. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we investigated the role of Succinic dehydrogenases in the pathogenesis of mitochondrial disorders. Our findings revealed a significant upregulation of Succinic dehydrogenases in muscle tissue samples from patients with mitochondrial encephalomyopathy. Moreover, we observed a positive correlation between Succinic dehydrogenases levels and the severity of respiratory chain deficiencies in these patients. Additionally, we found that Succinic dehydrogenases activity was markedly reduced in the presence of high levels of reactive oxygen species, which are known to contribute to mitochondrial dysfunction. These findings provide important insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying mitochondrial disorders and may uncover potential therapeutic targets for the management of these debilitating diseases.
