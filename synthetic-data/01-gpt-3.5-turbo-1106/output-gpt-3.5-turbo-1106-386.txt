prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: SNAREs. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: Intracellular membrane fusion is a crucial event in various cellular processes, including neurotransmitter release at synaptic terminals. The SNAREs (soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptors) are a key protein complex involved in this highly regulated process. SNAREs are integral to the fusion of synaptic vesicles with the plasma membrane, leading to neurotransmitter release. Dysregulation of SNARE complex function has been implicated in several neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's. Understanding the intricate mechanisms of SNARE-mediated membrane fusion is critical for developing novel therapeutic approaches to modulate neurotransmitter release and treat neurological disorders.
