prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: membrane-bound IgG2b. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The membrane-bound IgG2b protein complex has been implicated in the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis. Previous studies have shown that the expression levels of membrane-bound IgG2b are elevated in the synovial tissues of rheumatoid arthritis patients compared to healthy individuals. Furthermore, it has been demonstrated that the presence of membrane-bound IgG2b is associated with increased inflammation and joint destruction in animal models of rheumatoid arthritis. These findings highlight the potential of membrane-bound IgG2b as a therapeutic target for the treatment of autoimmune diseases and underscore the importance of further investigation into the role of this protein complex in disease pathogenesis.
