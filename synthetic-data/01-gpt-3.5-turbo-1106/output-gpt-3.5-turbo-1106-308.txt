model: gpt-3.5-turbo-1106
prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: UTP-As. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The UTP-As protein complex plays a crucial role in ribosomal RNA processing and ribosome biogenesis in eukaryotic cells. Recent studies have demonstrated the involvement of UTP-As in the formation of the small subunit (SSU) processome, a pre-ribosomal subcomplex essential for early pre-rRNA processing. Furthermore, UTP-As has been implicated in cellular growth and proliferation, suggesting its potential relevance in cancer biology. Dysfunction of UTP-As has been linked to developmental disorders and ribosomopathies, highlighting the importance of understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying its function. Further investigation of UTP-As and its interacting partners may offer insights into novel therapeutic targets for diseases associated with aberrant ribosome biogenesis.
