prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: IL-12 receptor. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The IL-12 receptor is a crucial component of the immune system, playing a key role in the pathogenesis of various autoimmune diseases, infectious diseases, and cancer. This protein complex consists of two subunits, IL-12Rβ1 and IL-12Rβ2, which upon activation, initiate a signaling cascade leading to the production of interferon-γ and activation of natural killer cells and T cells. Dysregulation of the IL-12 receptor has been implicated in the development of inflammatory bowel disease, multiple sclerosis, and rheumatoid arthritis. Additionally, targeting the IL-12 receptor has emerged as a promising therapeutic strategy for treating these diseases as well as certain types of cancer. Understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying IL-12 receptor signaling is therefore crucial for the development of novel targeted therapies to modulate immune responses in these various disease conditions.
