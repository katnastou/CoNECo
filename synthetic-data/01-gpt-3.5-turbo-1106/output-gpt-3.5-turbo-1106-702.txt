prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: VLA-5. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we investigated the role of the VLA-5 protein complex in the pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis. Through a series of experiments utilizing samples from patients with rheumatoid arthritis and healthy controls, we observed that the expression level of VLA-5 was significantly elevated in diseased synovial tissues compared to healthy controls. Furthermore, inhibition of VLA-5 using a specific small molecule inhibitor resulted in a significant reduction in synovial inflammation and joint destruction in a mouse model of rheumatoid arthritis. Our findings suggest that VLA-5 plays a crucial role in the progression of rheumatoid arthritis and may represent a potential therapeutic target for this debilitating disease.
