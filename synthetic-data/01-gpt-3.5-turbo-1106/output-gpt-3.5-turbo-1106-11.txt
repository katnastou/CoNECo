prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: mitochondrial fatty acid beta-oxidation multienzyme. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: Mitochondrial fatty acid beta-oxidation multienzyme is a crucial complex involved in the catabolism of long-chain fatty acids, which generates acetyl-CoA and subsequently enters the citric acid cycle to produce ATP. Dysfunction of the mitochondrial fatty acid beta-oxidation multienzyme has been associated with various metabolic disorders, including but not limited to mitochondrial myopathies, cardiomyopathies, and hepatic encephalopathy. Studies have implicated the role of this multienzyme complex in the pathogenesis of certain inherited metabolic diseases, such as medium-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency. Understanding the molecular mechanisms governing the activity and regulation of the mitochondrial fatty acid beta-oxidation multienzyme complex is crucial for the development of targeted therapeutic interventions aimed at mitigating the adverse effects associated with impaired fatty acid metabolism.
