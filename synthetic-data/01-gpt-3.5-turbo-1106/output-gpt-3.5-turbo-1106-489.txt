prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: enolases. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: Enolases are a conserved family of enzymes that play a critical role in glycolysis and gluconeogenesis, the metabolic pathways responsible for energy production and glucose metabolism in diverse organisms, including humans. Recent studies have indicated a potential association between enolases and certain neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease. Furthermore, enolases have been found to be involved in the regulation of immune cell function and have been implicated in the pathogenesis of autoimmune disorders. Elucidating the diverse functions and regulatory mechanisms of enolases may provide valuable insights into potential therapeutic targets for a range of diseases, making them a promising subject for further investigation in biomedical research.
