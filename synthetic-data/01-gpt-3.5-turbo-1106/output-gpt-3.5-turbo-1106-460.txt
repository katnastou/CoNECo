prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: mannosyl-oligosaccharide 1,2-alpha-mannosidase. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we investigated the involvement of the mannosyl-oligosaccharide 1,2-alpha-mannosidase in the pathogenesis of congenital disorders of glycosylation, a group of metabolic disorders characterized by defects in the glycosylation of proteins and lipids. Using a transgenic mouse model, we demonstrated that the deficiency of this enzyme led to disturbances in the glycosylation pattern of critical proteins involved in cellular processes, ultimately resulting in severe developmental abnormalities and early mortality. Furthermore, we identified potential therapeutic compounds that could restore the proper function of the mannosyl-oligosaccharide 1,2-alpha-mannosidase and ameliorate the phenotypic consequences of its deficiency. Our findings highlight the essential role of this glycosidase in normal development and provide insights into potential treatment strategies for congenital disorders of glycosylation.
