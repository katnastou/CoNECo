prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: Import inner membrane translocases. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In recent studies, the role of Import inner membrane translocases (IMT) in mitochondrial dysfunction associated with neurodegenerative diseases has garnered significant attention. Investigations using IMT-deficient animal models have revealed notable disruptions in the import of mitochondrial proteins, leading to impaired mitochondrial homeostasis and energy metabolism. Furthermore, dysregulation of IMT has been implicated in the pathogenesis of various neurodegenerative disorders, including Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease. These findings highlight the critical involvement of IMT in the maintenance of mitochondrial function and suggest potential therapeutic targets for mitigating neurodegenerative pathology through the modulation of IMT activity.
