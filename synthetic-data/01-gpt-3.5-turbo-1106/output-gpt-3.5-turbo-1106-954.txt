prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: IgG B cell receptors. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we investigated the role of IgG B cell receptors in the pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis. Our results demonstrated a significant increase in the expression of IgG B cell receptors in the synovial tissues of rheumatoid arthritis patients compared to healthy controls. Furthermore, analysis of peripheral blood samples revealed a positive correlation between the levels of circulating IgG B cell receptors and disease activity scores in rheumatoid arthritis patients. These findings suggest that IgG B cell receptors may play a crucial role in the dysregulated immune response observed in rheumatoid arthritis. Targeting IgG B cell receptors could offer a potential therapeutic approach for modulating the autoimmune response in rheumatoid arthritis patients.
