prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: adaptor protein-5 adaptor. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we aimed to investigate the role of the adaptor protein-5 adaptor in the intracellular trafficking of proteins in neurons. Through the use of knockout mouse models, we found that the absence of the adaptor protein-5 adaptor led to abnormal accumulation of synaptic vesicle proteins in neuronal cell bodies, indicating a disruption in protein transport within the neuron. Furthermore, we observed an increase in neurodegenerative phenotypes in these knockout mice, suggesting a potential link between the adaptor protein-5 adaptor and neurodegenerative diseases. Our findings shed light on the importance of the adaptor protein-5 adaptor in maintaining proper protein trafficking within neurons and its potential implications in neurodegenerative disorders.
