prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: serotonin receptor. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we investigated the role of the serotonin receptor in the pathogenesis of depression in a cohort of patients diagnosed with major depressive disorder. Analysis of post-mortem brain tissue samples revealed a significant upregulation of serotonin receptor expression in the prefrontal cortex of these individuals compared to a control group. Additionally, levels of serotonin, the neurotransmitter that binds to the serotonin receptor, were found to be significantly reduced in the cerebrospinal fluid of patients with depression. These findings suggest a potential dysregulation of the serotonin signaling pathway in the context of depressive disorders, highlighting the importance of further research into the modulation of serotonin receptor activity as a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of depression.
