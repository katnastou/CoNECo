prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: CGRP receptors. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: Activation of CGRP receptors has been implicated in the pathogenesis of migraine, making them a promising target for therapeutic intervention. In a recent study, the effects of a novel small molecule antagonist on CGRP receptors were investigated in a preclinical mouse model of migraine. Treatment with the antagonist resulted in a significant reduction in both the frequency and severity of migraine-like episodes, indicating its potential as a therapeutic agent. Additionally, the study found that the antagonist did not exert any significant off-target effects on other receptors or induce adverse events. These findings provide valuable insight into the potential use of CGRP receptor antagonists for the treatment of migraine, highlighting the importance of further research to explore their clinical relevance.
