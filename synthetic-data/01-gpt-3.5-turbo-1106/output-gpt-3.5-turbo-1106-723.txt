prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: cullin-RING ligase 3. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The cullin-RING ligase 3 (CRL3) is a key component of the cellular ubiquitination machinery and has been implicated in numerous pathways implicated in various diseases. Recent studies have highlighted the role of CRL3 in the regulation of cell cycle progression, DNA damage response, and hypoxia signaling. Dysregulation of CRL3 has been associated with tumorigenesis, cardiovascular diseases, and neurodegenerative disorders. Furthermore, small molecule inhibitors targeting CRL3 have shown promising results in preclinical models of cancer, suggesting the potential for CRL3 as a therapeutic target in various disease contexts. Further investigation of the precise mechanisms of CRL3 function and its potential as a therapeutic target is warranted to exploit its role in disease pathology.
