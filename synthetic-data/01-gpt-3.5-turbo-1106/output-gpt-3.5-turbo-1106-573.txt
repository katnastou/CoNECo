prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: BC3B. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we investigated the role of the BC3B protein complex in the progression of colorectal cancer. Utilizing a cohort of human colorectal tumor samples and corresponding adjacent normal tissues, we observed a significant upregulation of BC3B in the tumor samples compared to the normal tissues. Furthermore, we explored the association between BC3B expression levels and key clinicopathological parameters, including tumor stage, lymph node involvement, and patient survival. Our findings indicate a positive correlation between elevated BC3B expression and advanced tumor stage, lymph node metastasis, and poor overall survival in colorectal cancer patients. Additionally, we identified potential regulatory molecules that interact with BC3B, shedding light on the underlying molecular mechanisms driving its oncogenic functions. Overall, our results underscore the potential of BC3B as a prognostic biomarker and therapeutic target for colorectal cancer.
