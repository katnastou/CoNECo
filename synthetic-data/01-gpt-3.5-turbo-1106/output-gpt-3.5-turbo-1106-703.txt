prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: myrosinase. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we investigated the effect of sulforaphane, a natural isothiocyanate compound found in cruciferous vegetables, on the activity of the myrosinase protein complex. We utilized in vitro assays to analyze the enzymatic activity of myrosinase in the presence of various concentrations of sulforaphane. Our results demonstrated a dose-dependent inhibition of myrosinase activity by sulforaphane, suggesting a potential regulatory effect of this compound on the enzymatic function of myrosinase. Furthermore, we also evaluated the impact of sulforaphane on the expression levels of myrosinase in human cell lines. Our findings provide insight into the interaction between sulforaphane and myrosinase, highlighting a potential mechanism for modulating myrosinase activity that may have implications for dietary and therapeutic interventions targeting cancer and inflammatory diseases.
