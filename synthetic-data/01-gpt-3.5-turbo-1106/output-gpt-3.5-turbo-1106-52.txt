prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: GATOR2. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The GATOR2 protein complex has emerged as a critical regulator of cellular metabolism and growth in various organisms. Through its complex interplay with the mTOR pathway, GATOR2 has been implicated in the control of important cellular processes such as autophagy, ribosome biogenesis, and lipid metabolism. Dysfunction of the GATOR2 complex has been linked to a range of human diseases, including cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, and metabolic disorders. Furthermore, recent studies have identified potential small molecule modulators of GATOR2 activity, opening up new avenues for therapeutic intervention in diseases related to GATOR2 dysregulation. This highlights the significance of further investigating the precise molecular mechanisms underlying the role of GATOR2 in cellular homeostasis and disease pathogenesis.
