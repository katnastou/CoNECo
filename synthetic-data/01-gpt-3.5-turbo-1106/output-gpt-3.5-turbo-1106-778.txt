prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: box H/ACA scaRNP. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The box H/ACA scaRNP is a crucial ribonucleoprotein complex involved in the biogenesis of small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs), which play a key role in post-transcriptional modification of ribosomal RNAs. Dysregulation of snoRNA biogenesis has been implicated in various human diseases, such as X-linked dyskeratosis congenita and cancer. In this study, we investigated the role of the box H/ACA scaRNP in the context of telomere maintenance, a process tightly linked to cellular aging and carcinogenesis. Our findings reveal a novel interaction between the box H/ACA scaRNP and telomerase, shedding light on the intricate molecular pathways underlying telomere maintenance and offering potential new targets for therapeutic interventions in diseases associated with impaired telomere function.
