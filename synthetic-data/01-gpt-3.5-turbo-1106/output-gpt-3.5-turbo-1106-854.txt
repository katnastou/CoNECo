prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: Ribonucleoside diphosphate reductases. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we investigated the interactions between Ribonucleoside diphosphate reductases (RNRs) and their regulatory proteins in a mouse model of breast cancer. Our results demonstrate a significant upregulation of RNR activity in tumor tissues compared to healthy controls, suggesting a potential role for RNRs in breast cancer progression. Furthermore, we observed a correlation between RNR expression levels and tumor size, implicating RNRs in the proliferation of cancer cells. Additionally, we identified novel small molecule inhibitors targeting RNRs, which showed promising anti-tumor efficacy in in vivo experiments. These findings provide valuable insights into the functional significance of RNRs in breast cancer and offer potential therapeutic targets for further exploration.
