prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: mitochondrial ubiquinol-cytochrome-c reductase. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: Mitochondrial ubiquinol-cytochrome-c reductase (complex III) plays a critical role in the electron transport chain, catalyzing the transfer of electrons from ubiquinol to cytochrome c. Dysfunction of this complex has been implicated in a range of pathological conditions, including mitochondrial encephalomyopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episodes (MELAS) syndrome. Recent studies have highlighted the potential of small molecule modulators to regulate the activity of complex III and thereby influence cellular bioenergetics. Furthermore, the integration of pharmacological strategies targeting this complex with existing therapeutic approaches holds promise in the treatment of a variety of mitochondrial diseases. Future research efforts aiming to elucidate the structural and functional properties of mitochondrial ubiquinol-cytochrome-c reductase are warranted to advance our understanding of its role in health and disease.
