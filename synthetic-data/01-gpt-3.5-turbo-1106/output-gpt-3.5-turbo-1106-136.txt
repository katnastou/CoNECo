prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: dRAF. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we investigated the role of the dRAF protein complex in the progression of colorectal cancer. We used a mouse model of the disease to assess the impact of dRAF inhibition on tumor growth and metastasis. Our findings revealed that targeting dRAF significantly suppressed tumor growth and reduced the number of metastatic lesions. Additionally, we observed a decrease in the expression of key oncogenic signaling pathways, including the MAPK pathway, upon dRAF inhibition. These results suggest that dRAF plays a critical role in promoting the aggressiveness of colorectal cancer and may serve as a potential therapeutic target for intervention in the disease progression.
