prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: endoSceI. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: A recent study investigated the potential role of the endoSceI protein complex in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease. The study utilized transgenic mouse models expressing mutated human amyloid precursor protein to mimic the disease progression. Treatment with a small molecule inhibitor targeting the endoSceI complex resulted in a significant reduction in amyloid beta deposition and improvement in cognitive function. Furthermore, downstream analysis revealed a decrease in neuroinflammation and tau hyperphosphorylation levels in the treated mice compared to the control group. These findings suggest that targeting the endoSceI complex may hold promise as a therapeutic strategy for Alzheimer's disease. Further elucidation of the molecular mechanisms underlying the interaction between the endoSceI complex and disease pathology may provide valuable insights for the development of effective treatments.
