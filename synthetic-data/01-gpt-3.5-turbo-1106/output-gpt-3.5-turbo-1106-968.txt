prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: SufE. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we investigated the role of the SufE protein complex in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease. Through in vitro experiments, we identified a novel small molecule that interacts directly with the SufE complex, thereby modulating its activity. In a preclinical mouse model, we found that administration of this small molecule resulted in a significant reduction in neuroinflammation and improved motor function. Furthermore, we observed a decrease in Î±-synuclein aggregation in the brains of treated mice. These findings suggest that targeting the SufE complex with small molecules may represent a promising therapeutic strategy for Parkinson's disease.
