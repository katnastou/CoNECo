prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: polycystins. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: Polycystins are a group of integral membrane proteins that play a critical role in the development and maintenance of renal epithelial cell structure and function. Mutations in the genes encoding polycystins have been linked to autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease, a common genetic disorder characterized by the formation of numerous fluid-filled cysts in the kidneys. The polycystin 1 and polycystin 2 proteins form a heteromeric complex at the primary cilium of renal epithelial cells, where they function as mechanosensors involved in the regulation of intracellular calcium levels. Dysregulation of polycystin complex activity has been implicated in the pathogenesis of polycystic kidney disease, highlighting the importance of further investigating the molecular mechanisms underlying the function of this protein complex in renal homeostasis.
