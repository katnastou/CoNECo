prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: Constitutive centromere associated network. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The Constitutive centromere associated network (CCAN) is a vital protein complex that plays a critical role in maintaining genomic stability and ensuring proper chromosome segregation during cell division. Dysregulation of the CCAN has been implicated in a variety of human disorders, including certain types of cancer and developmental abnormalities. Recent studies have identified potential small molecule inhibitors that target specific components of the CCAN, offering promise for the development of novel therapeutic interventions. Furthermore, elucidating the molecular mechanisms underlying the assembly and regulation of the CCAN will provide valuable insights into its functional significance and may pave the way for innovative approaches to combat diseases associated with CCAN dysfunction.
