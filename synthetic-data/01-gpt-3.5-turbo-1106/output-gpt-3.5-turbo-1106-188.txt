prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: minus-end kinesin. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The minus-end kinesin protein complex has been implicated in various cellular processes, including intracellular transport and mitosis. Recent studies have shown that dysregulation of the minus-end kinesin complex may be involved in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease. Additionally, the expression level of the minus-end kinesin complex has been observed to be altered in cancer cells, suggesting its potential role in tumorigenesis. Understanding the molecular mechanisms and regulatory pathways governing the function of the minus-end kinesin complex may offer new insights into the development of therapeutic strategies targeting neurodegenerative disorders and cancer. Further investigation into the biological functions and associated signaling pathways of the minus-end kinesin complex is warranted to uncover its potential as a therapeutic target for disease intervention.
