prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: R2TP. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The R2TP protein complex has been identified as a crucial molecular chaperone required for the assembly and stabilization of key cellular machineries. In recent studies, the involvement of R2TP in the regulation of oncogenic pathways has garnered substantial interest, with potential implications for cancer therapeutics. Additionally, the role of R2TP in the maintenance of telomere integrity and the assembly of several essential protein-RNA complexes has been elucidated. The multifunctional nature of R2TP suggests its potential as a therapeutic target for diseases characterized by dysregulated protein-folding pathways, including neurodegenerative disorders and protein misfolding diseases. Further investigations into the regulatory mechanisms and interaction partners of the R2TP complex are warranted to fully understand its impact on cellular homeostasis and disease pathogenesis.
