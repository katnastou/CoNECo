prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: interleukin-23. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: Interleukin-23 (IL-23) has emerged as a pivotal player in the pathogenesis of various immune-mediated diseases. IL-23 is a heterodimeric cytokine consisting of two subunits, p19 and p40, which are encoded by the genes IL23A and IL12B, respectively. The IL-23 receptor is expressed predominantly on activated T cells, natural killer cells, and myeloid cells, highlighting its role in the regulation of immune responses. Dysregulation of the IL-23 pathway has been implicated in the development of inflammatory bowel disease, psoriasis, and ankylosing spondylitis. Thus, targeting IL-23 has garnered significant attention as a promising therapeutic strategy for these debilitating conditions. Studies investigating the efficacy of IL-23 inhibitors have shown promising results, opening new avenues for the treatment of immune-mediated disorders.
