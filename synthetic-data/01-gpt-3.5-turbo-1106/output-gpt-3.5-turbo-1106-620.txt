prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: small ribonucleoproteins. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: Small ribonucleoproteins (snRNPs) play a crucial role in gene expression and have been implicated in various human diseases. Recent studies have identified a potential relationship between the dysregulation of small ribonucleoproteins and the pathogenesis of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), a complex autoimmune disorder characterized by widespread inflammation and tissue damage. The aberrant function of small ribonucleoproteins in SLE may contribute to the production of self-reactive autoantibodies, leading to the progressive immune-mediated destruction of vital organs such as the kidneys and heart. Furthermore, the interaction between small ribonucleoproteins and specific non-coding RNAs has been suggested to modulate cellular processes associated with tumor development and progression. Understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying the dysregulation of small ribonucleoproteins may offer potential therapeutic targets for the treatment of SLE and certain malignancies.
