prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: IGP synthase. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we investigated the role of the IGP synthase protein complex in the progression of muscular dystrophy in a mouse model. Our results demonstrated a significant upregulation of IGP synthase expression in the skeletal muscle tissues of dystrophic mice compared to healthy controls. Furthermore, we observed a positive correlation between the expression levels of IGP synthase and the severity of muscle degeneration. Interestingly, treatment with a small-molecule inhibitor targeting IGP synthase led to a significant improvement in muscle function and reduced fibrosis in the dystrophic mice. These findings suggest that targeting the IGP synthase protein complex may hold therapeutic potential for the treatment of muscular dystrophy and related muscle disorders.
