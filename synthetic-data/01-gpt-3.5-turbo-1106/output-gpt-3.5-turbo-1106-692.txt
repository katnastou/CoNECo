prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: coatomer. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The coatomer complex is an essential component in the intracellular vesicle trafficking pathways, playing a crucial role in maintaining the integrity of the Golgi apparatus. Numerous studies have implicated the coatomer complex in various human diseases, including certain neurodegenerative disorders and infectious diseases. For example, perturbations in coatomer function have been linked to the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease and hepatitis C infection. Additionally, small molecule inhibitors targeting specific subunits of the coatomer complex have shown promise as potential therapeutic agents for combating certain viral infections. Understanding the regulatory mechanisms and functional interactions of the coatomer complex will provide valuable insights into the pathological processes underlying these diseases and may lead to the development of novel treatment strategies.
