prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: PDHE1. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The pyruvate dehydrogenase complex, referred to as PDHE1, plays a crucial role in cellular metabolism by catalyzing the conversion of pyruvate to acetyl-CoA. Dysregulation of PDHE1 has been implicated in various metabolic disorders, including diabetes mellitus and obesity. Previous studies have shown that phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of PDHE1 can modulate its activity, leading to potential therapeutic targets for metabolic diseases. Additionally, the interaction between PDHE1 and its allosteric regulators, such as NAD+ and CoA, further highlights the intricate regulation of this complex in maintaining metabolic homeostasis. Understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying PDHE1 regulation and function may provide novel insights for the development of targeted therapies for metabolic disorders.
