prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: NADH-Q6 oxidoreductase. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we aimed to investigate the role of NADH-Q6 oxidoreductase in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease. Using a mouse model of the disease, we observed a significant decrease in the activity of NADH-Q6 oxidoreductase in the substantia nigra region of the brain. Furthermore, we found a correlation between the reduced enzyme activity and the accumulation of reactive oxygen species in the dopaminergic neurons. Our results suggest that dysfunction of NADH-Q6 oxidoreductase may contribute to the oxidative stress observed in Parkinson's disease, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target for the treatment of this debilitating neurodegenerative disorder.
