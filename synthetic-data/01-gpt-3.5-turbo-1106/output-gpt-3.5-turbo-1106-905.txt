prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: HU-DNA. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The HU-DNA complex has been extensively studied due to its critical role in bacterial genome compaction and regulation of gene expression. HU, a small histone-like protein, binds non-specifically to DNA and is involved in the formation of higher-order DNA structures. Recent research has highlighted the potential of targeting the HU-DNA complex as a novel antibacterial strategy, particularly in the context of antibiotic-resistant bacterial infections. Furthermore, dysregulation of HU-DNA complex function has been implicated in the pathogenesis of certain bacterial diseases, making it an attractive target for drug development. Understanding the structural and functional properties of the HU-DNA complex is crucial for the development of therapeutic interventions aimed at combatting bacterial infections and associated diseases.
