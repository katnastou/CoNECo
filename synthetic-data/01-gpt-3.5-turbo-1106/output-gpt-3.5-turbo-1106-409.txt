prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: TOB. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: Recent studies have implicated the TOB protein complex in the regulation of cell proliferation and survival. In colorectal cancer, dysregulation of the TOB complex has been linked to aberrant cell cycle progression and increased tumor growth. Furthermore, the complex has been shown to interact with several key signaling pathways, including the TGF-Î² and Wnt signaling pathways, suggesting its involvement in diverse cellular processes. Targeting the TOB complex may hold promise as a therapeutic strategy for cancer and other proliferative disorders. Further investigation into the molecular mechanisms underlying TOB complex function is warranted to elucidate its potential as a therapeutic target.
