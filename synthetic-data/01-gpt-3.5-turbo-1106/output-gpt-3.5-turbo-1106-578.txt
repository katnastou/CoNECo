prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: CSC. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The centromere-specific chromatin complex (CSC) is a crucial player in the maintenance of genome stability and cell division. This complex consists of a multitude of proteins and epigenetic modifiers that orchestrate the structure and function of the centromere in eukaryotic cells. Dysregulation of CSC has been implicated in various human diseases, including cancer and infertility, highlighting its significance in human health. Recent studies have identified small molecule inhibitors that target specific components of CSC, opening up potential therapeutic avenues for the treatment of centromere-related disorders. Further investigation of the molecular interactions within CSC and its role in disease pathogenesis holds promise for the development of novel therapeutic interventions.
