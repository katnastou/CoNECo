prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: Geranylgeranyl transferase type II. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: Our study focused on investigating the potential role of the Geranylgeranyl transferase type II (GGTase-II) protein complex in the pathogenesis of age-related macular degeneration (AMD). Using a murine model of AMD, we assessed the expression and activity of GGTase-II in the retinal pigmented epithelial cells. Our findings revealed an upregulation of GGTase-II activity in the presence of oxidative stress, a known contributor to AMD progression. Furthermore, inhibition of GGTase-II activity using a specific small molecule inhibitor resulted in a reduction of drusen formation and preservation of retinal function in the murine model. These results indicate a potential role for GGTase-II in the pathogenesis of AMD, highlighting the complex interplay between protein prenylation and retinal degenerative diseases. This study provides a foundation for further investigations into the therapeutic potential of targeting GGTase-II in AMD.
