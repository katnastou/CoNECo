prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: 20S core. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we investigated the potential role of the 20S core protein complex in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease. Our results demonstrate a significant upregulation of the 20S core complex in the substantia nigra of post-mortem brains from Parkinson's disease patients compared to age-matched controls. Furthermore, immunohistochemical analysis revealed co-localization of the 20S core complex with α-synuclein aggregates in affected brain regions. Additionally, pharmacological inhibition of the 20S core complex using specific inhibitors led to a reduction in α-synuclein aggregation and ameliorated motor deficits in a pre-clinical model of Parkinson's disease. These findings suggest a potential link between the 20S core complex and the pathophysiology of Parkinson's disease, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target for disease modification.
