prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: RC. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: Our study aimed to investigate the potential role of the RC protein complex in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease. We utilized a transgenic mouse model overexpressing Î±-synuclein, a known contributor to Parkinson's disease pathology, to examine the impact of RC complex dysregulation on disease progression. Our findings revealed that altered RC complex activity led to a significant increase in neuroinflammation and dopaminergic neuron degeneration, characteristic features of Parkinson's disease. Furthermore, we observed a corresponding elevation in oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction in the affected brain regions. These results suggest a potential link between RC complex dysfunction and the molecular pathways underlying Parkinson's disease, highlighting the importance of further investigating the therapeutic potential of targeting the RC complex in mitigating disease progression.
