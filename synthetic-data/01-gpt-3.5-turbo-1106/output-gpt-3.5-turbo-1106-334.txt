model: gpt-3.5-turbo-1106
prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: outer kinetochore. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The outer kinetochore is a critical protein complex involved in the attachment of microtubules to the centromere of chromosomes during cell division. This complex plays a pivotal role in ensuring accurate segregation of genetic material, and any disruption in its function can lead to chromosomal instability and aneuploidy, which are linked to various human diseases, including cancer. Recent research has identified novel small molecule inhibitors that selectively target the outer kinetochore proteins, demonstrating promising anti-proliferative effects in cancer cell lines. These findings highlight the potential therapeutic significance of targeting the outer kinetochore in treating cancer and provide a valuable framework for the development of novel anti-cancer agents that exploit the vulnerabilities of this essential cellular machinery.
