prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: Nup82. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The Nup82 protein complex plays a critical role in the regulation of nuclear pore complex (NPC) function in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Recent studies have shown that Nup82 interacts with the Nup159 and Nup116 proteins, forming an essential component of the NPC structure. Additionally, the Nup82 complex has been implicated in the transport of mRNA and ribosomal subunits between the nucleus and cytoplasm. Dysregulation of the Nup82 complex has been linked to various human diseases, including certain types of cancers and neurodegenerative disorders. Furthermore, small molecule inhibitors targeting the Nup82 complex have shown promise as potential therapeutic agents for the treatment of certain malignancies. Further elucidation of the molecular mechanisms underlying the function of the Nup82 complex may pave the way for the development of novel strategies for the prevention and treatment of Nup82-related pathologies.
