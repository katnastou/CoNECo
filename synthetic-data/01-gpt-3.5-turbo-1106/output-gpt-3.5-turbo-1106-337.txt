prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: MSL. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: Our study investigated the role of the MSL protein complex in the pathogenesis of Huntington's disease. We generated a mouse model with a knockdown of MSL expression to assess the impact on disease progression. Our results show that decreased MSL levels correlate with exacerbated neurodegeneration and motor impairment in the mouse model, suggesting a potential protective role of the MSL complex in Huntington's disease. Furthermore, we identified a novel pharmacological approach to modulate MSL activity, which led to amelioration of disease phenotypes in our model system. This research highlights the importance of understanding the molecular mechanisms involving the MSL complex in neurodegenerative disorders and provides new avenues for therapeutic interventions.
