prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: RTC. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The role of the RTC protein complex in the regulation of inflammation in atherosclerosis has been a topic of increasing interest. Previous studies have shown that RTC plays a crucial role in the modulation of inflammatory responses within the atherosclerotic plaque. In this study, we investigated the potential therapeutic effects of targeting RTC in a murine model of atherosclerosis. Our results demonstrate that inhibition of RTC led to a significant reduction in the development of atherosclerotic lesions and a marked decrease in pro-inflammatory cytokine production. These findings suggest that targeting RTC may provide a novel therapeutic strategy to mitigate inflammation and progression of atherosclerosis. Further research is warranted to elucidate the precise mechanisms by which RTC influences inflammation in atherosclerosis and to explore the potential clinical implications of RTC inhibition in the treatment of this prevalent cardiovascular disease.
