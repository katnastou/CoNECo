prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: ESCRT3. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The endosomal sorting complex required for transport 3 (ESCRT3) is a highly conserved protein complex involved in the multivesicular body (MVB) pathway, which regulates the turnover of cell surface receptors and the sorting of ubiquitinated cargo for lysosomal degradation. Dysregulation of the ESCRT3 complex has been implicated in various diseases, including viral infections, neurodegenerative disorders, and cancer progression. The ability of ESCRT3 to facilitate proper endosomal sorting and membrane budding is crucial for maintaining cellular homeostasis and preventing the accumulation of toxic protein aggregates. In addition, ESCRT3 has been identified as a key player in the biogenesis of exosomes, which are small extracellular vesicles involved in intercellular communication and disease pathogenesis. Understanding the intricate roles of ESCRT3 in cellular physiology and disease pathology will contribute to the development of novel therapeutic strategies targeting ESCRT-associated pathways.
