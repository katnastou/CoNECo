prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: investment cones. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: Investment cones, a crucial protein complex involved in cell signaling pathways, has been found to play a significant role in the development and progression of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's. Recent studies have demonstrated the regulatory function of investment cones in modulating the activity of key enzymes involved in amyloid beta accumulation, a hallmark feature of Alzheimer's pathology. Furthermore, the dysregulation of investment cones has been linked to aberrant synaptic function and neuronal loss, contributing to the cognitive decline observed in Alzheimer's disease. Targeting investment cones may offer novel therapeutic strategies for mitigating neuronal dysfunction and ameliorating the progression of neurodegenerative conditions. Further investigation of investment cones' precise mechanisms and interaction networks is essential for elucidating their potential as therapeutic targets in the treatment of neurodegenerative disorders.
