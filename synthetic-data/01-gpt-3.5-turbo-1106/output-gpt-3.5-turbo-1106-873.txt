prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: anaerobic ribonucleoside-triphosphate reductase. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In recent years, the anaerobic ribonucleoside-triphosphate reductase (ARTR) has gained attention as a potential therapeutic target for treating anaerobic bacterial infections. Studies have demonstrated that ARTR plays a crucial role in the reduction of ribonucleoside triphosphates to deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates, which are essential for DNA synthesis. Inhibition of ARTR activity has been shown to impair bacterial replication and survival under low oxygen conditions. Furthermore, the development of small molecule inhibitors targeting ARTR has shown promise in preclinical models of anaerobic bacterial infections. As the prevalence of antibiotic resistance continues to rise, targeting essential enzymes like ARTR may represent a novel approach to combatting anaerobic bacterial pathogens and addressing the global health threat posed by these infections.
