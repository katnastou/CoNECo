prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: MECO. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: Recent studies have identified a critical role for the MECO protein complex in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease. The dysregulation of MECO has been shown to impact the clearance of amyloid-beta peptides, leading to their accumulation and subsequent formation of neurotoxic plaques. Furthermore, the disruption of MECO has been associated with synaptic dysfunction and cognitive decline in mouse models of Alzheimer's disease. These findings underscore the potential of targeting MECO as a therapeutic strategy for alleviating the neurodegenerative consequences of Alzheimer's disease. Further investigation into the molecular mechanisms underlying the function of MECO is warranted to uncover novel targets for drug intervention in Alzheimer's disease.
