prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: divisome. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The divisome is a vital multi-protein complex that plays a crucial role in bacterial cell division. Various studies have elucidated the intricate interplay of proteins within the divisome, including FtsZ, FtsA, and ZipA, among others. Dysregulation of the divisome has been associated with significant cellular abnormalities and is implicated in the pathogenesis of various infectious diseases. Targeting the divisome has emerged as a promising strategy for the development of novel antimicrobial agents to combat antibiotic-resistant bacterial pathogens. Understanding the structure and function of the divisome holds great potential for the development of therapeutic interventions to mitigate the impact of bacterial infections on human health.
