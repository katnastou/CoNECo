prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: HCN4 channel. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The HCN4 channel, a critical component of the cardiac pacemaker current, plays a pivotal role in the regulation of cardiac rhythm. Dysregulation or malfunction of the HCN4 channel has been associated with various cardiac arrhythmias, including sinus node dysfunction and atrial fibrillation. Recent studies have highlighted the potential of small molecule modulators targeting the HCN4 channel as promising therapeutic options for the management of cardiac arrhythmias. Furthermore, genetic variations in the HCN4 channel gene have been implicated in the pathogenesis of inherited arrhythmia syndromes, providing crucial insights into the genetic basis of cardiac rhythm disorders. These findings underscore the significance of the HCN4 channel as a potential target for the development of novel antiarrhythmic strategies and genetic screening approaches aimed at preventing inherited cardiac arrhythmias.
