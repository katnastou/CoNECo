prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: apical TBC. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we aimed to investigate the role of the apical TBC complex in the regulation of epithelial cell polarity in the context of colorectal cancer progression. We utilized a murine xenograft model to assess the effect of chemotherapeutic agents on tumor growth and metastasis in the presence or absence of apical TBC. Our findings revealed that the downregulation of apical TBC resulted in increased tumor infiltration and metastatic spread, further implicating the significance of apical TBC in tumor suppression. Furthermore, we observed a positive correlation between the expression of apical TBC and the activation of the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway in tumor cells, suggesting a potential mechanism of action for apical TBC in colorectal cancer progression. This study sheds light on the potential therapeutic targets associated with apical TBC and its implications for cancer treatment strategies.
