prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: IRF. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In our study, we investigated the role of the IRF protein complex in the regulation of immune responses in a murine model of autoimmune hepatitis. We found that the presence of the IRF complex was associated with increased expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis factor-alpha, in the liver tissue of affected mice. Additionally, we observed a higher frequency of CD4+ T cells infiltrating the liver parenchyma in mice with elevated IRF complex activity. Importantly, pharmacological inhibition of the IRF complex with the compound VX-145 significantly reduced liver inflammation and improved liver function in these animals. Our findings demonstrate the potential therapeutic value of targeting the IRF complex in the treatment of autoimmune hepatitis and highlight its central role in the regulation of hepatic immune responses.
