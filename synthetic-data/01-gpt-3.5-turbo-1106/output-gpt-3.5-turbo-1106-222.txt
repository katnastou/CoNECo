prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: MEFV inflammasomes. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The role of MEFV inflammasomes in the pathogenesis of familial Mediterranean fever (FMF) has garnered significant attention in recent research. FMF is an autoinflammatory disorder characterized by recurrent episodes of fever, serositis, and joint pain. The MEFV gene encodes the protein pyrin, which is involved in the assembly of MEFV inflammasomes in response to danger signals such as infectious agents or cellular damage. Upon activation, MEFV inflammasomes mediate the cleavage of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-1Î² and IL-18, leading to an inflammatory response. Understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying the formation and activation of MEFV inflammasomes is crucial for developing targeted therapies for FMF and other autoinflammatory diseases.
