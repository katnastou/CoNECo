prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: mature HDLs. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: Recent research has implicated mature HDLs in the modulation of atherosclerosis, a major cause of cardiovascular disease. Mature HDLs, known for their role in reverse cholesterol transport, have been shown to possess anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties that contribute to their protective effect against atherosclerosis. Experimental evidence has demonstrated that mature HDLs enhance cholesterol efflux from macrophages and reduce the formation of foam cells, thus inhibiting the progression of atherosclerotic plaques. Furthermore, studies have highlighted the potential of mature HDLs to attenuate endothelial dysfunction and inhibit the activation of adhesion molecules, which are crucial steps in the initiation and progression of atherosclerosis. These findings underscore the therapeutic potential of targeting mature HDLs in the management of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease.
