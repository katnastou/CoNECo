prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: ESCRT-IV. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The endosomal sorting complex required for transport-IV (ESCRT-IV) is known to play a critical role in the biogenesis of multivesicular bodies, a process essential for endosomal protein sorting and degradation. Dysfunction of ESCRT-IV has been implicated in various human diseases, including neurodegenerative disorders and cancer. While the precise mechanisms underlying ESCRT-IV function are still under intense investigation, recent studies have highlighted its involvement in the regulation of viral budding and cytokinesis. Additionally, small molecule inhibitors targeting ESCRT-IV components have shown promising results in preclinical models, suggesting potential therapeutic strategies for diseases associated with ESCRT-IV dysfunction. Further elucidation of the molecular interactions and cellular pathways involving ESCRT-IV will undoubtedly provide valuable insights into its physiological and pathological roles.
