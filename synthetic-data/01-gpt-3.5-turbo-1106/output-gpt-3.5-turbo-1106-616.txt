prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: laminin-11. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we investigated the role of laminin-11 in the development of diabetic nephropathy. We used a mouse model of diabetes to examine the effects of laminin-11 deficiency on the progression of kidney disease. Our results demonstrate that the absence of laminin-11 exacerbates glomerular damage and proteinuria in diabetic mice, highlighting the crucial role of this extracellular matrix protein complex in maintaining renal function under diabetic conditions. Furthermore, we found that the expression of laminin-11 is reduced in the diabetic kidney, suggesting a potential link between its downregulation and the pathogenesis of diabetic nephropathy. Understanding the mechanisms underlying the involvement of laminin-11 in this disease may provide novel therapeutic targets for mitigating the progression of diabetic kidney complications.
