prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: inner kinetochore plate. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: Recent research has implicated an essential role for the inner kinetochore plate in the regulation of chromosome segregation during mitosis. The inner kinetochore plate serves as a crucial point of attachment for microtubules, facilitating the proper alignment and separation of chromosomes during cell division. Dysregulation of the inner kinetochore plate has been associated with a range of cellular abnormalities, including aneuploidy and genomic instability, which are common features of cancer development. Understanding the molecular mechanisms involved in the assembly and function of the inner kinetochore plate is of paramount importance for elucidating the pathogenesis of various human diseases, and may provide insights for the development of novel therapeutic strategies targeting aberrant chromosome segregation.
