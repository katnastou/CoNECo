prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: alpha7-beta1 integrin. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The alpha7-beta1 integrin protein complex plays a crucial role in regulating cell adhesion and migration processes, particularly in the context of skeletal muscle regeneration. Previous studies have demonstrated the interaction of this integrin with laminin, a major component of the extracellular matrix (ECM), and have implicated its involvement in the activation of downstream signaling pathways related to myogenesis and muscle repair. In the context of muscular dystrophies, dysregulation of alpha7-beta1 integrin expression and function has been associated with disease progression and muscle degeneration. Targeting this protein complex has emerged as a potential therapeutic strategy for ameliorating the pathophysiology of muscular dystrophies and promoting muscle regeneration. Further elucidation of the molecular mechanisms underlying the function of alpha7-beta1 integrin in muscle biology may hold promise for the development of targeted interventions for neuromuscular disorders.
