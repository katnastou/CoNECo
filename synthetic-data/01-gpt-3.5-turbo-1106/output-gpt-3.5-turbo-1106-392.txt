prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: GII. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The GII protein complex has been the subject of extensive study due to its putative role in regulating cell cycle progression. Previous research has shown that GII interacts with various cellular kinases and phosphatases, suggesting its involvement in signal transduction pathways. In a recent study, the effects of GII inhibition on cancer cell proliferation were investigated using a panel of small molecule inhibitors. Interestingly, treatment with a specific GII inhibitor led to a significant decrease in the viability of breast cancer cells, suggesting a potential therapeutic strategy for targeting this protein complex in cancer therapy. These findings highlight the importance of further investigating the molecular mechanisms underlying GII function and its potential as a druggable target for cancer treatment.
