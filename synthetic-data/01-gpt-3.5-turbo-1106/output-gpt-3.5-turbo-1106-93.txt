prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: positive transcription elongation factor complex b. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The positive transcription elongation factor complex b (P-TEFb) has emerged as a pivotal regulator of gene expression in various cellular processes. This intricate complex plays a central role in the facilitation of transcriptional elongation by RNA polymerase II, thereby exerting substantial influence on the expression of genes critical for cell development and function. Dysregulation of P-TEFb has been implicated in a range of diseases, including cancer and viral infections, underscoring the significance of its precise control. Recent studies have revealed potential small molecule inhibitors as promising candidates for therapeutic intervention in diseases where the aberrant activity of P-TEFb is implicated. Characterizing the intricate interactions and regulatory mechanisms of P-TEFb promises to shed light on novel avenues for targeted therapeutic strategies in various pathological conditions.
