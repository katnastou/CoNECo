prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: PGGT. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In recent studies, the potential role of the prenyltransferase protein complex known as PGGT has been explored in the context of cancer progression. PGGT is involved in the prenylation of small G proteins, which play a crucial role in intracellular signaling pathways. Dysregulation of these signaling pathways has been implicated in the development and progression of various types of cancer. Understanding the precise mechanisms by which PGGT contributes to cancer progression may hold potential for the development of targeted therapeutics aimed at disrupting these pathways. Furthermore, the exploration of PGGT inhibitors as a potential strategy for cancer treatment warrants further investigation. This research may lead to the development of novel therapeutic approaches aimed at disrupting the activity of PGGT and its downstream signaling pathways, thereby offering potential avenues for the treatment of cancer.
