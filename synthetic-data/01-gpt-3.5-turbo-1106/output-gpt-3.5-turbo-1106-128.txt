prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: HDL2. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we investigated the potential therapeutic effects of a novel small molecule compound, X-23, on the levels of HDL2 in a mouse model of atherosclerosis. We observed that treatment with X-23 resulted in a significant increase in the levels of HDL2 in the plasma of treated mice compared to the control group. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the elevated HDL2 levels correlated with a reduction in atherosclerotic plaque formation and a decrease in serum cholesterol levels. These findings suggest that modulation of HDL2 levels by X-23 may represent a promising strategy for the treatment of atherosclerosis and related cardiovascular diseases.
