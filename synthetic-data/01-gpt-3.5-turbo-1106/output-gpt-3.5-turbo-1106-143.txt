prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: TGF-beta ligand-receptor. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we investigated the role of the TGF-beta ligand-receptor complex in the pathogenesis of pulmonary fibrosis. Our results demonstrate that aberrant signaling through the TGF-beta ligand-receptor complex is associated with the progression of pulmonary fibrosis in a murine model. Furthermore, we observed a significant upregulation of TGF-beta ligand-receptor expression in lung tissues from patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis compared to healthy controls. These findings suggest that targeting the TGF-beta ligand-receptor complex may represent a promising therapeutic strategy for the treatment of pulmonary fibrosis. Overall, our study provides new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying pulmonary fibrosis and identifies the TGF-beta ligand-receptor complex as a potential therapeutic target for this devastating disease.
