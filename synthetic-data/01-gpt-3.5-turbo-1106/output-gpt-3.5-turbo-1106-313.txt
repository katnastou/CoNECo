prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: DNA helicases. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: DNA helicases are essential enzymes that play a crucial role in various cellular processes, including DNA replication, repair, and recombination. These motor proteins use ATP hydrolysis to unwind DNA double helices, allowing access to the genetic information stored within. Dysregulation of DNA helicase activity has been implicated in a range of human diseases, including cancer and neurodegenerative disorders. Recent studies have identified potential small molecule inhibitors that target DNA helicases, opening new avenues for therapeutic intervention in diseases characterized by aberrant DNA metabolism. Further research is needed to elucidate the precise mechanisms of action and potential clinical applications of these inhibitors.
