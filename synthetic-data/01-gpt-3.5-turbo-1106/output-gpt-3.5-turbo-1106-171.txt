prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: miRNA RISCs. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: Recent studies have shown the pivotal role of miRNA RISCs in the regulation of gene expression in various diseases, including cancer and neurological disorders. The dysregulation of miRNA RISCs has been implicated in the pathogenesis of numerous diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease, prostate cancer, and Parkinson's disease. Furthermore, miRNA RISCs have been identified as potential therapeutic targets for developing novel interventions for these debilitating conditions. Understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying the function and dysregulation of miRNA RISCs holds great promise for the development of targeted therapies and precision medicine approaches for a wide range of diseases.
