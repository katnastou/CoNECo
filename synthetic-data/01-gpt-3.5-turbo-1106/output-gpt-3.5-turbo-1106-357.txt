prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: Hydrogenase-2. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The discovery of the key role of the Hydrogenase-2 protein complex in regulating hydrogen production has opened new avenues for research into biofuel production and the potential treatment of metabolic disorders. Hydrogenase-2, together with its associated cofactors, plays a crucial role in the enzymatic conversion of hydrogen gas into energy, offering promise for the development of sustainable energy sources. Furthermore, studies have shown that dysregulation of the Hydrogenase-2 complex is associated with certain metabolic diseases, providing insights into potential therapeutic targets. Understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying the function of Hydrogenase-2 is essential for harnessing its potential for both energy production and human health.
