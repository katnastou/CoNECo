model: gpt-3.5-turbo-1106
prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: WRC. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The WRC (WAVE Regulatory Complex) is a critical regulator of actin cytoskeleton dynamics. This multi-protein complex consists of the subunits Nap1, Abi2, HSPC300, and WAVE, and plays a fundamental role in processes such as cell migration, phagocytosis, and neuronal development. Dysregulation of WRC has been associated with various human diseases, including cancers and neurological disorders. Recent studies have shown that small molecule inhibitors targeting the WRC subunits have potential therapeutic value in the treatment of metastatic cancers and neurodegenerative diseases. Further investigation into the precise mechanisms of WRC regulation and its downstream signaling pathways will provide valuable insights into the development of novel therapeutic interventions for diseases associated with aberrant actin cytoskeleton dynamics.
