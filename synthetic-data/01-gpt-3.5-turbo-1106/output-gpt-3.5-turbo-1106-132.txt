prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: protein acetyltransferases. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In recent years, protein acetyltransferases have emerged as key regulators of cellular processes, exhibiting a pivotal role in modulating the acetylation status of various substrates. This protein complex is implicated in pathophysiological conditions, including cancer, neurodegenerative diseases, and metabolic disorders. The dysregulation of protein acetyltransferases has been associated with aberrant signaling pathways and dysfunctions in chromatin remodeling, leading to altered gene expression patterns. Understanding the mechanisms underlying the activity and specificity of protein acetyltransferases is crucial for the development of novel therapeutic strategies targeting their enzymatic function. Given the broad impact of protein acetyltransferases in human health and disease, further investigations into their intricate molecular interactions and functional implications are warranted for the advancement of biomedical research and the identification of potential drug targets.
