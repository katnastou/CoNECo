prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: inhibin beta-B. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: Inhibin beta-B is a crucial member of the inhibin protein complex family, known for its role in regulating follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) secretion from the pituitary gland. Research has shown that inhibin beta-B plays a fundamental role in reproductive physiology and has been implicated in various reproductive disorders, including polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) and ovarian cancer. In addition to its role in reproductive health, inhibin beta-B has also been linked to bone metabolism and may have implications in bone-related diseases such as osteoporosis. Further investigation into the therapeutic potential of targeting inhibin beta-B in the context of reproductive and bone disorders is warranted.
