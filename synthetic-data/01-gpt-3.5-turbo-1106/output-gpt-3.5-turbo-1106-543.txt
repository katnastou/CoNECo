prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: CstF. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: Recent advances in understanding the role of the CstF protein complex in cancer pathogenesis have shed new light on the molecular mechanisms underlying tumor development. It has been shown that dysregulation of CstF expression is associated with aberrant alternative polyadenylation patterns, leading to the increased stability and expression of oncogenic transcripts in various cancer types. Moreover, several studies have reported a correlation between CstF activity and poor patient prognosis in breast, lung, and colorectal cancers. Interestingly, small molecule inhibitors targeting the CstF complex have emerged as promising candidates for therapeutic intervention, offering potential strategies for the treatment of malignancies driven by dysregulated mRNA processing. These findings highlight the significance of CstF as a potential biomarker and therapeutic target in oncology and underscore the need for further investigations to elucidate its precise role in cancer progression.
