prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: PEP-B. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In recent years, significant progress has been made in elucidating the role of the protein complex PEP-B in cancer development and progression. Studies have revealed that PEP-B exerts its influence through interaction with various signaling pathways, including the PI3K/Akt and MAPK pathways, which are crucial for cell proliferation and survival. Additionally, the dysregulation of PEP-B has been implicated in promoting metastasis and drug resistance in several malignancies, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target. Furthermore, it has been observed that PEP-B expression levels are altered in various tumor types, suggesting its utility as a diagnostic biomarker. These findings underscore the importance of further investigating the molecular mechanisms underlying PEP-B function and exploring its potential clinical applications in cancer management.
