prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: NACA. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In recent years, there has been growing interest in the role of the NACA protein complex in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease. Previous studies have highlighted the potential involvement of NACA in the regulation of amyloid-beta aggregation and neuronal dysfunction, suggesting a crucial link between this protein complex and the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying Alzheimer's disease. Furthermore, emerging evidence has implicated the dysregulation of NACA in the inflammatory responses associated with neurodegenerative disorders, implying a potential therapeutic target for mitigating neuroinflammation in Alzheimer's disease. These findings emphasize the importance of further investigating the molecular mechanisms by which NACA contributes to the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease, paving the way for the development of targeted therapeutic strategies aimed at modulating NACA activity.
