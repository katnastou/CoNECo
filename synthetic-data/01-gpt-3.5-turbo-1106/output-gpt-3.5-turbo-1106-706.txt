prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: NendoU. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The NendoU protein complex has recently been identified as a potential target for antiviral drug development. Previous studies have demonstrated its critical role in viral replication and pathogenesis, particularly in the context of RNA viruses such as coronaviruses and flaviviruses. In a recent study, the interaction of NendoU with a specific chemical compound was found to disrupt its enzymatic activity, resulting in a significant reduction in viral replication in cell culture models. Furthermore, in vivo studies in animal models infected with a range of viral pathogens, including the Flavivirus, have shown promising antiviral effects following treatment with this compound. These findings suggest that targeting the NendoU protein complex could offer a novel therapeutic approach for combating viral infections, particularly those caused by RNA viruses. Further investigation into the potential of NendoU inhibitors in the treatment of viral diseases is warranted, with the aim of translating these promising results into clinical applications for the benefit of human health.
