prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: NAD isocitric dehydrogenase. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we investigated the role of the NAD isocitric dehydrogenase complex in the pathogenesis of diabetic nephropathy. We examined the expression levels of this complex in renal tissues from diabetic and non-diabetic individuals. Our results revealed a significant upregulation of the NAD isocitric dehydrogenase complex in diabetic kidney tissues, suggesting its potential involvement in the development and progression of diabetic nephropathy. Furthermore, we observed a positive correlation between the expression levels of the NAD isocitric dehydrogenase complex and the severity of renal dysfunction in diabetic patients. These findings highlight the potential of targeting the NAD isocitric dehydrogenase complex as a therapeutic strategy for diabetic nephropathy.
