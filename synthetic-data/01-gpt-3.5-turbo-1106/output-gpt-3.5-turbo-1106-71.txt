prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: NLRC4 inflammasome. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: Activation of the NLRC4 inflammasome has been shown to play a critical role in the inflammatory response to microbial infection. Recent studies have implicated NLRC4 inflammasome dysregulation in the pathogenesis of various infectious diseases and inflammatory disorders, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target. Furthermore, the interplay between NLRC4 inflammasome activation and the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin-1Î² has been extensively investigated and shown to contribute to the development of sepsis and other inflammatory conditions. Understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying NLRC4 inflammasome activation and regulation may provide valuable insights into the development of novel treatments for infectious and inflammatory diseases.
