prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: ESCRT-2. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The ESCRT-2 protein complex plays a crucial role in the process of endosomal sorting and membrane trafficking. Recent studies have demonstrated the involvement of ESCRT-2 in the regulation of cytokinesis and the budding of certain enveloped viruses. In addition, dysregulation of ESCRT-2 has been implicated in the pathogenesis of various human diseases, including neurodegenerative disorders and certain types of cancer. This has led to growing interest in targeting ESCRT-2 for therapeutic intervention in these pathological conditions. Further investigation into the molecular mechanisms and cellular pathways involving ESCRT-2 is warranted to better understand its significance in health and disease.
