prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: Baculoviral IAP repeat-containing protein 5. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The role of Baculoviral IAP repeat-containing protein 5 (BIRC5) in cancer progression has attracted significant attention in recent years. Studies have shown that overexpression of BIRC5 is associated with aggressive tumor behavior and resistance to chemotherapy in various cancer types, including breast, ovarian, and lung cancers. Furthermore, its interaction with the mitotic spindle assembly and regulation of apoptosis has been linked to tumor cell survival. In addition, there is increasing evidence suggesting that targeting BIRC5 could provide a potential therapeutic strategy for treating cancer. A deeper understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying BIRC5's involvement in tumorigenesis could lead to the development of novel targeted therapies for cancer patients.
