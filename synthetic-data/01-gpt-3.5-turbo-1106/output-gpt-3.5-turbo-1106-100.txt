prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: secondary cell wall CESAs. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we investigated the role of the secondary cell wall CESAs in the biosynthesis of cellulose in the model plant species Arabidopsis thaliana. Our results demonstrate that mutations in the secondary cell wall CESAs lead to severe alterations in cell wall composition and structure, affecting not only the mechanical properties of the cell wall but also the plant's ability to withstand environmental stresses. Furthermore, our findings suggest a potential link between the dysfunction of secondary cell wall CESAs and the development of certain plant diseases. These insights shed light on the critical role of the secondary cell wall CESAs in plant physiology and highlight their significance as potential targets for biotechnological applications aimed at enhancing plant resilience and biomass production.
