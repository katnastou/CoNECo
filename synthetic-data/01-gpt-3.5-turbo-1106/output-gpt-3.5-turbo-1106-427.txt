prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: sodium channels. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The dysregulation of sodium channels has been implicated in a variety of neurological disorders, including epilepsy, Alzheimer's disease, and pain syndromes. Studies have suggested that alterations in sodium channel function contribute to the pathogenesis of these conditions, and therefore targeting sodium channels has emerged as a potential therapeutic strategy. Recent investigations are focusing on small molecule compounds that modulate sodium channel activity, such as antiepileptic drugs and local anesthetics. Additionally, the development of gene therapy approaches to regulate sodium channel expression and function represents a promising avenue for future research and clinical intervention. Understanding the role of sodium channels in neurological disorders may provide valuable insights for the development of novel treatment modalities.
