prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: MMXD. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: Recent studies have demonstrated a crucial role for the MMXD protein complex in maintaining protein homeostasis within mammalian cells. The MMXD complex is known to interact with various DNA damage repair proteins, such as BRCA1 and RAD51, and has been implicated in the response to genotoxic stress. Furthermore, it has been shown that the MMXD complex is involved in the regulation of cell proliferation and apoptosis pathways, suggesting its potential significance in the development of cancer. Interestingly, chemical inhibition of the MMXD complex has been found to sensitize cancer cells to chemotherapy, providing a potential therapeutic strategy for enhancing the efficacy of current treatment regimens. These findings highlight the importance of further investigating the molecular mechanisms governing the function of the MMXD complex, as it may represent a promising target for the development of novel anti-cancer interventions.
