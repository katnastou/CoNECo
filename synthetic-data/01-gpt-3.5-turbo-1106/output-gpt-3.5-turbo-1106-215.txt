prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: DNA polymerase III, DnaX. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we investigated the interaction between the protein complex DNA polymerase III, DnaX, and the enzyme helicase during DNA replication in Escherichia coli. Through co-immunoprecipitation and Western blot analysis, we observed a direct physical association between DnaX and helicase, providing evidence for a functional interaction between the two proteins. Furthermore, we found that the presence of a specific small molecule inhibitor resulted in a significant reduction in the binding affinity between DnaX and helicase, suggesting a potential therapeutic strategy for inhibiting DNA replication in E. coli. Our findings shed light on the molecular mechanisms underlying the coordination of DNA replication machinery and provide insights into potential targets for the development of novel antimicrobial agents.
