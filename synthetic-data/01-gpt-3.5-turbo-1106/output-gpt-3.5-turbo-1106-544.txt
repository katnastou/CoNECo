prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: glycoprotein Ib-IX-V. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The glycoprotein Ib-IX-V (GPIb-IX-V) complex is a critical receptor involved in platelet adhesion and thrombosis. This multimeric complex is composed of four distinct subunits, glycoprotein Ibα, glycoprotein Ibβ, and glycoprotein IX, as well as the glycoprotein V co-receptor. Binding of von Willebrand factor (VWF) to the extracellular domain of GPIb-IX-V under high shear forces initiates platelet adhesion to the subendothelial matrix at sites of vascular injury. This crucial interaction is essential for maintaining hemostasis and preventing excessive bleeding. Dysregulation of the GPIb-IX-V complex has been associated with various bleeding disorders and thrombotic diseases, emphasizing its importance in maintaining hemostatic balance. Understanding the molecular mechanisms governing GPIb-IX-V function is essential for developing targeted therapies for thrombotic and bleeding disorders.
