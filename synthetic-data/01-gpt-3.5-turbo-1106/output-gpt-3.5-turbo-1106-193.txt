prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: MKS. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we investigated the role of the MKS protein complex in the pathogenesis of polycystic kidney disease (PKD) in a murine model. Our findings revealed a significant upregulation of MKS expression in the kidneys of PKD-afflicted mice compared to control counterparts. Furthermore, through a series of biochemical analyses, we elucidated the intricate interactions between MKS and various signaling molecules implicated in renal cystogenesis. Importantly, our results established a direct association between increased MKS activity and the abnormal proliferation of renal tubular epithelial cells, characteristic of PKD. These findings shed light on the potential therapeutic targeting of MKS as a novel strategy for mitigating the progression of PKD and offer new insights into the molecular mechanisms driving renal cyst formation.
