prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: IL-23. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In recent years, the IL-23 protein complex has garnered significant attention for its critical role in the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases such as psoriasis, rheumatoid arthritis, and Crohn's disease. IL-23 is known to play a pivotal role in the differentiation and expansion of Th17 cells, contributing to the sustained inflammation observed in these conditions. Several studies have highlighted the potential of targeting the IL-23 pathway for therapeutic interventions, with monoclonal antibodies against IL-23 showing promising results in clinical trials. However, further research is warranted to fully elucidate the complex interplay between IL-23, Th17 cells, and other inflammatory mediators, in order to develop more effective treatment strategies for autoimmune disorders.
