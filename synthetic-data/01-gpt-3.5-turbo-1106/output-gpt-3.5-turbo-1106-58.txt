prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: TCTC. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The TCTC protein complex has been implicated in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative disorders, including Alzheimer's disease. Recent studies have shown that the dysregulation of TCTC expression and activity correlates with increased neuroinflammation and the accumulation of amyloid-beta plaques in the brain. Additionally, the TCTC complex has been found to interact with specific chemical compounds, such as amyloid-beta oligomers, leading to enhanced neuronal toxicity and synaptic dysfunction. These findings highlight the potential of targeting the TCTC complex as a therapeutic strategy for mitigating neurodegenerative disease progression. Furthermore, the elucidation of the molecular mechanisms underlying the involvement of TCTC in neurodegeneration may provide valuable insights for the development of novel treatments for Alzheimer's disease and related disorders.
