prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: CGRP receptor. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The role of the CGRP receptor in migraine pathophysiology has been the subject of extensive investigation due to its potential as a therapeutic target for migraine treatment. Calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) is a neuropeptide implicated in migraine pathogenesis, and its binding to the CGRP receptor has been associated with the modulation of pain transmission. In preclinical studies, small molecule antagonists targeting the CGRP receptor have demonstrated efficacy in reducing migraine frequency and severity. The development of monoclonal antibodies against CGRP or its receptor has advanced to clinical trials and shown promising results in the prevention of migraine attacks. Therefore, targeting the CGRP receptor presents a potential avenue for the development of novel migraine therapies.
