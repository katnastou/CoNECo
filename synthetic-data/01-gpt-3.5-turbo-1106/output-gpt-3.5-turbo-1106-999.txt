prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: Rpd3S. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The Rpd3S protein complex has been implicated in the epigenetic regulation of gene expression in various eukaryotic organisms. Recent studies have demonstrated the critical involvement of Rpd3S in the repression of specific genes associated with developmental processes and cellular differentiation. Furthermore, dysregulation of Rpd3S has been linked to the pathogenesis of several diseases, notably certain types of cancer and neurodegenerative disorders. The intricate interplay between Rpd3S and chromatin modifying enzymes has emerged as a significant area of investigation, shedding light on the dynamic mechanisms underlying epigenetic control. These findings underscore the potential of targeting the Rpd3S complex for therapeutic interventions aimed at modulating transcriptional programs and mitigating disease progression.
