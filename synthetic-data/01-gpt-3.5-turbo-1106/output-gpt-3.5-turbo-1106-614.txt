prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: fumarate reductases. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: Fumarate reductases are key enzymes involved in the citric acid cycle, and their dysregulation has been implicated in various pathological processes. Recent studies have shown that the activity of fumarate reductases is upregulated in certain cancer cell lines, particularly in aggressive forms of renal cell carcinoma. Furthermore, investigation of fumarate reductases in bacterial pathogens has revealed their crucial role in anaerobic respiration and virulence. The potential of fumarate reductases as therapeutic targets for cancer and infectious diseases is therefore an area of active research and holds promise for the development of novel treatment strategies.
