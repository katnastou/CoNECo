prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: Complement 1q. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we investigated the role of Complement 1q (C1q) in the pathogenesis of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Our findings demonstrated a significant increase in C1q levels in the serum of SLE patients compared to healthy controls, indicating a potential correlation between C1q and SLE progression. Furthermore, our data revealed a positive association between C1q levels and disease severity, as measured by clinical indices and organ involvement. Interestingly, analysis of C1q in the context of SLE nephritis demonstrated a direct correlation with renal dysfunction. These results suggest that C1q may serve as a diagnostic and prognostic biomarker for SLE, providing valuable insights into the pathophysiology of the disease and the potential for targeted therapeutic interventions.
