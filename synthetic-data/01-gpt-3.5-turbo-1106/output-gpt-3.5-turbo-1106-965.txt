prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: GTPases. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: Recent studies have shed light on the critical role of GTPases in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease. GTPases are known to play a central role in cellular trafficking and signaling pathways, influencing processes like vesicle formation and intracellular transport. Dysregulation of GTPase activity has been implicated in the aberrant accumulation of amyloid-beta peptides and tau protein, the hallmark pathological factors in Alzheimer's disease. Furthermore, GTPases have been shown to interact with various downstream effectors, impacting neuronal survival and synaptic function. Understanding the intricate molecular mechanisms underlying GTPase-mediated pathways may provide new therapeutic targets for the treatment of neurodegenerative disorders.
