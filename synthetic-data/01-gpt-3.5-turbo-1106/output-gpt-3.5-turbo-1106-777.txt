prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: fatty acid synthetases. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: Fatty acid synthetases are key enzymes involved in the de novo biosynthesis of fatty acids in diverse organisms, including humans. Dysregulation of fatty acid synthetases has been implicated in various metabolic disorders, such as obesity, diabetes, and cardiovascular diseases. Recent studies have elucidated the intricate regulatory mechanisms governing the activity of fatty acid synthetases, including the impact of hormonal signaling pathways and cellular energy status. Furthermore, small molecule inhibitors targeting fatty acid synthetases have shown promise as potential therapeutic agents in the management of metabolic disorders. Understanding the molecular and biochemical properties of fatty acid synthetases is essential for the development of targeted interventions aimed at modulating lipid metabolism in health and disease.
