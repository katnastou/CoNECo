prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: succinate-CoA ligase. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: Succinate-CoA ligase is an essential enzyme for the tricarboxylic acid cycle, catalyzing the conversion of succinyl-CoA to succinate and ATP. Dysregulation of succinate-CoA ligase activity has been implicated in a variety of pathological conditions, including metabolic disorders and cancer. The dysregulation of this enzyme has been shown to disrupt cellular energy metabolism and contribute to tumor formation and progression. Additionally, mutations in the gene encoding succinate-CoA ligase have been identified in patients with hereditary disorders such as mitochondrial encephalomyopathy and other metabolic disorders. Understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying succinate-CoA ligase dysfunction may provide insights into the development of targeted therapies for these diseases.
