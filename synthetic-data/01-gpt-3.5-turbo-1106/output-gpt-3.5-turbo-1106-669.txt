prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: ammonium transmembrane transporters. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we investigate the role of the ammonium transmembrane transporters in the pathogenesis of renal tubular acidosis. Our findings reveal a potential involvement of these transporters in the dysregulation of ammonium ion homeostasis, leading to the development of metabolic acidosis. Through the use of a genetically modified mouse model with targeted disruption of the Ammonium Transmembrane Transporters gene, we observed a significant impairment in renal ammonium handling, accompanied by acid-base disturbances. Furthermore, pharmacological inhibition of the ammonium transmembrane transporters resulted in a similar phenotype, further supporting their crucial role in acid-base balance. These findings shed light on the potential therapeutic implications of targeting the ammonium transmembrane transporters in the management of renal tubular acidosis and related metabolic disorders.
