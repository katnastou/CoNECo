prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: SC5b-7. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The complement system is a crucial component of the host immune defense, contributing to the detection and elimination of foreign pathogens, as well as the removal of damaged cells and immune complexes. One of the key players in the complement cascade is the SC5b-7 protein complex, which plays a central role in the formation of the membrane attack complex (MAC) and subsequent lysis of target cells. Dysregulation of the complement system, including aberrant activation of SC5b-7, has been implicated in various pathological conditions, such as autoimmune diseases, inflammatory disorders, and sepsis. Therefore, understanding the mechanisms underlying the regulation of SC5b-7 and its interactions with other complement components is essential for the development of targeted therapeutic strategies for complement-related diseases.
