prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: Maturation promoting factors. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: This study investigated the role of Maturation promoting factors (MPFs) in the progression of oocyte maturation in Xenopus laevis. By utilizing chemical inhibitors targeting MPFs, we found that their inhibition led to a significant delay in oocyte maturation, indicating their pivotal role in this process. Furthermore, we observed increased levels of MPFs in oocytes from individuals with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), suggesting a potential connection between MPFs and the pathogenesis of this condition. Our findings provide valuable insights into the regulatory mechanisms of oocyte maturation and shed light on potential therapeutic targets for PCOS.
