prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: Glu-AdT. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The Glu-AdT protein complex has been identified as a crucial regulator of energy metabolism in metabolic syndrome, a complex disorder characterized by insulin resistance and dyslipidemia. The complex has been found to play a pivotal role in the regulation of glucose uptake and lipid metabolism in adipocytes, thereby influencing the development and progression of metabolic syndrome. Recent studies have also implicated the Glu-AdT complex in the pathogenesis of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), a common hepatic manifestation of metabolic syndrome. The complex's involvement in these metabolic pathways highlights its potential as a therapeutic target for the management of metabolic syndrome and related disorders. Further research into the molecular mechanisms underlying the function of the Glu-AdT complex may uncover new opportunities for the development of targeted interventions to address metabolic syndrome and its associated complications.
