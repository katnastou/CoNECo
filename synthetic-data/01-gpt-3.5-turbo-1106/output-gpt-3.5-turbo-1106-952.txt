prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: IgG immunoglobulins. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: IgG immunoglobulins are essential components of the humoral immune response. These glycoproteins play a crucial role in the opsonization of pathogens, neutralization of toxins, and activation of the complement system. Dysregulation of IgG immunoglobulins has been implicated in various autoimmune disorders, including systemic lupus erythematosus and rheumatoid arthritis. Furthermore, IgG immunoglobulins are often used as therapeutic agents for the treatment of immune deficiencies and certain inflammatory diseases. Understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying the function of IgG immunoglobulins is important for the development of targeted immunotherapies and the advancement of personalized medicine strategies.
