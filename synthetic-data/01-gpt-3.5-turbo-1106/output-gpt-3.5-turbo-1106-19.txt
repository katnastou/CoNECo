prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: TAP. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we investigated the role of the TAP protein complex in the regulation of antigen presentation in autoimmune diseases. Our research focused on the interaction between the TAP complex and specific peptide antigens in the context of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules. Using a combination of cellular assays and molecular modeling, we demonstrated the critical involvement of TAP in the transport of antigenic peptides into the endoplasmic reticulum for subsequent loading onto MHC class I molecules. Furthermore, we examined the impact of TAP dysregulation on the pathogenesis of autoimmune disorders, such as rheumatoid arthritis and type 1 diabetes, and observed a correlation between TAP dysfunction and aberrant immune responses. These findings provide novel insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying autoimmune pathology and offer potential therapeutic targets for the modulation of antigen presentation in autoimmune conditions.
