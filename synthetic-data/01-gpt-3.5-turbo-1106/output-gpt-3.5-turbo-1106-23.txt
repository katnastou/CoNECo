prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: CRL5. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The CRL5 protein complex has been associated with the pathogenesis of various types of cancer, including breast cancer and lung cancer. Studies have demonstrated that dysregulation of CRL5 can lead to aberrant cell proliferation and tumor growth. Furthermore, the interaction between CRL5 and the oncoprotein X has been shown to promote tumorigenesis by enhancing cell survival and inhibiting apoptosis. Targeting CRL5 may hold promise as a therapeutic strategy for the treatment of cancer. Additionally, further investigation into the molecular mechanisms underlying the role of CRL5 in cancer progression may provide valuable insights into potential therapeutic interventions for these malignancies.
