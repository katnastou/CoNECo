prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: dynein. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The dynein protein complex plays a crucial role in cellular transportation and organelle dynamics within eukaryotic cells. Previous studies have demonstrated the involvement of dynein in the intracellular transport of vesicles and organelles along microtubules. Recent research has implicated dynein dysfunction in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease and Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS). Additionally, the complex interplay between dynein and various motor proteins, including kinesin, has been shown to be essential for proper mitotic spindle assembly and chromosome segregation during cell division. Understanding the intricate regulatory mechanisms governing dynein activity has the potential to uncover novel therapeutic targets for treating diseases associated with defective intracellular transport.
