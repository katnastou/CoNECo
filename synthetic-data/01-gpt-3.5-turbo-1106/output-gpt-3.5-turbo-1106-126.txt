prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: VLDL particle. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In the present study, we investigated the role of the VLDL particle in atherosclerosis development. We utilized a murine model of hypercholesterolemia to examine the effects of VLDL particle size and composition on the progression of atherosclerotic plaques. Our findings demonstrate that larger VLDL particles, enriched in triglycerides and cholesterol esters, significantly promote the formation and growth of atherosclerotic lesions in the aorta. Additionally, we observed a positive correlation between VLDL particle size and the levels of inflammatory markers such as interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis factor-alpha. These results indicate that VLDL particle characteristics play a crucial role in atherosclerosis pathogenesis and suggest that interventions targeting VLDL particle composition may hold therapeutic potential for managing atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease.
