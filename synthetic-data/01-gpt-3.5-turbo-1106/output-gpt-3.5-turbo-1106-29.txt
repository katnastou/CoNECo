prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: Adenosylcobalamin-dependent ethanolamine ammonia-lyase. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: A key step in the metabolism of choline and ethanolamine is the conversion into acetaldehyde and ammonia by the adenosylcobalamin-dependent ethanolamine ammonia-lyase (EAL). This enzymatic process plays a crucial role in the homeostasis of cellular choline and ethanolamine metabolism, contributing to the synthesis of various important cellular components such as phospholipids and the neurotransmitter acetylcholine. Dysregulation of EAL activity has been implicated in conditions such as hepatic encephalopathy and fatty liver disease, highlighting the pivotal role of this enzyme in maintaining metabolic balance and overall health. Further research into the regulation and functional significance of EAL may provide insights into potential therapeutic targets for these and other related metabolic disorders.
