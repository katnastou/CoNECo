prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: translocase of the outer mitochondrial membranes. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The translocase of the outer mitochondrial membranes (TOM) is a crucial protein complex involved in the import of nuclear-encoded proteins into mitochondria, supporting the maintenance of mitochondrial function and homeostasis. Dysfunction of TOM has been associated with various human diseases, including neurodegenerative disorders such as Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease. Recent studies have identified a potential role of TOM in the regulation of mitochondrial dynamics and morphology, highlighting its significance beyond protein import. Furthermore, the identification of small molecules targeting TOM holds promise for the development of therapeutic interventions for diseases associated with mitochondrial dysfunction. Understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying the function and regulation of TOM is essential for advancing therapeutic strategies aimed at mitigating mitochondrial-related pathologies.
