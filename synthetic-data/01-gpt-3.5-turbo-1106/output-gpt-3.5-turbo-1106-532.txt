prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: glutamine amidotransferase II. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The glutamine amidotransferase II (GAT II) protein complex plays a critical role in the biosynthesis of purine nucleotides, exhibiting catalytic activity in the conversion of glutamine and phosphoribosylpyrophosphate (PRPP) to 5-phospho-Î²-D-ribosylamine (PRA) and pyrophosphate. Dysregulation of the GAT II complex has been implicated in the pathogenesis of various hematologic malignancies, such as acute lymphoblastic leukemia and acute myeloid leukemia. Furthermore, investigations have revealed potential therapeutic targets within the GAT II pathway for the development of novel treatment strategies. The identification of small molecule inhibitors of GAT II activity may offer new avenues for intervention in purine nucleotide metabolism, with potential clinical impact on these malignancies.
