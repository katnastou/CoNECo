prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: aminophospholipid translocase. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: Recent studies have yielded important insights into the regulation and function of the aminophospholipid translocase (APLT) in mammalian cells. APTL is essential for maintaining proper membrane asymmetry and dysregulation of its activity has been implicated in various pathological conditions, including cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, and infectious diseases. The interaction between APTL and lipid molecules, such as phosphatidylserine, has been shown to play a key role in mediating cellular processes, such as phagocytosis and apoptosis. Furthermore, emerging evidence suggests that APTL activity may also impact the efficacy of certain chemotherapeutic agents and influence the pathogenesis of specific viral infections. These findings underscore the potential of APTL as a therapeutic target for treating a range of human diseases. Further research aiming to elucidate the precise mechanisms underlying APTL function and regulation is warranted and may pave the way for the development of novel therapeutic approaches.
