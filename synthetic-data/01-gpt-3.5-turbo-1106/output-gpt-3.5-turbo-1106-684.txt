prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: ClpYQ proteases. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we investigated the potential therapeutic effects of targeting the ClpYQ proteases in the context of neurodegenerative diseases. Previous studies have demonstrated the critical role of these proteases in protein quality control and cellular homeostasis. We examined the impact of small molecule inhibitors on the activity and stability of ClpYQ proteases in models of neurodegeneration, including Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease. Our findings revealed that inhibition of ClpYQ proteases led to a reduction in the accumulation of misfolded proteins associated with these neurodegenerative conditions. Moreover, treatment with these inhibitors resulted in a significant improvement in neuronal survival and function in vitro and in animal models. These results provide valuable insights into the therapeutic potential of targeting ClpYQ proteases for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases.
