prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: N-terminal acetyltransferase B. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we investigate the role of the N-terminal acetyltransferase B (NatB) complex in the context of liver regeneration. We utilized a mouse model of partial hepatectomy to elucidate the impact of NatB on the proliferation and regeneration of hepatocytes. Our findings reveal that NatB deficiency leads to a delayed and impaired response to liver injury, characterized by reduced hepatocyte proliferation and increased hepatocellular apoptosis. Furthermore, we identified dysregulation of key signaling pathways related to cell cycle progression and DNA damage response in NatB-deficient livers. These results shed light on a novel function of NatB in liver regeneration, underscoring its potential as a therapeutic target for liver diseases characterized by impaired regenerative capacity.
