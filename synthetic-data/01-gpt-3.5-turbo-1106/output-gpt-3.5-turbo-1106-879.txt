prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: cytosolic proteasome. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The cytosolic proteasome is a crucial component of the intracellular protein degradation machinery in eukaryotic cells. It plays a pivotal role in maintaining cellular homeostasis by degrading misfolded or damaged proteins, as well as regulating the levels of key signaling molecules involved in various cellular processes. Dysregulation of the cytosolic proteasome has been linked to the pathogenesis of several diseases, including cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, and autoimmune conditions. Therefore, understanding the structure and function of the cytosolic proteasome is of great significance for the development of targeted therapies aimed at modulating its activity in the context of human health and disease.
