prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: GABA receptors. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The GABA receptors are integral components of the central nervous system, playing a crucial role in regulating inhibitory synaptic transmission. Deficiencies or dysfunctions in GABA receptors have been implicated in a spectrum of neurological disorders, including anxiety, epilepsy, and Parkinson's disease. Given their pivotal role in modulating neuronal excitability, GABA receptors represent an appealing target for pharmacological interventions aimed at ameliorating these pathological conditions. Numerous studies have explored the potential therapeutic effects of GABA receptor agonists and positive allosteric modulators in mitigating symptoms associated with these neurological disorders. Further investigation into the intricate mechanisms governing GABA receptor function and regulation may pave the way for the development of novel therapeutic strategies to address these challenging neurological conditions.
