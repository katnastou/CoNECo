prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: ESCRT III. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The ESCRT III complex has been demonstrated to play a pivotal role in the cellular process of multivesicular body (MVB) formation and regulation of the endosomal system. Recent studies have implicated the involvement of ESCRT III in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease, as well as certain viral infections. It has been shown that malfunctioning of ESCRT III can lead to aberrant protein aggregation and impaired protein degradation pathways, contributing to the accumulation of toxic protein species. Given its central role in cellular homeostasis, the ESCRT III complex represents an attractive target for therapeutic interventions aimed at mitigating the progression of neurodegenerative diseases and viral infections. Further elucidation of the molecular mechanisms underlying ESCRT III function holds promise for the development of novel pharmacological strategies to combat these debilitating conditions.
