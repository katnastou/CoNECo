prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: gamma-glutamylcysteine synthetase. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we investigated the effects of N-acetylcysteine (NAC) on the expression and activity of the gamma-glutamylcysteine synthetase (GCS) complex in a murine model of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Our results demonstrated a significant upregulation of GCS expression and enzymatic activity in the liver tissues of mice treated with NAC compared to untreated control animals. Furthermore, we observed a concomitant reduction in hepatic oxidative stress markers and improved liver function in the NAC-treated group. Our findings suggest that NAC may exert its hepatoprotective effects, at least in part, by modulating the GCS complex, leading to enhanced glutathione biosynthesis and antioxidant capacity in the context of NAFLD. These results warrant further investigation into the therapeutic potential of NAC in the management of liver diseases associated with oxidative stress and impaired GCS function.
