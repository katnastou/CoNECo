prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: HAUS. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The HAUS (HAUS Augmin-like complex) protein complex has been found to play a critical role in the regulation of microtubule network assembly, which is fundamental for various cellular processes including mitosis and intracellular transport. Recent studies have implicated HAUS in the pathogenesis of certain neurodegenerative diseases, such as Parkinson's disease, where dysregulation of the microtubule network has been observed. Furthermore, small molecule inhibitors targeting components of the HAUS complex have shown promise in inhibiting cancer cell growth and metastasis, suggesting a potential therapeutic strategy for cancer treatment. Understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying HAUS complex function may provide valuable insights for the development of novel therapeutic interventions for diseases characterized by disrupted microtubule dynamics.
