prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: exosome. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The exosome is a highly conserved multi-subunit complex involved in RNA processing and turnover in eukaryotic cells. Recent studies have shown that the exosome plays a crucial role in regulating the degradation and processing of various classes of RNA, including messenger RNA, ribosomal RNA, and transfer RNA. Dysregulation of exosome complex activity has been implicated in several human diseases, including neurodegenerative disorders and cancer. Furthermore, the exosome has been identified as a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of certain viral infections, such as hepatitis C. Understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying exosome function and its implications in disease pathogenesis may pave the way for the development of novel therapeutic interventions.
