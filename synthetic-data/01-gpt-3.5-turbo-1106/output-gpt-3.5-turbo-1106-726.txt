prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: glycine synthase. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: Recent studies have demonstrated the critical role of the glycine synthase complex in various biological processes. This complex is responsible for the conversion of serine and thylene tetrahydrofolate into glycine, a fundamental component in the synthesis of proteins, nucleic acids, and other essential biomolecules. Dysregulation of the glycine synthase complex has been implicated in several pathological conditions, including neurological disorders and certain types of cancer. Furthermore, the therapeutic potential of modulating the activity of this complex in the treatment of these diseases is currently under investigation. Understanding the intricate regulatory mechanisms and functional significance of the glycine synthase complex holds great promise for the development of novel targeted therapies for a range of human diseases.
