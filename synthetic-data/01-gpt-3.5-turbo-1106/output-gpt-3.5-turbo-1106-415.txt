prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: transport protein particle. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we investigated the role of the transport protein particle in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease. We analyzed post-mortem brain tissue samples from Alzheimer's disease patients and non-diseased control individuals to assess the expression levels of the transport protein particle. Our findings revealed a significant upregulation of the transport protein particle in the hippocampus and frontal cortex of Alzheimer's disease brains compared to controls. Furthermore, we observed co-localization of the transport protein particle with amyloid beta plaques, suggesting a potential association with disease pathology. These results provide new insights into the involvement of the transport protein particle in the pathophysiology of Alzheimer's disease, presenting a potential target for future therapeutic interventions.
