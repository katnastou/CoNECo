prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: serine-pyruvate aminotransferase. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we aimed to investigate the role of serine-pyruvate aminotransferase in the development of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) in a murine model. Our results demonstrate a significant upregulation of serine-pyruvate aminotransferase activity in the liver tissue of NAFLD-induced mice compared to controls. Furthermore, we observed a positive correlation between serine-pyruvate aminotransferase activity and hepatic triglyceride levels, suggesting a potential association between the enzyme and NAFLD pathology. Additionally, our findings indicate that pharmacological inhibition of serine-pyruvate aminotransferase attenuated hepatic lipid accumulation and reduced markers of liver inflammation in the NAFLD model, highlighting serine-pyruvate aminotransferase as a promising target for therapeutic intervention in NAFLD.
