prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: GPI-GnT. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The GPI-GnT protein complex, which is involved in the biosynthesis of glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchors, has been the subject of significant investigation due to its connection to various genetic disorders. Studies have shown that knockdown of the GPI-GnT complex in animal models leads to abnormal development and neurological phenotypes reminiscent of inherited GPI deficiencies in humans. Additionally, aberrant expression of the GPI-GnT complex has been linked to the pathogenesis of certain neurodevelopmental disorders, such as epilepsy and intellectual disability. Furthermore, dysregulation of GPI-GnT has been implicated in the progression of certain cancers, highlighting the diverse roles of this protein complex in both physiological and pathological processes. Understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying the function of GPI-GnT may offer valuable insights into the development of targeted therapies for a range of genetic and neurological disorders.
