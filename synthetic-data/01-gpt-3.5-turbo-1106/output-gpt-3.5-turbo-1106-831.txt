prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: ACCase. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: Inhibition of acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACCase), a key enzyme in fatty acid biosynthesis, has been recognized as a promising therapeutic approach for managing hyperlipidemia and related metabolic disorders. Recently, several small-molecule inhibitors targeting ACCase have been identified to possess potent antidyslipidemic and anti-obesity effects in preclinical studies. In this context, the inhibitory activities of these compounds against ACCase were evaluated in vitro, showing micromolar range potency with minimal off-target effects. Furthermore, in rodent models of hyperlipidemia, oral administration of these ACCase inhibitors led to a significant reduction in plasma triglyceride levels as well as improvement in hepatic steatosis. Collectively, these findings underscore the potential of ACCase as a druggable target for the development of novel therapeutics to combat dyslipidemia and related metabolic disorders.
