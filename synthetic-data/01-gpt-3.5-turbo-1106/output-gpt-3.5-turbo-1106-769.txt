prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: CD42. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: A recent study investigated the role of the CD42 protein complex in the pathogenesis of thrombotic disorders. The study utilized a murine model of thrombosis and found that genetic deletion of the CD42 complex led to a significant reduction in thrombus formation, indicating a crucial role of this complex in the initiation and propagation of thrombosis. Further analysis revealed that CD42 complex-deficient mice exhibited decreased platelet activation and aggregation, highlighting the importance of this complex in platelet function. Additionally, the study identified potential therapeutic targets for modulating CD42 complex activity to prevent thrombotic events in individuals predisposed to thrombosis, offering potential avenues for the development of novel antithrombotic agents. These findings provide valuable insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying thrombosis and may have significant implications for the development of targeted therapeutic interventions for thrombotic disorders.
