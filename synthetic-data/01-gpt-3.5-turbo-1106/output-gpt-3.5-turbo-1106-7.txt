prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: ProVWX. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we investigated the cellular role of the ProVWX protein complex in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease. Using a genetically engineered mouse model, we demonstrated that loss of function mutations in the ProVWX complex led to altered dopamine metabolism and neuronal dysfunction, resembling key features of Parkinson's disease. Furthermore, our analyses revealed that the ProVWX complex interacts with components of the mitochondrial respiratory chain, suggesting a potential link between ProVWX and mitochondrial dysfunction in the context of Parkinson's disease. These findings shed light on the complex interplay between ProVWX and neurodegenerative processes, highlighting a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of Parkinson's disease.
