prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: mammalian spliceosomal complex E. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The mammalian spliceosomal complex E is a critical component of the splicing machinery, which is essential for the removal of introns from pre-mRNA in eukaryotic cells. Recent studies have suggested that dysregulation of mammalian spliceosomal complex E may contribute to the pathogenesis of various diseases, including neurodegenerative disorders and certain cancers. The function of this complex is tightly regulated by a network of RNA-binding proteins, small nuclear RNAs, and other auxiliary factors. Dysfunctional mammalian spliceosomal complex E has been implicated in aberrant mRNA splicing, leading to the production of abnormal protein isoforms that can drive disease progression. Understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying the assembly and activity of mammalian spliceosomal complex E holds great promise in the development of targeted therapies for these devastating conditions.
