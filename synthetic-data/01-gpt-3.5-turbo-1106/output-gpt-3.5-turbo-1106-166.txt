prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we aimed to investigate the role of the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter in the development of multidrug resistance in breast cancer. We utilized a series of in vitro experiments to assess the impact of ABC transporter overexpression on the efflux of chemotherapeutic agents such as doxorubicin and paclitaxel. Our results demonstrate a positive correlation between ABC transporter expression levels and the reduced intracellular accumulation of these drugs, leading to decreased chemosensitivity in breast cancer cell lines. Furthermore, through gene silencing techniques, we established a direct link between ABC transporter activity and the development of drug resistance. This finding highlights the potential of targeting ABC transporters as a novel approach to overcome multidrug resistance in breast cancer, thus improving the efficacy of chemotherapy in this patient population.
