prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: MAT. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: Our study aimed to investigate the role of the MAT protein complex in the pathogenesis of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). We conducted experiments using a murine model of NAFLD and observed a significant upregulation of MAT complex expression in the livers of diseased mice compared to healthy controls. Furthermore, we found a correlation between serum levels of liver enzymes and MAT complex expression, suggesting a potential role for MAT complex in liver injury. Treatment with a small molecule inhibitor targeting MAT complex led to a reduction in hepatic steatosis and inflammation in NAFLD mice. These findings highlight the potential for targeting the MAT complex as a therapeutic strategy for NAFLD. Our study provides novel insights into the involvement of the MAT complex in NAFLD pathogenesis and supports further investigation of MAT complex as a potential therapeutic target for this prevalent metabolic disorder.
