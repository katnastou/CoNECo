prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: type I interferon receptors. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The type I interferon receptors play a vital role in the innate immune response to viral infections. Binding of type I interferons to their receptor complex triggers a cascade of signaling events leading to the induction of interferon-stimulated genes, which are essential for mounting an antiviral defense. Dysregulation of the type I interferon receptor signaling pathway has been implicated in a variety of autoimmune disorders, including systemic lupus erythematosus and Sj√∂gren's syndrome. Understanding the molecular mechanisms governing the activation and regulation of type I interferon receptors holds great promise for the development of targeted therapeutic interventions for these debilitating conditions.
