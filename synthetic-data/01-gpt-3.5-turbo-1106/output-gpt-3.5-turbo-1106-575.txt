prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: FO-synthases. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In recent years, the role of FO-synthases in the regulation of mitochondrial function has garnered significant attention in the field of biochemistry and cell biology. FO-synthases are integral to the synthesis of ATP, the primary energy currency in living organisms, and their dysfunction has been associated with various metabolic disorders, including mitochondrial diseases and neurodegenerative conditions. Furthermore, studies have shown that the activity of FO-synthases is modulated by specific chemical compounds, such as coenzyme Q10, which could have implications for the development of targeted therapies for mitochondrial dysfunction-related diseases. Understanding the intricate interplay between FO-synthases and their regulatory factors holds great promise for advancing our knowledge of cellular bioenergetics and exploring potential avenues for therapeutic interventions.
