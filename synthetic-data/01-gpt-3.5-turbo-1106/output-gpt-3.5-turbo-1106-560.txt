prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: YSiR. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The YSiR protein complex has been recognized as a critical regulator of lipid metabolism in various organisms. Recent studies have proposed that YSiR plays a key role in the development of metabolic disorders, including obesity and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Moreover, its interaction with specific chemical entities, such as insulin and free fatty acids, suggests a potential link between YSiR dysregulation and the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes. Furthermore, investigations into the effect of YSiR in animal models have revealed its involvement in the regulation of inflammatory responses and its potential association with atherosclerosis. These findings underscore the significance of YSiR in the maintenance of metabolic homeostasis and provide valuable insights into its potential as a therapeutic target for metabolic disorders.
