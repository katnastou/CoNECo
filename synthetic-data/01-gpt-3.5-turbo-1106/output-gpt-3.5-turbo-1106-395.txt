prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: glycine decarboxylases. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In recent years, there has been a growing interest in understanding the role of glycine decarboxylases in various disease processes. Glycine decarboxylases are known to be key enzymes involved in the glycine cleavage system, which plays a critical role in cellular metabolism. Several studies have linked dysregulation of glycine decarboxylases to metabolic disorders such as hyperglycinemia and nonketotic hyperglycinemia. Additionally, emerging evidence suggests a potential link between glycine decarboxylases and certain types of cancer, highlighting the importance of further exploring the molecular mechanisms underlying their involvement in disease. It is clear that a deeper understanding of the function and regulation of glycine decarboxylases may hold great promise for the development of novel therapeutic strategies for a range of human diseases.
