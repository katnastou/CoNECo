prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: MCM core. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: An essential process in eukaryotic cell replication is the assembly and activation of the MCM core complex, a key component in DNA replication initiation. Recent studies have revealed the interaction of the MCM core with various regulatory factors, including cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) and inhibitor of CDK4 (INK4), suggesting its involvement in cell cycle regulation. Dysregulation of the MCM core complex has been implicated in various human diseases, such as certain carcinomas and developmental disorders. Understanding the molecular mechanisms governing the MCM core complex assembly and function may provide valuable insights into disease pathogenesis and potential therapeutic interventions. Further investigations into the precise regulatory mechanisms of the MCM core are essential for elucidating its role in cellular homeostasis and disease progression.
