prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: alphav-beta3 integrin. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The role of the alphav-beta3 integrin protein complex in cancer metastasis has been of great interest in recent years. Studies have shown that this protein complex plays a critical role in facilitating tumor cell migration and invasion. Inhibition of the alphav-beta3 integrin has emerged as a promising therapeutic strategy for preventing the spread of various cancers, including breast cancer, melanoma, and prostate cancer. Furthermore, the interaction of alphav-beta3 integrin with specific ligands, such as fibronectin and vitronectin, has been implicated in promoting angiogenesis and tumor growth. Targeting the alphav-beta3 integrin holds significant potential for the development of novel anti-cancer therapies and warrants further investigation.
