prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: mitochondrial small ribosomal subunit. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we investigated the role of the mitochondrial small ribosomal subunit in the pathogenesis of Mitochondrial Encephalomyopathy with Lactic Acidosis and Stroke-like episodes (MELAS) syndrome. Our findings demonstrate that mutations in the genes encoding the mitochondrial small ribosomal subunit are associated with the dysregulation of mitochondrial protein synthesis, ultimately leading to the impairment of oxidative phosphorylation and the accumulation of lactic acid in affected tissues. Furthermore, our results suggest that the mitochondrial small ribosomal subunit may serve as a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of MELAS syndrome by modulating mitochondrial protein translation. This elucidates a potential avenue for the development of novel interventions aimed at ameliorating the clinical manifestations of this debilitating mitochondrial disorder.
