prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: shelterins. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The shelterins are a critical protein complex involved in maintaining the structural and functional integrity of telomeres, which are essential for genomic stability. Dysregulation of shelterins has been implicated in various human diseases, including cancer and aging-related disorders. Recent studies have highlighted the role of certain chemical compounds in modulating the activity of shelterins, offering potential therapeutic avenues for targeting telomere maintenance pathways. Furthermore, investigations into the interplay between shelterins and specific organisms, such as viruses, have provided insights into the broader implications of shelterin dysregulation in viral pathogenesis. Understanding the intricate interconnections between shelterins and various biological processes holds promise for the development of novel interventions for diseases associated with aberrant telomere regulation.
