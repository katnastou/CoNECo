prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: C-P lyase. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The role of C-P lyase in the metabolism of phosphonates has been well documented in various organisms, including certain bacteria and algae. Phosphonates are organic compounds that contain a phosphorus-carbon bond, and they are important reservoirs of phosphorus in aquatic ecosystems. The enzymatic activity of C-P lyase is crucial for the utilization of phosphonates as a source of phosphorus by these organisms. Furthermore, the potential applications of C-P lyase in bioremediation and wastewater treatment have garnered interest due to its ability to degrade environmental pollutants such as phosphonate-based herbicides and antibiotics. Understanding the molecular mechanisms and regulatory pathways of C-P lyase may provide valuable insights for the development of novel strategies for environmental and agricultural management.
