prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: KFRC. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In recent years, the exploration of protein complexes has provided valuable insights into the molecular basis of various diseases. The KFRC complex, comprised of distinct subunits, has garnered significant attention due to its involvement in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative disorders. Through interaction studies, it has been revealed that the KFRC complex plays a crucial role in the regulation of intracellular signaling pathways associated with neuronal cell function and survival. Furthermore, dysregulation of KFRC has been linked to the progression of neurodegenerative conditions, making it a promising target for therapeutic intervention. Understanding the precise molecular mechanisms underlying the function and dysfunction of the KFRC complex holds great promise for the development of novel treatments aimed at mitigating the devastating impact of neurodegenerative diseases.
