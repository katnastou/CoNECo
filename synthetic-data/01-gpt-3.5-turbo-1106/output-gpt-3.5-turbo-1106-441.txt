prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: pore-forming toxin. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we investigated the interaction between the pore-forming toxin and lipid membranes. Our experiments revealed that the pore-forming toxin efficiently bound to the lipid membrane, leading to the formation of pores and disruption of membrane integrity. Furthermore, we found that the presence of cholesterol in the membrane influenced the binding and pore-forming ability of the toxin, indicating a potential role for cholesterol in modulating the activity of the pore-forming toxin. Our findings suggest a novel mechanism by which the pore-forming toxin interacts with lipid membranes, shedding light on its potential role in cellular injury and disease pathology. Understanding the complex interplay between the pore-forming toxin and lipid membranes may provide valuable insights into the development of new therapeutic strategies targeting toxin-induced membrane damage.
