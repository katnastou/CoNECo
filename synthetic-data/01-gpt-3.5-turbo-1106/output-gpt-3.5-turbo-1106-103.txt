prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: DNA methyltransferases. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs) are a family of enzymes crucial for the establishment and maintenance of DNA methylation patterns in mammals. Dysregulation of DNMTs has been linked to various human diseases, including cancer, neurodevelopmental disorders, and aging-related conditions. Research has focused on understanding the complex interplay between DNMTs and their co-factors, as well as exploring potential therapeutic interventions targeting aberrant DNA methylation. Investigations into the molecular mechanisms underlying DNMT activity and the impact of environmental factors on DNMT expression are ongoing, with the goal of uncovering new avenues for disease treatment and prevention.
