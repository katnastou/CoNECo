prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: cyclic-nucleotide phosphodiesterases. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: A growing body of evidence suggests a crucial role for cyclic-nucleotide phosphodiesterases (PDEs) in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular diseases. PDEs are a family of enzymes that modulate the intracellular levels of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) and cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP), which are critical second messengers in numerous cellular signaling pathways. Dysregulated PDE activity has been implicated in the pathogenesis of conditions such as heart failure, pulmonary arterial hypertension, and atherosclerosis. Consequently, PDE inhibitors have emerged as promising therapeutic agents in the management of these diseases. Despite the progress made in understanding the function of PDEs, further investigation is warranted to unravel the intricacies of their involvement in cardiovascular pathology and to develop more effective PDE-targeted therapies.
