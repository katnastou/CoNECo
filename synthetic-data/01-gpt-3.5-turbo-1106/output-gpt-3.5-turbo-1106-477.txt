prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: skeletal muscle L-type voltage-gated calcium channels. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: Recent studies have implicated the skeletal muscle L-type voltage-gated calcium channels (CaV1.1) in the pathophysiology of skeletal muscle diseases such as muscular dystrophy. Dysregulation of the calcium influx through these channels has been linked to impaired muscle function and contractility. Pharmacological modulation of these channels has emerged as a potential therapeutic avenue for treating skeletal muscle disorders. Furthermore, the interactions between CaV1.1 and auxiliary subunits, such as α2-δ and β, play a crucial role in regulating channel activity, suggesting that targeting these interactions may offer valuable strategies for developing novel therapeutics. Understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying the function and regulation of skeletal muscle L-type voltage-gated calcium channels has significant implications for the development of targeted therapies aimed at alleviating the burden of skeletal muscle diseases.
