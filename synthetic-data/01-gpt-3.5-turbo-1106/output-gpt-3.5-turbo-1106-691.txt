prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: Hydrogenase-1. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The role of the Hydrogenase-1 protein complex in hydrogen metabolism has been the subject of extensive investigation in various organisms. Studies have reported the involvement of the Hydrogenase-1 complex in catalyzing the reversible oxidation of molecular hydrogen, a key step in microbial hydrogen utilization. Furthermore, the genetic manipulation of organisms reliant on hydrogen metabolism has provided valuable insight into the regulatory mechanisms governing the expression and activity of the Hydrogenase-1 complex. Given the potential of hydrogen as a clean energy source, understanding the biochemical and physiological properties of the Hydrogenase-1 complex holds significant promise for the development of biotechnological applications and environmental remediation strategies.
