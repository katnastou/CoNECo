prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: IL-18 receptor. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we investigated the role of the IL-18 receptor in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Our findings demonstrate a significant upregulation of IL-18 receptor expression in the colonic mucosa of IBD patients compared to healthy controls. Furthermore, we observed a positive correlation between IL-18 receptor expression and disease severity, as determined by clinical and histological parameters. Using an animal model of IBD, we showed that blockade of the IL-18 receptor with a specific monoclonal antibody ameliorated colitis symptoms and reduced pro-inflammatory cytokine levels in the gut. These results suggest that targeting the IL-18 receptor may offer a promising therapeutic strategy for the management of IBD.
