prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: SOSS. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The SOSS (Sensor of Single-Stranded DNA) complex is a critical component in cellular DNA damage response pathways. Previous studies have revealed the essential role of SOSS in the recruitment and activation of the ATR kinase in response to single-stranded DNA breaks. Dysregulation of SOSS has been linked to increased genomic instability and cancer susceptibility in mammalian cells. In addition, studies in Drosophila have demonstrated the conserved function of SOSS in maintaining genome stability. Further investigation into the mechanisms underlying the assembly and regulation of the SOSS complex will provide valuable insights into its potential as a therapeutic target for cancer treatment and other diseases associated with DNA damage.
