model: gpt-3.5-turbo-1106
prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: gamma-tubulin small. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The role of the gamma-tubulin small (γ-TuSC) complex in microtubule nucleation has gained significant attention in the field of cellular biology. Recent studies have indicated that the γ-TuSC complex not only plays a crucial role in the organization and formation of microtubules, but also contributes to the maintenance of cellular structure and integrity. Dysregulation of γ-TuSC has been associated with a variety of human diseases, including neurodegenerative disorders and certain types of cancer. Furthermore, the identification of small molecule modulators targeting γ-TuSC has opened up new possibilities for therapeutic interventions in diseases characterized by aberrant microtubule dynamics. Overall, the growing body of evidence underscores the importance of understanding the functional roles and regulatory mechanisms of the γ-TuSC complex in cellular physiology and disease pathology.
