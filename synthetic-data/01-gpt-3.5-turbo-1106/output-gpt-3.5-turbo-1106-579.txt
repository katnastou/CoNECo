prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: AMPA receptor. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we investigated the role of the AMPA receptor in synaptic plasticity in a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease. We demonstrated that chronic administration of a targeted small molecule inhibitor of the AMPA receptor resulted in a significant improvement in cognitive function, as assessed by novel object recognition and Morris water maze tests. Furthermore, we found evidence that the modulation of AMPA receptor activity led to a reduction in amyloid-beta plaque deposition and neuroinflammation in the brains of treated animals. Our findings suggest that targeting the AMPA receptor may hold promise as a therapeutic strategy for ameliorating cognitive and pathological deficits in Alzheimer's disease.
