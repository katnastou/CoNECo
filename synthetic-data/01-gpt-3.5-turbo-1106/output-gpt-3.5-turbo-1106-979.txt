prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: proteasome cores. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The proteasome cores have been shown to play a crucial role in the regulation of protein degradation in various organisms, including Homo sapiens. Dysregulation of the proteasome cores has been linked to a number of diseases, such as cancer and neurodegenerative disorders. Recent studies have highlighted the potential of small molecule inhibitors targeting the proteasome cores as promising therapeutic agents for the treatment of these diseases. Additionally, the identification of endogenous modulators of the proteasome cores may provide novel insights into the physiological regulation of protein turnover and offer new avenues for therapeutic intervention. These findings underscore the importance of understanding the molecular mechanisms governing the function of the proteasome cores in health and disease.
