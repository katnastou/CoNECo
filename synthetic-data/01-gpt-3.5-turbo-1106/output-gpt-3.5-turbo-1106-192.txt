prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: aminodeoxychorismate synthase. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: We investigated the role of the aminodeoxychorismate synthase protein complex in the context of microbial infection. Our study focused on the interaction between the protein complex and a specific strain of bacteria known to cause severe respiratory illness. We found that the absence of the aminodeoxychorismate synthase protein complex resulted in a significant decrease in the host's ability to mount an effective immune response against the bacterial infection. Furthermore, we observed a marked increase in the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines in the absence of the protein complex, leading to heightened lung inflammation and tissue damage. Our findings shed light on the crucial role of the aminodeoxychorismate synthase protein complex in the host defense against bacterial infections and provide insight into potential therapeutic targets for respiratory diseases.
