prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: eNoSc. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The role of the eNoSc protein complex in cardiovascular health has been the subject of extensive investigation. Studies have revealed that eNoSc plays a crucial role in regulating endothelial function and vascular tone through its interactions with nitric oxide. Dysregulation of eNoSc has been implicated in the pathogenesis of several cardiovascular diseases, including hypertension and atherosclerosis. Furthermore, recent research has demonstrated the potential of targeting eNoSc for therapeutic intervention in these conditions. Understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying the function of eNoSc in vascular homeostasis is essential for developing novel strategies to treat and prevent cardiovascular disorders.
