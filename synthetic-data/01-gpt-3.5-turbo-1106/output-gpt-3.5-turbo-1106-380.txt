prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: GT-AG spliceosome. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The GT-AG spliceosome is a critical molecular machine involved in the process of pre-mRNA splicing, essential for the generation of mature messenger RNAs (mRNAs) in eukaryotic cells. Dysregulation of the GT-AG spliceosome has been linked to a variety of human diseases, including various neurodegenerative disorders and certain types of cancer. Recent studies have identified small molecule inhibitors that target specific components of the GT-AG spliceosome, offering potential therapeutic avenues for diseases associated with splicing defects. Furthermore, investigations into the molecular mechanisms governing the assembly and activity of the GT-AG spliceosome have revealed intricate interplay between various RNA-binding proteins and non-coding RNAs, shedding light on the complex regulatory networks underlying splicing events. This research provides valuable insights into the role of the GT-AG spliceosome in disease pathogenesis and offers potential strategies for therapeutic intervention.
