model: gpt-3.5-turbo-1106
prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: CenH3 containing nucleosome. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The role of the CenH3 containing nucleosome in centromere function has been extensively studied in various model organisms. The CenH3 containing nucleosome has been shown to play a crucial role in ensuring proper chromosome segregation during cell division. Dysregulation of the CenH3 containing nucleosome has been associated with chromosome instability and aneuploidy, contributing to the development of various genetic diseases and cancers. Understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying the assembly and regulation of the CenH3 containing nucleosome is critical for elucidating its functional significance and potential implications for human health. Furthermore, targeting the CenH3 containing nucleosome may hold therapeutic promise for the treatment of centromere-related disorders and cancer.
