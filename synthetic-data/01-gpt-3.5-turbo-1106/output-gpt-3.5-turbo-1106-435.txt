prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: Integration host factors. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: Integration host factors (IHF) are DNA-binding proteins that play a crucial role in the regulation of gene expression and DNA structure in a diverse range of bacteria. The IHF complex is essential for the integration and excision of foreign DNA elements, such as prophages and other horizontally transferred genetic elements, into the host genome. Recent studies have implicated IHF in the pathogenicity of certain bacteria, including its involvement in the regulation of virulence factors and bacterial biofilm formation. Furthermore, the interaction of IHF with other regulatory proteins and DNA sequences is integral to the maintenance of bacterial genome stability and adaptation to environmental stress. Understanding the mechanisms and pathways by which IHF influences bacterial physiology and pathogenesis may offer new insights into the development of therapeutic strategies targeting bacterial infections.
