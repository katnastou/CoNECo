prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: Enoyl CoA hydratase/isomerase. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The Enoyl CoA hydratase/isomerase complex has been the subject of extensive research due to its essential role in fatty acid metabolism. Previous studies have demonstrated the crucial function of this complex in the conversion of Enoyl CoA to β-hydroxyacyl CoA, a vital step in the β-oxidation of fatty acids. The dysregulation of this complex has been implicated in various metabolic disorders, including inherited metabolic syndromes and fatty acid oxidation disorders. Moreover, recent investigations have identified potential therapeutic targets for modulating the activity of the Enoyl CoA hydratase/isomerase complex in the treatment of these disorders. Understanding the precise mechanisms underlying the function and regulation of this complex holds significant promise for the development of targeted therapies for metabolic diseases.
