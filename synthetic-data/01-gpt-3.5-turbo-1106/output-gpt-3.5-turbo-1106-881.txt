prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: bacterial degradosome. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The bacterial degradosome is a multi-enzyme complex that plays a crucial role in RNA metabolism and degradation in bacteria. Recent studies have revealed that the bacterial degradosome is composed of several key components, including the RNase E, PNPase, and RhlB helicase. This complex has been shown to be essential for the processing and turnover of RNA molecules, and its dysfunction has been associated with various bacterial pathogenicity mechanisms and antibiotic resistance. Understanding the structural and functional properties of the bacterial degradosome is important for developing novel antibacterial strategies and therapeutic interventions against infectious diseases.
