prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: AP-2 adaptor. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The endocytic process plays a critical role in the regulation of various cellular functions, including signal transduction and nutrient uptake. The AP-2 adaptor protein complex, consisting of α, β2, μ2, and σ2 subunits, is well-established for its key involvement in clathrin-mediated endocytosis. Defects in the AP-2 adaptor complex have been implicated in the pathogenesis of various diseases, such as neurodevelopmental disorders and cancer. Additionally, the interaction of the AP-2 adaptor with various membrane proteins, including receptors and transporters, has been shown to be essential for the proper internalization and trafficking of these molecules. Understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying the function of the AP-2 adaptor complex will be crucial for developing targeted interventions aimed at modulating endocytic processes in the context of disease pathology.
