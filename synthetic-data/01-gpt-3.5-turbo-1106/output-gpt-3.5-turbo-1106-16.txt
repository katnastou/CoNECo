prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: T lymphocyte receptors. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The T lymphocyte receptors play a pivotal role in the adaptive immune response by recognizing and binding to specific antigens presented by the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) on the surface of antigen-presenting cells. Activation of T lymphocytes occurs upon engagement of the T lymphocyte receptors with their cognate antigens, leading to T cell proliferation and differentiation. Dysregulation of the T lymphocyte receptor signaling pathway has been implicated in the pathogenesis of various autoimmune diseases, including rheumatoid arthritis and type 1 diabetes. Understanding the molecular mechanisms governing the function of T lymphocyte receptors is critical for the development of targeted immunotherapies aimed at modulating T cell responses in autoimmune and inflammatory conditions.
