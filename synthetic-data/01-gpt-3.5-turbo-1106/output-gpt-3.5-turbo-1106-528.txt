prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: glutamate synthases. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: Glutamate synthases are crucial enzymes in the biosynthesis of glutamate, an essential amino acid in humans. Previous studies have highlighted the importance of glutamate synthases in nitrogen metabolism and amino acid biosynthesis pathways in various organisms. In humans, these enzymes play a pivotal role in maintaining cellular homeostasis and are implicated in several neurological disorders, including Alzheimer's disease and schizophrenia. Recent research has provided new insights into the regulation and function of glutamate synthases, shedding light on their potential as therapeutic targets for the treatment of glutamate-related disorders. Further investigation into the molecular mechanisms underlying the activity of glutamate synthases is warranted to uncover their full potential for clinical applications.
