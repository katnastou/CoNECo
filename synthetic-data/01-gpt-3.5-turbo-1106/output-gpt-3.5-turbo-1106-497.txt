prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: L-tartrate dehydratase. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The role of L-tartrate dehydratase in human health has garnered significant research interest due to its association with metabolic disorders. L-tartrate dehydratase is a vital enzyme in the conversion of L-tartrate to pyruvate, playing a key role in the tricarboxylic acid cycle. Dysregulation of this enzyme has been linked to metabolic acidosis, a condition characterized by excessive acid accumulation in body fluids. Studies have demonstrated that mutations in the gene encoding L-tartrate dehydratase lead to a reduction in enzyme activity, resulting in disrupted metabolic processes. Furthermore, altered L-tartrate dehydratase expression has been observed in patients with metabolic acidosis, highlighting its potential as a diagnostic biomarker for this disorder. The identification of small molecules targeting L-tartrate dehydratase may offer new therapeutic avenues for the treatment of metabolic acidosis.
