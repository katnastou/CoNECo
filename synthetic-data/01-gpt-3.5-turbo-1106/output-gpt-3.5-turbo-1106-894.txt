prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: HDL3. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: High-density lipoprotein 3 (HDL3) is a critical player in the pathophysiology of cardiovascular diseases, particularly atherosclerosis. Several studies have demonstrated the inverse correlation between HDL3 levels and the risk of developing coronary artery disease. Additionally, the cholesterol efflux capacity of HDL3 has been implicated in its atheroprotective functions. Recent research has also revealed the potential role of HDL3 in modulating inflammation and oxidative stress, both of which are central to atherosclerotic plaque formation and progression. Furthermore, the alteration of HDL3 composition and function in conditions such as diabetes mellitus and metabolic syndrome underscores its relevance in metabolic disorders. Given its multifaceted involvement in cardiovascular health, HDL3 represents an attractive target for therapeutic interventions aiming to mitigate atherosclerotic burden and improve clinical outcomes in patients with cardiovascular diseases.
