prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: FO-synthase. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In recent years, the role of the FO-synthase complex in the pathogenesis of mitochondrial disorders has garnered increasing attention. The enzymatic function of FO-synthase is crucial for the proper regulation of oxidative phosphorylation and ATP synthesis in eukaryotic cells. Dysfunction of this complex has been linked to a range of mitochondrial diseases, including Leber's hereditary optic neuropathy and mitochondrial myopathy. Furthermore, recent studies have highlighted the potential of small molecule inhibitors targeting FO-synthase as promising therapeutic strategies for these disorders. These findings underscore the importance of further investigating the molecular mechanisms underlying the function and regulation of the FO-synthase complex in the context of mitochondrial pathology.
