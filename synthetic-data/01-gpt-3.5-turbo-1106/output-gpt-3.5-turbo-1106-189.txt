prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: O-GlcNAc transferases. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The O-GlcNAc transferases (OGT) are a class of enzymes that catalyze the addition of O-linked N-acetylglucosamine (O-GlcNAc) moieties to a variety of nuclear and cytoplasmic proteins, thereby playing a crucial role in the regulation of cellular processes. Dysregulation of O-GlcNAc transferases has been implicated in several human diseases, including cancer, diabetes, and neurodegenerative disorders. Recent studies have highlighted the potential of targeting O-GlcNAc transferases as a therapeutic strategy for treating these diseases. Additionally, understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying the substrate specificity and enzymatic activity of O-GlcNAc transferases is essential for the development of novel pharmacological agents aimed at modulating O-GlcNAcylation levels in disease states.
