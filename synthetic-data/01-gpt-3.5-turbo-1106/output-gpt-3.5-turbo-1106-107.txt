prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: oligosaccharyltransferases. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The role of oligosaccharyltransferases in N-linked protein glycosylation has been a subject of extensive investigation in the field of molecular biology. This enzyme complex plays an essential role in the transfer of oligosaccharide units to nascent proteins within the endoplasmic reticulum, thereby facilitating proper protein folding and stability. Dysregulation of oligosaccharyltransferases has been implicated in various human diseases, including congenital disorders of glycosylation, neurodegenerative diseases, and cancer. The study of oligosaccharyltransferases has therefore garnered significant attention as a potential target for therapeutic intervention in these pathological conditions. Further understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying oligosaccharyltransferase activity may provide insights for the development of novel treatment strategies aimed at modulating protein glycosylation and its associated diseases.
