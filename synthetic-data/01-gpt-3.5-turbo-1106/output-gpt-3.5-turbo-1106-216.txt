prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: plasma membrane succinate dehydrogenase. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: Recent research has highlighted the critical role of plasma membrane succinate dehydrogenase (PMSDH) in the development and progression of a variety of human malignancies. PMSDH has been shown to be dysregulated in several cancer types, including renal cell carcinoma and gastrointestinal stromal tumors, with aberrant expression patterns associated with tumor aggressiveness and poor prognosis. Moreover, PMSDH activity has been implicated in the Warburg effect, suggesting its involvement in cellular metabolic reprogramming and tumor growth. Furthermore, the dysregulation of PMSDH has been linked to abnormal succinate accumulation, leading to mitochondrial dysfunction, increased reactive oxygen species production, and the promotion of tumorigenesis. Understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying PMSDH dysregulation and its impact on cellular metabolism may provide novel insights into the development of targeted therapeutic strategies for cancer management.
