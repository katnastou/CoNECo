prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: peroxisomal import pores. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: Our study investigates the role of peroxisomal import pores in the pathogenesis of X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy (X-ALD). X-ALD is a rare genetic disorder characterized by the accumulation of very long-chain fatty acids (VLCFAs) in the central nervous system, adrenal glands, and testes, leading to progressive neurodegeneration, adrenal insufficiency, and infertility. Peroxisomes are crucial organelles involved in the metabolism of VLCFAs, and the import of these fatty acids into peroxisomes is facilitated by the peroxisomal import pores. Using a murine model of X-ALD, we examined the impact of peroxisomal import pore dysfunction on VLCFA metabolism and the progression of X-ALD pathology. Our findings demonstrate that impaired function of peroxisomal import pores contributes to the dysregulation of VLCFA metabolism, leading to the exacerbation of X-ALD neuroinflammatory responses and demyelination. This study provides insights into the mechanistic link between peroxisomal import pore dysfunction and X-ALD pathogenesis, highlighting the potential of targeting peroxisomal import pores as a therapeutic strategy for ameliorating X-ALD progression.
