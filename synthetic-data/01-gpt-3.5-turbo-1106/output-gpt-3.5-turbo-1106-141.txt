prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: PDGF receptor-ligand. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The PDGF receptor-ligand complex plays a critical role in the regulation of cell proliferation, survival, and differentiation. Previous studies have demonstrated the involvement of this complex in various biological processes, including wound healing, angiogenesis, and tissue remodeling. Dysregulation of the PDGF receptor-ligand complex has been implicated in the pathogenesis of several diseases, such as fibrotic disorders and certain types of cancer. Furthermore, the signaling pathways activated by this complex have been identified as potential therapeutic targets for the development of novel treatments for these conditions. Further elucidation of the molecular mechanisms underlying the functions of the PDGF receptor-ligand complex will provide valuable insights into its physiological and pathological roles, with potential implications for the development of targeted therapies.
