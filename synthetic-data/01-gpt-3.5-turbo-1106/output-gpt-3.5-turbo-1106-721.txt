prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: m6A methyltransferase. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The m6A methyltransferase protein complex has attracted considerable attention due to its crucial role in post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression. Recent studies have identified the involvement of the m6A methyltransferase complex in various cellular processes, including mRNA stability, splicing, and translation. Dysregulation of m6A methyltransferase has been implicated in several human diseases, such as cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, and metabolic syndromes. Understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying the function of the m6A methyltransferase complex holds significant promise for the development of novel therapeutic interventions targeting these disease pathways. Further exploration of the intricate interplay between m6A methyltransferase and its regulatory networks may unveil new opportunities for precision medicine strategies in the treatment of these debilitating conditions.
