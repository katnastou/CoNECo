prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: CDL7. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The CDL7 protein complex has been implicated in the regulation of immune responses and inflammatory pathways in various disease states. Recent studies have shown that dysregulation of CDL7 activity is associated with increased severity of autoimmune disorders, including rheumatoid arthritis and multiple sclerosis. Additionally, chemical inhibitors targeting CDL7 have demonstrated promising therapeutic potential in preclinical models of inflammatory bowel disease and psoriasis. Understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying the function of CDL7 in these pathological processes may offer new insights into the development of targeted therapies for immune-mediated disorders. Further investigations into the role of CDL7 in disease pathogenesis may provide critical advancements in the field of immunology and inflammatory disease research.
