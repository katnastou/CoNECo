prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: IL-15 receptor. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: Activation of the IL-15 receptor has been implicated in the pathogenesis of various autoimmune and inflammatory disorders, including rheumatoid arthritis and inflammatory bowel disease. In recent studies, targeting the IL-15 receptor has shown promising outcomes in preclinical models of these conditions. Interleukin-15, the ligand for the IL-15 receptor, is known to play a crucial role in the survival and proliferation of natural killer cells, as well as in the development and function of memory CD8+ T cells. The IL-15 receptor complex is composed of IL-15Rα, IL-2/IL-15Rβ, and γc subunits, and its dysregulation has been linked to the pathophysiology of various immune-mediated diseases. Understanding the intricate signaling pathways associated with the IL-15 receptor complex may provide new insights for the development of targeted therapies for these debilitating conditions.
