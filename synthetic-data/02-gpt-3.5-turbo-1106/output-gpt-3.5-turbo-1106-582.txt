prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: laminin-12. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we investigated the role of laminin-12 in the progression of muscular dystrophy in a mouse model. We observed a significant decrease in the expression levels of laminin-12 in the muscle tissues of dystrophic mice compared to wild-type controls. Furthermore, we found that administration of a laminin-12-targeting therapeutic compound led to an improvement in muscle strength and a reduction in fibrosis and inflammation in the diseased mice. Our findings suggest that laminin-12 plays a crucial role in the pathogenesis of muscular dystrophy and may represent a promising therapeutic target for the treatment of this debilitating disease.
