prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: coatomer. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The coatomer is a highly conserved protein complex involved in the process of vesicle formation and intracellular trafficking in eukaryotic cells. Previous studies have demonstrated the essential role of coatomer in facilitating the transport of specific cargo proteins from the endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi apparatus. Dysregulation of coatomer function has been implicated in various human diseases, including certain neurodegenerative disorders and metabolic syndromes. Recent investigations have also highlighted the potential involvement of coatomer in the pathogenesis of infectious diseases, shedding light on its significance in the host-pathogen interactions. Understanding the molecular mechanisms governing the activity of coatomer may provide valuable insights for the development of therapeutic interventions targeting related disease processes.
