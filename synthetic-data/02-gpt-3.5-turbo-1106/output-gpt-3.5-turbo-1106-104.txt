prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: IL-7 receptor. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we investigate the role of IL-7 receptor in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Using a murine model of colitis, we observed a significant upregulation of IL-7 receptor expression in the inflamed colonic tissues compared to control tissues. Subsequent analysis revealed a positive correlation between IL-7 receptor levels and disease severity, as well as increased infiltration of proinflammatory T cells in the affected mucosal tissues. Furthermore, blockade of IL-7 receptor signaling using a specific monoclonal antibody resulted in amelioration of colitis symptoms and reduction of inflammatory cytokine production. Our findings suggest that IL-7 receptor may serve as a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of IBD and provide insights into the underlying mechanisms of immune dysregulation in this disorder.
