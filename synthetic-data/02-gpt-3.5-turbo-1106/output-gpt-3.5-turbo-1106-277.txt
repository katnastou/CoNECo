prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: potassium/sodium hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated channel 2. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The potassium/sodium hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated channel 2 (HCN2) has been implicated in the pathophysiology of cardiac arrhythmias. Dysregulation of HCN2 has been associated with an increased risk of atrial fibrillation, a common type of irregular heart rhythm. Recent studies have shown that alterations in the expression and function of HCN2 can impact the resting membrane potential of cardiac myocytes, leading to abnormal conduction of electrical signals within the heart. Furthermore, pharmacological modulation of HCN2 activity has emerged as a potential therapeutic strategy for the management of atrial fibrillation. Understanding the role of HCN2 in cardiac electrophysiology and arrhythmogenesis may provide insights into the development of targeted treatments for this prevalent cardiac disorder.
