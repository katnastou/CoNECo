prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: FO-synthase. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In recent years, the role of FO-synthase in mitochondrial function has garnered significant interest in the study of certain neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease. FO-synthase is a critical component of the mitochondrial electron transport chain and plays a pivotal role in oxidative phosphorylation. Disruption of FO-synthase activity has been implicated in the pathogenesis of these diseases, leading to impaired mitochondrial function and increased oxidative stress. Furthermore, studies have shown that specific small molecule inhibitors of FO-synthase can effectively modulate mitochondrial function, making them potential candidates for therapeutic interventions in neurodegenerative disorders. Understanding the molecular mechanisms underpinning the role of FO-synthase in disease pathogenesis holds promise for the development of novel treatment strategies targeting mitochondrial dysfunction.
