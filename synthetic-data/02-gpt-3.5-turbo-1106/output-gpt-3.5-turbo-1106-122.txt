prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: PeBoW. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The PeBoW protein complex has been implicated in various disease processes, including cancer and autoimmune disorders. Recent studies have suggested a potential role for the PeBoW complex in modulating inflammatory responses through its interaction with key signaling pathways. Furthermore, the complex appears to be involved in cellular processes such as apoptosis and cell cycle regulation. Given its significance in the pathogenesis of several diseases, understanding the functional properties and regulation of the PeBoW complex may provide valuable insights for the development of targeted therapeutics. In addition, the identification of small molecules that selectively modulate the activity of the PeBoW complex holds promise for the treatment of PeBoW-associated disorders. Further investigation into the molecular mechanisms underlying the function of the complex is warranted to uncover potential therapeutic avenues for these conditions.
