prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: ESCRT-2. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The ESCRT-2 protein complex plays a crucial role in the cellular process of endosomal sorting and trafficking. Dysregulation of ESCRT-2 has been implicated in various diseases, including viral infections and neurodegenerative disorders. In a recent study, the interaction between ESCRT-2 and the protein VPS25 was found to be essential for the formation of multivesicular bodies, which are crucial for the degradation of membrane proteins in the endosomal pathway. Furthermore, small molecule inhibitors targeting the ESCRT-2 complex have shown promise in the treatment of certain viral infections such as HIV. Further investigation into the molecular mechanisms underlying ESCRT-2 function will shed light on its potential as a therapeutic target for various human diseases.
