prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: electron transport complex II. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we investigated the role of electron transport complex II in the pathogenesis of mitochondrial diseases. Using a mouse model of inherited metabolic disorder, we observed a significant decrease in the activity of electron transport complex II in affected tissues. This reduction in complex II activity was associated with an accumulation of metabolic intermediates and an increase in reactive oxygen species production. Furthermore, analysis of patient samples revealed similar alterations in electron transport complex II function, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target for the treatment of mitochondrial disorders. Our findings provide valuable insights into the underlying molecular mechanisms of these diseases and offer a promising avenue for future therapeutic interventions.
