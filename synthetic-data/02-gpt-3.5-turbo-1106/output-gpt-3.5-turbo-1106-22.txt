prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: thrombospondin. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we investigated the role of the thrombospondin protein complex in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis. Using a murine model, we observed a significant upregulation of thrombospondin expression in atherosclerotic lesions compared to healthy controls. Furthermore, we found that inhibition of thrombospondin activity using a specific small molecule antagonist led to a reduction in lesion size and improved endothelial function. Our results suggest that the thrombospondin protein complex may contribute to the development and progression of atherosclerosis, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target for cardiovascular diseases.
