prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: FAR. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we investigated the interaction between the FAR protein complex and its potential role in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases. Using a combination of biochemical and molecular biology techniques, we identified novel small molecules that bind to the FAR complex and modulate its activity. Furthermore, we elucidated the downstream signaling pathways influenced by the FAR complex, linking its function to the regulation of oxidative stress and neuronal apoptosis. Our findings suggest that targeting the FAR complex with specific small molecule inhibitors may represent a promising therapeutic strategy for neurodegenerative disorders, such as Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease. These results provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying neurodegeneration and offer potential avenues for the development of novel therapeutic interventions targeting the FAR protein complex.
