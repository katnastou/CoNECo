prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: MPCFERM. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: Recent studies have revealed potential interactions between the MPCFERM protein complex and the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease. The dysregulation of MPCFERM has been implicated in mitochondrial dysfunction, leading to increased oxidative stress and impaired energy metabolism, both of which are pathological hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease. Furthermore, the upregulation of MPCFERM has been associated with aberrant cellular signaling pathways and the accumulation of amyloid-beta plaques in the brain, which are characteristic features of the disease. These findings suggest a potential role for MPCFERM in the molecular mechanisms underlying Alzheimer's disease and highlight the significance of further investigation into the functional implications of MPCFERM dysregulation in the context of neurodegenerative disorders.
