prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: Tenascin-R. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we investigated the role of the extracellular matrix protein complex Tenascin-R in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease. We examined postmortem brain tissues from patients with Alzheimer's disease and age-matched controls to assess the expression and localization of Tenascin-R. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed a significant increase in Tenascin-R levels in the hippocampus and frontal cortex of Alzheimer's disease brains compared to controls. Furthermore, we found a positive correlation between Tenascin-R expression and the accumulation of amyloid-beta plaques and neurofibrillary tangles, hallmark pathologies of Alzheimer's disease. These findings suggest a potential involvement of Tenascin-R in the neurodegenerative processes associated with Alzheimer's disease, highlighting the importance of investigating the role of extracellular matrix proteins in neurodegenerative disorders.
