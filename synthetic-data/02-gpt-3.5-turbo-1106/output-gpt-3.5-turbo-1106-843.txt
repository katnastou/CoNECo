prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: BFC. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The BFC protein complex has been implicated in various pathological conditions, including neurodegenerative disorders and cancer. A recent study investigated the interaction of BFC with small molecule inhibitors, aiming to identify potential therapeutic strategies. Using molecular docking and functional assays, the researchers demonstrated the binding affinity of several compounds to the BFC complex. Additionally, in vivo studies in a mouse model of neurodegeneration revealed promising effects of a lead compound on disease progression. These findings shed light on the role of BFC in disease pathogenesis and highlight the potential of targeting this protein complex for therapeutic intervention.
