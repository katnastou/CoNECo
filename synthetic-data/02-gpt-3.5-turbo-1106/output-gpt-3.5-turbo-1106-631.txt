prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: DBIRD. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In recent years, the DBIRD protein complex has emerged as a critical player in the regulation of RNA processing and transcription. Through its interaction with RNA polymerase II, DBIRD has been shown to impact the splicing of specific gene transcripts, thereby influencing the expression of key genes involved in various cellular processes. Furthermore, studies have implicated DBIRD in the maintenance of genomic stability and the development of certain infectious diseases. The intricate interplay between DBIRD and RNA biology highlights the potential of targeting this protein complex in the development of novel therapeutics for a range of human health conditions. Thus, further investigation into the molecular mechanisms and cellular functions of the DBIRD complex is warranted to uncover its full potential as a therapeutic target.
