prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: GABA-T. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we investigated the role of the GABA-T protein complex in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease. Our results demonstrated a significant upregulation of GABA-T expression in the substantia nigra of Parkinson's disease patients, correlating with the severity of motor symptoms. Furthermore, pharmacological inhibition of GABA-T activity using a novel small molecule inhibitor led to a reduction in neuroinflammation and improved motor function in a murine model of Parkinson's disease. These findings suggest that targeting GABA-T may represent a promising therapeutic strategy for ameliorating the neurodegenerative processes associated with Parkinson's disease. Further studies exploring the molecular mechanisms underlying the involvement of GABA-T in the pathophysiology of Parkinson's disease are warranted.
