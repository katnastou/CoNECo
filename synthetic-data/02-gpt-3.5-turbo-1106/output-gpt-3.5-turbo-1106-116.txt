prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: UvrABC excinuclease. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The UvrABC excinuclease is a key component in the nucleotide excision repair (NER) pathway, a fundamental mechanism for maintaining genomic stability and preventing mutagenesis and cancer development. This protein complex recognizes and removes various DNA lesions induced by a wide array of genotoxic agents, including UV radiation, chemical carcinogens, and chemotherapeutic agents. Dysregulation or impairment of the UvrABC excinuclease has been linked to a heightened susceptibility to skin cancer, xeroderma pigmentosum, and other disorders characterized by defective NER function. Understanding the intricate molecular mechanisms underlying the function and regulation of the UvrABC excinuclease is critical for the development of targeted therapies aimed at enhancing DNA repair and mitigating the detrimental consequences of DNA damage.
