prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: ASCOM. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The ASCOM protein complex plays a critical role in regulating the innate immune response in the context of infection and inflammation. Previous studies have implicated ASCOM in the activation of caspase-1, resulting in the processing and release of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin-1Î². Notably, dysregulation of ASCOM has been associated with several autoimmune disorders, including rheumatoid arthritis and systemic lupus erythematosus. Additionally, recent research has highlighted the potential of small molecule inhibitors targeting the ASCOM complex as a therapeutic strategy for mitigating excessive inflammatory responses in various disease states. Further investigations into the precise mechanisms underlying ASCOM function and its modulation may provide valuable insights for the development of novel treatments for immune-related disorders.
