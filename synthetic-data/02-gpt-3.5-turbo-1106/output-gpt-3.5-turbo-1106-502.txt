prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: PstSCAB. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: Recent studies have shed light on the molecular mechanism underlying the involvement of the PstSCAB protein complex in the pathogenesis of bacterial infections. The PstSCAB complex, known for its role in phosphate transport and utilization in bacteria, has emerged as a potential target for the development of novel antimicrobial agents. In a murine model of systemic infection with multidrug-resistant bacteria, the disruption of PstSCAB function through specific inhibitors resulted in a significant reduction in bacterial load and improved survival rates. Furthermore, investigation of the transcriptional regulation of PstSCAB genes in clinical isolates of bacterial pathogens revealed their upregulation in response to phosphate limitation, indicating a crucial adaptation mechanism for bacterial survival in host environments. These findings underscore the potential of targeting the PstSCAB complex as a promising strategy for combating antimicrobial resistance and infectious diseases.
