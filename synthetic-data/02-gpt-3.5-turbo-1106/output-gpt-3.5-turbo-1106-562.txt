prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: ncBAP. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The role of the nuclear cap-binding complex (ncBAP) in the regulation of gene expression has been increasingly recognized in recent years. Studies have demonstrated that ncBAP interacts with various regulatory elements of the genome, influencing both transcriptional and post-transcriptional processes. Furthermore, dysregulation of ncBAP has been linked to several human diseases, including neurological disorders and cancer. Understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying the function of ncBAP and its associated regulatory pathways may provide a basis for the development of targeted therapeutic interventions for these conditions. In addition, the identification of small molecule modulators of ncBAP activity holds promise for the development of novel pharmaceutical agents with potential clinical applications. Further research into the functional and pathological implications of ncBAP will undoubtedly contribute to our understanding of gene regulation and its impact on human health.
