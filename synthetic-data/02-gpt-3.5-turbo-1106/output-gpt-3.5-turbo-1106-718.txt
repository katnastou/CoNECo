prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: serum ferritin. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we investigated the relationship between serum ferritin levels and the progression of chronic kidney disease (CKD) in a cohort of 200 patients. Serum ferritin, a protein complex involved in iron storage and regulation, has been reported to play a critical role in the pathogenesis of various diseases, including CKD. Our results revealed a significant positive correlation between serum ferritin levels and the severity of CKD, as assessed by estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and proteinuria. Furthermore, elevated serum ferritin levels were associated with an increased risk of developing cardiovascular complications, such as hypertension and atherosclerosis, in CKD patients. These findings highlight the potential of serum ferritin as a prognostic biomarker for assessing the progression and cardiovascular outcomes of CKD. Further studies are warranted to elucidate the underlying mechanisms linking serum ferritin and CKD progression, with implications for the development of targeted therapeutic interventions.
