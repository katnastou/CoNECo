prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: EMC. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The endoplasmic reticulum membrane complex (EMC) is a conserved multi-subunit complex critical for maintaining endoplasmic reticulum (ER) homeostasis. Dysfunction of the EMC complex has been implicated in a variety of human diseases, including genetic disorders characterized by ER stress and protein-folding defects. Recent studies have identified a role for the EMC complex in the quality control of ER membrane proteins, lipid metabolism, and calcium homeostasis. Additionally, the EMC complex has been implicated in the regulation of ER-associated degradation (ERAD) pathways, further underscoring its importance in maintaining cellular health. Understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying EMC complex function may provide insights into novel therapeutic strategies for combating ER stress-related diseases.
