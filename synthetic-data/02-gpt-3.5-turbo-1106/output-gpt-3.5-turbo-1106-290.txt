prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: SALSA. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The SALSA protein complex has been found to play a crucial role in the regulation of inflammatory responses in the context of rheumatoid arthritis. Through its interaction with the CCL2 chemokine, SALSA modulates the recruitment and activation of immune cells within the synovial tissue, contributing to the progression of joint inflammation and tissue damage. Recent studies have implicated SALSA in the pathogenesis of autoimmunity, shedding light on its potential as a therapeutic target in rheumatoid arthritis. Understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying the involvement of SALSA in the inflammatory cascade may offer novel insights into the development of targeted therapies for this debilitating autoimmune disease.
