prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: CRL7. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we investigated the role of the CRL7 protein complex in the development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). We examined tissue samples from patients with HCC and found a significant upregulation of CRL7 expression compared to normal liver tissues. Furthermore, our in vitro experiments demonstrated that inhibition of CRL7 using a specific chemical inhibitor led to a decrease in cell proliferation and an increase in apoptosis in HCC cell lines. Our findings indicate that CRL7 may play a critical role in the progression of HCC and could serve as a potential therapeutic target for this deadly disease. Further research is needed to elucidate the specific mechanisms by which CRL7 contributes to HCC development and to explore the potential of targeting CRL7 in clinical settings.
