prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: cullin-RING ligase 7. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: Cullin-RING ligase 7 (CRL7) is a crucial component of the ubiquitin-proteasome system, which plays a pivotal role in the regulation of cellular processes. Recent studies have demonstrated that CRL7 is implicated in the progression of various diseases, including cancer and neurodegenerative disorders. Dysregulation of CRL7 expression has been linked to aberrant cell cycle control and defective DNA repair mechanisms, which may contribute to the pathogenesis of cancer. Additionally, CRL7 has been shown to interact with specific chemical compounds that modulate its activity, providing potential opportunities for therapeutic intervention. Further investigation into the molecular mechanisms and cellular functions of CRL7 is imperative for a comprehensive understanding of its role in health and disease.
