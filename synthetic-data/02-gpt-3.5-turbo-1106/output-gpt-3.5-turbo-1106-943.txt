prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: TauD. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we investigated the role of the TauD protein complex in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease in a transgenic mouse model. The presence of TauD was found to be significantly elevated in the brains of mice exhibiting cognitive impairment compared to age-matched control mice. Furthermore, we identified a novel small molecule inhibitor that effectively decreased TauD levels in vitro and in vivo, leading to improvements in memory and learning behaviors in the treated animals. These findings suggest that targeting the TauD protein complex may offer a promising therapeutic strategy for ameliorating cognitive decline associated with Alzheimer's disease.
