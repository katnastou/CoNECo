prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: FRG. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In recent biomedical research, the role of the FRG protein complex has been of particular interest due to its potential implications in the pathogenesis of muscular dystrophy. Through extensive analysis of patient samples and animal models, it has become evident that the dysregulation of the FRG complex is associated with the progression of muscular dystrophy, leading to disruptions in muscle function and overall disease severity. Moreover, investigations into the molecular mechanisms underlying the involvement of the FRG complex in muscular dystrophy have revealed promising potential therapeutic targets, offering new avenues for the development of targeted interventions to alleviate disease progression. These findings highlight the significance of further exploring the interplay between the FRG complex and muscular dystrophy, paving the way for novel treatment strategies within the realm of neuromuscular disorders.
