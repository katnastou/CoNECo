prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2B. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: Eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2B (eIF2B) is a key regulator of protein synthesis and indispensable for cellular homeostasis. Mutations in the genes encoding eIF2B subunits have been implicated in the pathogenesis of Vanishing White Matter (VWM) disease, a severe leukodystrophy affecting the white matter of the central nervous system. VWM is associated with dysregulated protein synthesis and impaired myelination processes. Recent studies have shown that small molecule modulators of eIF2B activity can mitigate the aberrant protein synthesis and alleviate VWM pathology in preclinical models. These findings provide a promising avenue for the development of novel therapeutic strategies targeting eIF2B dysfunction in VWM and other protein synthesis-related disorders.
