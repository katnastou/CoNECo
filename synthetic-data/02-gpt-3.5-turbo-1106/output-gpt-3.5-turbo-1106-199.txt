prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: fhuCDB. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The fhuCDB protein complex plays a crucial role in the iron uptake process in Gram-negative bacteria. Recent studies have demonstrated that the fhuCDB complex is essential for the survival and virulence of several pathogenic bacteria, including Escherichia coli and Salmonella enterica. The disruption of fhuCDB function has been linked to decreased bacterial growth and increased susceptibility to iron starvation, highlighting the importance of this complex in iron acquisition and maintenance of bacterial fitness. Additionally, the fhuCDB complex has been identified as a potential target for the development of novel antimicrobial agents aimed at disrupting iron homeostasis in pathogenic bacteria. Further investigation into the molecular mechanisms and functional significance of the fhuCDB complex is necessary to elucidate its potential as a therapeutic target for combating bacterial infections.
