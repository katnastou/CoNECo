prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: ulaABC. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we investigated the functional role of the UlaABC protein complex in the context of vitamin C metabolism. Our results demonstrate that the ulaABC complex is critical for the transport and utilization of l-ascorbic acid in E. coli. Through a series of in vivo and in vitro experiments, we show that disruption of the ulaABC complex led to impaired l-ascorbic acid uptake and utilization, resulting in reduced cellular levels of vitamin C. Furthermore, our findings suggest that the ulaABC complex plays a key role in regulating the redox balance within the cell, highlighting its significance in maintaining cellular homeostasis. These findings provide novel insights into the molecular mechanisms governing vitamin C metabolism and underscore the importance of the ulaABC complex in bacterial physiology.
