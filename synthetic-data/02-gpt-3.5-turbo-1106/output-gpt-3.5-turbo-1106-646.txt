prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: TRAP. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we investigated the role of the TRAP protein complex in the pathogenesis of osteoporosis. Using a murine model, we observed reduced bone mineral density and increased bone resorption in TRAP-knockout mice compared to wild-type controls. Furthermore, analysis of serum biomarkers revealed elevated levels of tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase, a marker of osteoclast activity, in the TRAP-deficient mice. Our results suggest that TRAP plays a critical role in regulating osteoclast function and bone homeostasis. Targeting the TRAP complex may therefore provide a potential therapeutic strategy for the treatment of osteoporosis and other bone-related disorders.
