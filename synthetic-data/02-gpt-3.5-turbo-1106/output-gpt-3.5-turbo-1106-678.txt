prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: DOM-B. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In recent years, research into the molecular mechanisms underlying neurodegenerative diseases has uncovered the involvement of various protein complexes. Among these, the DOM-B complex has emerged as a key player in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease. In a study investigating the role of DOM-B in neuroinflammation, researchers found that its dysregulation resulted in aberrant pro-inflammatory signaling within glial cells. Furthermore, the study demonstrated that inhibition of DOM-B activity attenuated neuroinflammatory responses in a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease. These findings highlight the potential therapeutic implications of targeting the DOM-B complex in mitigating neuroinflammation associated with Alzheimer's disease. This research opens new avenues for the development of novel treatment strategies aimed at modulating DOM-B function to alleviate neurodegenerative pathologies.
