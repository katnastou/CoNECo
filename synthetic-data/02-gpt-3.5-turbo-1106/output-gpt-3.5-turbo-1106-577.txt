prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: RNA polymerase I. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we investigated the role of the RNA polymerase I (Pol I) complex in the progression of colorectal cancer. Utilizing a mouse model of colorectal cancer, we observed a significant upregulation of Pol I activity in tumor tissues compared to normal colon tissues. Furthermore, we found that inhibition of Pol I activity using the specific small molecule inhibitor CX-5464 resulted in a significant reduction in tumor growth and metastasis. Mechanistically, we demonstrated that dysregulation of the Pol I complex led to aberrant ribosomal RNA synthesis, promoting oncogenic signaling and tumor progression. Our findings highlight the potential of targeting the RNA polymerase I complex as a therapeutic strategy for colorectal cancer treatment.
