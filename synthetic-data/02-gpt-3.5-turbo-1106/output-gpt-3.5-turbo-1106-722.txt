prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: paaABCE. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we investigated the role of the paaABCE protein complex in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis in ApoE-deficient mice. We found that administration of a specific chemical compound, ethyl-3-hydroxybenzoate, led to a significant reduction in the expression of the paaABCE complex in the aortic tissues of the test animals. Furthermore, histological analysis revealed a concomitant decrease in atherosclerotic plaque formation compared to control mice. Our findings suggest that targeting the paaABCE complex may present a promising therapeutic strategy for the management of atherosclerosis and related cardiovascular diseases.
