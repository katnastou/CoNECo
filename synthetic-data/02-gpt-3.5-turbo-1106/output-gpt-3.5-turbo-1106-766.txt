prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: artPIQM. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: A recent study investigated the potential role of the artPIQM protein complex in the pathogenesis of systemic lupus erythematosus. Through a comprehensive analysis of patient serum samples, researchers observed a significant correlation between artPIQM levels and disease severity, as well as the presence of anti-dsDNA antibodies. Furthermore, in vitro experiments demonstrated that artPIQM may modulate the expression of cytokines involved in the immune response. These findings suggest a potential link between artPIQM and the dysregulation of the immune system in systemic lupus erythematosus, highlighting the complex interplay between protein complexes and autoimmune diseases. Further investigation into the mechanisms underlying these observations may provide insights into novel therapeutic targets for managing systemic lupus erythematosus.
