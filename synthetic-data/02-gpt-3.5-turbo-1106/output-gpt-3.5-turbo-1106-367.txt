prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: Five Friends of Methylated Chtop. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The Five Friends of Methylated Chtop (5FMC) protein complex has garnered significant interest in the field of epigenetics due to its role in regulating gene expression and RNA processing. Research has shown that the 5FMC complex is involved in the recognition and binding of methylated Chtop, a key RNA-binding protein that modulates mRNA stability and splicing. Dysregulation of the 5FMC complex has been implicated in various human diseases, including cancer and neurodegenerative disorders. Furthermore, the complex has been found to interact with a range of chemical compounds, suggesting potential for pharmacological intervention. Understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying the function of the 5FMC complex may offer valuable insights for the development of novel therapeutic strategies targeting epigenetic dysregulation.
