prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: divisome. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The divisome plays a critical role in orchestrating the physical division of bacterial cells by coordinating a series of intricate molecular events. Recent studies have revealed the involvement of the divisome in regulating the dynamic assembly and localization of key components such as FtsZ, FtsA, and FtsI, which are essential for the successful completion of cell division. Furthermore, the divisome has been implicated in the response to various stressors, including antibiotic treatment, and its dysfunction has been associated with aberrant cell division and the emergence of antibiotic-resistant strains. Given its pivotal role in bacterial proliferation and survival, understanding the regulatory mechanisms and molecular interactions within the divisome represents an important avenue for the development of novel antimicrobial strategies.
