prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: condensin I. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The functionality of condensin I, a key protein complex involved in chromatin condensation and organization, has been implicated in various disease states, such as cancer and developmental disorders. Recent studies have focused on elucidating the molecular mechanisms underlying the regulation of condensin I activity in response to different cellular and environmental stimuli. Additionally, the targeting of condensin I as a potential therapeutic strategy for certain types of cancer has garnered significant interest. This protein complex, composed of structural and regulatory subunits, is known to interact with various cellular and nuclear components, influencing genome stability and gene expression. Further investigation into the intricate roles of condensin I in cellular processes and disease pathogenesis holds promise for advancing our understanding of chromatin dynamics and developing novel therapeutic interventions.
