prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: holo-RdRp. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we investigated the role of holo-RdRp in the replication and transcription of viral RNA in human cells. We utilized a combination of biochemical assays, cell culture experiments, and structural analysis to elucidate the functional significance of holo-RdRp in the lifecycle of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Our results demonstrate that holo-RdRp plays a crucial role in mediating the viral RNA synthesis process, highlighting its potential as a target for antiviral therapeutics. Furthermore, our findings shed light on the molecular mechanisms underlying viral replication and provide insights into the development of novel strategies for combatting SARS-CoV-2 infection. This work has significant implications for the understanding of viral pathogenesis and the identification of potential drug targets for therapeutic intervention against COVID-19.
