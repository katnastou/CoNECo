prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: RuvABC Holliday junction resolvasome. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The RuvABC Holliday junction resolvasome is a key player in the DNA repair machinery of bacterial organisms. This protein complex is known for its ability to resolve Holliday junction intermediates during genetic recombination and repair processes. Recent studies have shown that the resolvasome plays a crucial role in maintaining genomic integrity in pathogenic bacteria, offering a potential target for the development of novel antimicrobial strategies. Furthermore, dysregulation of the RuvABC Holliday junction resolvasome has been implicated in various bacterial infections and has emerged as a potential therapeutic target for combating antibiotic resistance. These findings underscore the importance of further investigating the molecular mechanisms underlying the function of the resolvasome in bacterial physiology and pathogenesis.
