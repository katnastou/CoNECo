prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: cytosolic FAS. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The role of the cytosolic FAS protein complex in lipid metabolism has been widely studied due to its crucial involvement in the regulation of fatty acid biosynthesis. Recent investigations have demonstrated a potential link between aberrant activity of cytosolic FAS and the development of metabolic disorders such as obesity and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. Given the metabolic significance of FAS, it is imperative to further explore the mechanisms governing its regulation and potential therapeutic targets to mitigate the pathological effects associated with dysregulated lipid metabolism. This area of research holds promise for the development of novel interventions aimed at ameliorating metabolic dysfunction and its associated health complications.
