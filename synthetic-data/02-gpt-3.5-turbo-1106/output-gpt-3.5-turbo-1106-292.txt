prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: 20S core. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The 20S core is a crucial proteasomal subunit involved in the ubiquitin-proteasome system, which plays a pivotal role in maintaining cellular homeostasis by degrading damaged or misfolded proteins. Dysregulation of the ubiquitin-proteasome system has been implicated in various pathological conditions, including neurodegenerative diseases, cancer, and autoimmune disorders. The 20S core is composed of multiple subunits and is responsible for the catalytic degradation of targeted proteins. Recent studies have identified small molecule inhibitors that selectively target the 20S core, offering potential therapeutic avenues for modulating proteasome activity in disease states. Understanding the intricate mechanisms governing the 20S core and its regulatory pathways is critical for the development of novel treatments targeting proteasomal dysfunction in human health and disease.
