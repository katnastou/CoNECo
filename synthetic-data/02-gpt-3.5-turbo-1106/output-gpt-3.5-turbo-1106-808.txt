prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: eIF-2. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The eIF-2 protein complex has long been recognized for its crucial role in the initiation of protein synthesis in eukaryotic cells. Dysregulation of eIF-2 function has been implicated in a variety of diseases, including neurodegenerative disorders and cancer. Recent studies have shed light on the intricate interplay between eIF-2 and various chemical signaling pathways, particularly those involving stress-responsive kinases and phosphatases. Furthermore, the role of eIF-2 in host-pathogen interactions has garnered significant attention, as pathogens have been shown to manipulate the eIF-2 complex to hijack host cell translation machinery for their own benefit. Understanding the intricate mechanisms governing eIF-2 function has the potential to uncover novel therapeutic targets for a wide array of human diseases.
