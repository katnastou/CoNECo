prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: FSH. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In recent decades, the follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) has emerged as a critical regulator of reproductive function in both male and female organisms. Clinical studies have highlighted the importance of FSH in the development and maturation of follicles in the ovaries and the production of sperm in the testes. Dysregulation of FSH levels has been associated with various reproductive disorders, including polycystic ovary syndrome and male infertility. Furthermore, the use of FSH analogs has revolutionized the treatment of infertility, offering new possibilities for assisted reproduction techniques. With ongoing research efforts focused on elucidating the precise mechanisms underlying FSH action and developing novel therapeutic interventions targeting FSH signaling pathways, the potential for breakthroughs in the field of reproductive medicine fueled by a deeper understanding of the FSH protein complex is promising.
