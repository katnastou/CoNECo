prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: OSTCI. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In recent years, the association between the OSTCI protein complex and osteosarcoma has garnered significant attention in the biomedical research community. Osteosarcoma, a primary malignant bone tumor, is characterized by its aggressive behavior and high proclivity for metastasis. Several studies have demonstrated the pivotal role of the OSTCI complex in promoting tumorigenesis and metastasis in osteosarcoma. Furthermore, it has been shown that chemical modulation of the OSTCI complex can influence the progression of osteosarcoma, providing a potential avenue for therapeutic intervention. These findings underscore the importance of further investigating the mechanistic underpinnings of the OSTCI complex in osteosarcoma pathogenesis, which may ultimately lead to the development of novel targeted therapies for this devastating disease.
