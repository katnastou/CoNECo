prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: Prohibitin. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The role of the Prohibitin protein complex in the pathogenesis of cancer has garnered increasing interest in recent years. An emerging body of evidence implicates Prohibitin in the regulation of cell proliferation, apoptosis, and mitochondrial function, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target in cancer treatment. Mounting data from in vitro and in vivo studies indicate a complex interplay between Prohibitin, various oncogenes, and tumor suppressor proteins, with implications for tumor initiation, progression, and metastasis. Furthermore, the association of Prohibitin with chemotherapeutic resistance and its potential as a prognostic biomarker in various cancer types warrant further investigation. This growing understanding of Prohibitin's multifaceted role in oncogenesis may pave the way for the development of novel, targeted anticancer strategies.
