prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: yeast spliceosomal complex B. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we aimed to investigate the functional role of the yeast spliceosomal complex B in mRNA splicing regulation. Utilizing a series of genetic and biochemical assays, we elucidated the involvement of this protein complex in the splicing of introns during gene expression. Our findings demonstrate the indispensability of the yeast spliceosomal complex B in the accurate removal of non-coding sequences from pre-mRNA molecules. Interestingly, we also identified a potential association between the malfunction of this complex and the onset of splicing-related disorders, highlighting its clinical relevance. These insights provide a better understanding of the regulatory mechanisms underlying mRNA processing and offer potential therapeutic targets for diseases associated with aberrant splicing.
