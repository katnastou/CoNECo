prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: 13S condensin. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The 13S condensin protein complex has been shown to play a crucial role in the regulation of chromosomal architecture during mitosis in eukaryotic organisms. Recent studies have demonstrated that the 13S condensin complex interacts with DNA and histones to promote chromosome condensation and segregation. Dysfunction of the 13S condensin complex has been implicated in various human diseases, including cancer and developmental disorders. Understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying the function of 13S condensin may provide valuable insights into the pathogenesis of these diseases and could potentially lead to the development of novel therapeutic interventions targeting this protein complex.
