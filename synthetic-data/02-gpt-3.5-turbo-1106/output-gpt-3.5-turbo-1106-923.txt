prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: laminin-3A32. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we aimed to investigate the role of laminin-3A32 in the pathogenesis of diabetic nephropathy. Diabetic nephropathy is a common and serious complication of diabetes, characterized by progressive decline in kidney function. We used a mouse model of diabetes to elucidate the expression and localization of laminin-3A32 in renal tissue. Our results demonstrated a significant upregulation of laminin-3A32 in the glomerular basement membrane of diabetic mice compared to non-diabetic controls. Furthermore, we observed a correlation between the expression levels of laminin-3A32 and the severity of proteinuria in diabetic mice. These findings suggest that laminin-3A32 may play a crucial role in the development and progression of diabetic nephropathy, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target for this debilitating condition.
