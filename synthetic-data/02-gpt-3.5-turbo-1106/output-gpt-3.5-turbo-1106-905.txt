prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: surface IgG4. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: Surface IgG4 is a crucial component of the humoral immune response and is responsible for regulating the recognition and clearance of antigens by B lymphocytes. The interaction of surface IgG4 with antigens is known to be implicated in the pathogenesis of certain autoimmune disorders, such as systemic lupus erythematosus and immune complex-mediated glomerulonephritis. Recent studies have demonstrated a potential association between an increased expression of surface IgG4 and the progression of chronic kidney disease in patients with IgA nephropathy. Furthermore, the therapeutic targeting of surface IgG4 has shown promise in attenuating the severity of autoimmune disorders. This highlights the importance of further investigation into the role of surface IgG4 in the development and treatment of autoimmune diseases.
