prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: MIB. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In recent years, the MIB protein complex has emerged as a crucial regulator of Notch signaling, a pathway known for its pivotal role in various developmental processes and tumorigenesis. The MIB complex has been implicated in the ubiquitination and subsequent degradation of key Notch pathway components, leading to notable downstream effects on cell fate determination and tissue homeostasis. Dysregulation of MIB complex activity has been associated with a spectrum of human diseases, including certain types of leukemia and developmental disorders. Given its significant role in disease pathogenesis, the MIB complex represents a promising therapeutic target for intervention in Notch-related malignancies and developmental abnormalities. Further investigation into the precise mechanisms governing MIB complex function is warranted to fully elucidate its potential as a therapeutic target.
