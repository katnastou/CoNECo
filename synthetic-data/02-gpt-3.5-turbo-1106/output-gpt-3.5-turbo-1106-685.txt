prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: PreaTs. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The PreaTs protein complex has been implicated in various cellular signaling pathways and has garnered attention for its potential role in cancer development and progression. Studies have revealed the association of PreaTs with the regulation of key cellular processes, including cell adhesion, migration, and invasion. Furthermore, aberrant expression of PreaTs has been observed in numerous cancer types, suggesting its potential as a prognostic marker and therapeutic target. Mechanistic investigations have uncovered crosstalk between PreaTs and certain oncogenic signaling pathways, highlighting the complex interplay between this protein complex and cancer-related processes. Future research efforts are warranted to elucidate the detailed molecular mechanisms underlying the involvement of PreaTs in cancer pathogenesis, with the ultimate goal of harnessing this knowledge for the development of novel targeted therapies.
