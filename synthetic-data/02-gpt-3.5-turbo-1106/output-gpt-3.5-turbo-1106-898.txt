prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: RNR. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The role of the ribonucleotide reductase (RNR) protein complex in tumor development and progression has been of considerable interest in cancer research. Previous studies have shown that RNR is a crucial enzyme in the biosynthesis of deoxyribonucleotides, which are essential for DNA replication and repair. Dysregulation of RNR has been associated with increased genomic instability and malignant transformation in various cancer types. Furthermore, it has been demonstrated that targeting RNR activity with pharmacological inhibitors, such as hydroxyurea, can suppress tumor cell proliferation and induce apoptosis in preclinical models. Therefore, the RNR protein complex presents a potential therapeutic target for cancer treatment, and further understanding of its molecular function and regulation may lead to the development of novel anti-cancer strategies.
