prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: Tenascin-N. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: Recent studies have implicated the role of Tenascin-N in the pathogenesis of certain neurological disorders. Tenascin-N has been found to be upregulated in the brain tissue of individuals with Alzheimer's disease, indicating its potential involvement in the pathophysiology of this neurodegenerative condition. Additionally, in a mouse model of traumatic brain injury, increased expression of Tenascin-N was observed in the injured brain regions, suggesting its association with the inflammatory response and tissue remodeling processes following acute brain injury. Moreover, the involvement of Tenascin-N in synaptic plasticity and neuronal development has been identified, highlighting its broader implications in neurobiology. These findings underscore the significance of further investigation into the molecular mechanisms underlying the role of Tenascin-N in neurological disorders, which may offer new insights for developing therapeutic interventions targeting this specific protein complex.
