prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: WASH. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In recent years, the WASH protein complex has garnered attention for its potential role in cellular morphology and function. Through its association with the Arp2/3 complex and actin polymerization, WASH has been implicated in various cellular processes, including endosomal trafficking and membrane remodeling. Additionally, studies have highlighted the potential involvement of WASH in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease, where dysregulation of endosomal trafficking has been linked to disease progression. Furthermore, the interaction between WASH and various cytoskeletal regulators has been proposed to contribute to cancer progression and metastasis. Given its diverse roles and implications in pathophysiology, further exploration of the WASH protein complex may shed light on novel therapeutic targets for a range of diseases.
