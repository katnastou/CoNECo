prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: Swm. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In recent years, the protein complex Swm has emerged as a key player in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases. The interaction between Swm and certain chemical agents has been shown to modulate the inflammatory response in microglial cells, suggesting a potential link between Swm and the progression of Alzheimer's disease. Furthermore, studies have demonstrated that genetic variations in organisms can affect the expression levels of Swm, leading to alterations in synaptic plasticity and cognitive function. These findings highlight the intricate involvement of Swm in the molecular mechanisms underlying neurodegeneration and provide novel insights into potential therapeutic targets for the treatment of neurological disorders.
