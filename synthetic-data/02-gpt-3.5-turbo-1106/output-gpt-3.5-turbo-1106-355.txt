prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: UvrBC. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The UvrBC protein complex plays a crucial role in the cellular response to UV-induced DNA damage in bacteria. Upon exposure to ultraviolet radiation, UvrBC recognizes and binds to the damaged DNA, facilitating the recruitment of other repair factors, such as UvrA and UvrD, to the site of damage. The coordinated action of UvrBC with other nucleotide excision repair proteins, including UvrA and UvrD, ensures efficient removal of the DNA lesion and subsequent restoration of genomic integrity. Mutations in the genes encoding UvrBC have been associated with increased susceptibility to UV-induced mutagenesis and carcinogenesis in bacterial populations. Understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying UvrBC-mediated DNA repair may provide insights into potential therapeutic strategies for UV-related diseases and disorders.
