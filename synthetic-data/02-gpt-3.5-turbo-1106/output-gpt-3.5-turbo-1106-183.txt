prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: RC. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we investigated the role of the RC protein complex in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative disorders. Using a transgenic mouse model overexpressing mutant alpha-synuclein, we observed a significant upregulation of RC in the brain tissue of affected animals compared to control mice. Additionally, treatment with a small molecule inhibitor targeting the RC complex led to a reduction in the severity of motor dysfunction and a decrease in the aggregation of alpha-synuclein. These findings suggest that modulating RC activity may hold promise as a therapeutic strategy for neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's and Alzheimer's. Further research into the molecular mechanisms underlying the interaction between RC and alpha-synuclein is warranted to elucidate the potential therapeutic implications of targeting this protein complex.
