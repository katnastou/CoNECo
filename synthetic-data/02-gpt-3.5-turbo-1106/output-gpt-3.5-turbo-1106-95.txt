prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: CDL4. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The role of the CDL4 protein complex in modulating the progression of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) has been the subject of significant research interest. In a recent study, the expression levels of CDL4 were found to be significantly elevated in CLL patients compared to healthy controls. Furthermore, inhibition of CDL4 activity resulted in a marked reduction in CLL cell viability and proliferation, suggesting a key role for this protein complex in the pathogenesis of the disease. Interestingly, CDL4 activity was found to be regulated by the binding of specific small molecule inhibitors, highlighting the potential for targeted therapeutic interventions in CLL. These findings provide important insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying CLL and suggest that targeting CDL4 may represent a promising approach for the development of novel therapeutics for this devastating disease.
