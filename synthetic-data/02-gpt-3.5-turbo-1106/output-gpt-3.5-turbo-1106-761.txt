prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: CCC. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: Recent research has highlighted the essential role of the CCC protein complex in cellular homeostasis and disease progression. The CCC complex has been shown to interact with a wide array of cellular components, including small molecules and macromolecules, influencing various cellular processes. Studies have revealed that dysregulation of the CCC complex is associated with the development of several diseases, including cancer and neurodegenerative disorders. Furthermore, CCC complex-targeting therapies have emerged as potential treatment strategies for such conditions. Understanding the diverse functions and regulatory mechanisms of the CCC complex is crucial for the development of novel therapeutic interventions. This underscores the importance of further investigating the intricate molecular interactions involving the CCC complex and its impact on cellular physiology and pathology.
