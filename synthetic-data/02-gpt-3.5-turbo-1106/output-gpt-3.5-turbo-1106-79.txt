model: gpt-3.5-turbo-1106
prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: gamma-tubulin large. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we aimed to investigate the role of the gamma-tubulin large complex in the regulation of centrosome organization and microtubule nucleation in ovarian cancer. We utilized an in vitro model system to assess the impact of gamma-tubulin large complex inhibition on cancer cell proliferation and migration. Our results demonstrated a significant decrease in centrosome integrity and microtubule nucleation capacity upon knockdown of the gamma-tubulin large complex. Furthermore, we observed a reduction in cancer cell proliferation and migration, suggesting a potential therapeutic target for ovarian cancer. These findings highlight the importance of the gamma-tubulin large complex in maintaining centrosome function and its potential as a molecular target for cancer therapy.
