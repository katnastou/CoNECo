prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: AREX. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we investigated the role of the AREX protein complex in the pathogenesis of myocardial infarction (MI). Using an animal model of MI, we observed a significant upregulation of AREX expression in the myocardium following ischemic injury. Furthermore, through pharmacological inhibition of AREX, we observed a reduction in infarct size and improved cardiac function, indicating that AREX plays a crucial role in the progression of MI. Additionally, analysis of AREX-interacting proteins revealed potential interactions with key signaling molecules implicated in cardiac remodeling and fibrosis. Our findings suggest that targeting the AREX protein complex may hold therapeutic potential for mitigating the adverse effects of MI on cardiac function.
