prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: N-terminal acetyltransferase A. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we investigated the role of N-terminal acetyltransferase A (NatA) in the modulation of cellular response to oxidative stress. Using a model organism, Caenorhabditis elegans, we observed that NatA-deficient mutants exhibited increased susceptibility to oxidative damage compared to wild-type controls. Furthermore, we found that NatA activity was essential for the proper acetylation of a key antioxidant transcription factor, SKN-1, which is known to regulate the expression of stress response genes. Our findings suggest that NatA-mediated acetylation of SKN-1 plays a crucial role in the coordinated response to oxidative stress in C. elegans. This study provides insight into the molecular mechanisms governing cellular adaptation to redox imbalance and highlights the importance of NatA in the regulation of oxidative stress response pathways. These discoveries may have implications for understanding and potentially treating oxidative stress-related diseases in humans.
