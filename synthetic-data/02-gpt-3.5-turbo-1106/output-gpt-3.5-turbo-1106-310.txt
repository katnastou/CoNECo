prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: IgM immunoglobulin. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The IgM immunoglobulin is a key component of the immune system, playing a crucial role in the recognition and neutralization of pathogens. In various studies, the levels of IgM immunoglobulin have been found to be elevated in individuals with autoimmune diseases, such as systemic lupus erythematosus and rheumatoid arthritis. Furthermore, the interaction between IgM immunoglobulin and antigens has been implicated in the pathogenesis of certain infectious diseases, including malaria and dengue fever. Understanding the function and regulation of IgM immunoglobulin is essential for the development of targeted therapies for autoimmune and infectious diseases. This protein complex represents a promising therapeutic target for modulating immune responses and combating a range of immunological disorders.
