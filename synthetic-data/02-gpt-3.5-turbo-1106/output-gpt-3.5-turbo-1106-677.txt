prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: 5-HT receptor. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: Recent studies have highlighted the importance of the 5-HT receptor in the pathophysiology of depression. Serotonin, the endogenous ligand for the 5-HT receptor, is known to play a crucial role in mood regulation. Dysregulation of the serotonin system has been implicated in the development of major depressive disorder. Antidepressant medications such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) act on the 5-HT receptor to modulate serotonin signaling, thereby alleviating depressive symptoms. Despite the clinical efficacy of these drugs, a proportion of patients exhibit resistance to treatment, highlighting the need for further research into the molecular mechanisms underlying 5-HT receptor signaling in depression. Understanding the intricate network of interactions involving the 5-HT receptor may provide novel targets for the development of more effective therapeutics for this debilitating psychiatric condition.
