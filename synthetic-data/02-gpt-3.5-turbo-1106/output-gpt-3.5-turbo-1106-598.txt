prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: surface IgG. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The surface IgG protein complex is involved in the recognition and opsonization of pathogens in the immune response. It plays a crucial role in the interaction between B cells and antigens, leading to the generation of specific antibodies. Recent studies have implicated the dysregulation of surface IgG in autoimmune disorders such as systemic lupus erythematosus and rheumatoid arthritis. In addition, the binding of surface IgG to complement proteins has been shown to promote the inflammatory response and tissue damage in various organ systems. Understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying the function of surface IgG may provide insights into the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases and lead to the development of targeted therapeutic interventions.
