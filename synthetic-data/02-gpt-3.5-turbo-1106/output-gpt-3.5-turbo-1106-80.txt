prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: HDL2. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: Recent studies have elucidated a potential novel role for the HDL2 protein complex in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis. Accumulating evidence suggests that the dysregulation of HDL2 may contribute to the progression of this vascular disease. The association between HDL2 and atherosclerosis has been demonstrated in animal models as well as clinical studies in human populations. Furthermore, studies investigating the effect of pharmacological interventions targeting HDL2 have shown promising results in mitigating atherosclerotic plaque formation. These findings highlight the significance of HDL2 as a potential therapeutic target for the management of atherosclerosis and associated cardiovascular complications. Further investigations are warranted to fully elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying the involvement of HDL2 in atherosclerosis and to explore its potential as a prognostic biomarker for cardiovascular disease.
