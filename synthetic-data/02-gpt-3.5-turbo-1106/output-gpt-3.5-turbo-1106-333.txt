prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: respiratory chain complex III. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The respiratory chain complex III is an essential component of the mitochondrial electron transport chain, which plays a critical role in cellular respiration. Dysfunctions in the respiratory chain complex III have been implicated in a variety of human diseases, including mitochondrial myopathies and multisystem disorders. Mutations in genes encoding subunits of the respiratory chain complex III have been associated with a range of clinical manifestations, such as exercise intolerance, cardiomyopathy, and neurological deficits. Furthermore, chemical inhibitors targeting the respiratory chain complex III have been identified as potential therapeutics for certain neoplastic diseases. Understanding the structure and function of respiratory chain complex III is imperative for elucidating the molecular basis of these pathologies and for the development of targeted therapeutic interventions.
