prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: discoidal HDL. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we investigated the role of the discoidal HDL complex in atherosclerosis development in a mouse model. We observed a significant reduction in atherosclerotic plaque formation in mice treated with a small molecule inhibitor targeting the discoidal HDL complex compared to control animals. Furthermore, we found that the levels of circulating cholesterol and triglycerides were significantly decreased in the treated mice, suggesting a potential role for the discoidal HDL complex in lipid metabolism regulation. Our findings provide valuable insights into the potential therapeutic targeting of the discoidal HDL complex for the amelioration of atherosclerosis and related cardiovascular diseases.
