prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: ORC. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The Origin Recognition Complex (ORC) is a key player in the initiation of DNA replication in eukaryotic cells. Dysregulation of this protein complex has been implicated in various human diseases, including cancer and neurodegenerative disorders. Recent studies have revealed the involvement of ORC in maintaining genomic stability and its interaction with factors such as the tumor suppressor p53. Furthermore, the dysregulation of ORC has been linked to aberrant cell proliferation and genome instability, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target for various diseases. Understanding the precise molecular mechanisms of ORC function and its regulation may provide novel insights for developing targeted therapies for diseases associated with DNA replication abnormalities.
