prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: HRD1 ubiquitin ligase. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In recent years, substantial progress has been made in elucidating the molecular mechanisms involved in protein degradation. The HRD1 ubiquitin ligase, a key player in the endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation (ERAD) pathway, has emerged as a pivotal regulator of protein turnover. Dysregulation of HRD1 ubiquitin ligase activity has been implicated in various human diseases, including neurodegenerative disorders and metabolic syndromes. Notably, small molecule modulators of HRD1 ubiquitin ligase activity have shown promise as potential therapeutic agents for diseases associated with protein misfolding and aggregation. Furthermore, the identification of novel substrates and interacting partners of HRD1 ubiquitin ligase has expanded our understanding of its diverse biological functions, underscoring the importance of further research into this critical protein complex.
