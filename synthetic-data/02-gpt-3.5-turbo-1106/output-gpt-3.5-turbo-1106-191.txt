prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: IgG2c. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we investigated the role of the IgG2c antibody isotype in the progression of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), a murine model of multiple sclerosis. Our findings revealed a significant increase in the levels of IgG2c in the serum of EAE-affected mice compared to healthy controls. Furthermore, we observed a positive correlation between IgG2c levels and disease severity, as indicated by clinical scores and histopathological analysis of spinal cord tissue. Importantly, depletion of IgG2c using a specific monoclonal antibody led to a reduction in disease progression and amelioration of EAE pathology. These results provide valuable insights into the involvement of the IgG2c protein complex in the pathogenesis of EAE and suggest its potential as a target for therapeutic intervention in multiple sclerosis.
