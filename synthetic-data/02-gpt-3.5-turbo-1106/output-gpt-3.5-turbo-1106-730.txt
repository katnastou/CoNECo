prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: AHAS I. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The AHAS I protein complex is a key player in the biosynthetic pathway of branched-chain amino acids, such as valine, leucine, and isoleucine. Dysregulation of AHAS I has been linked to a range of disorders, including maple syrup urine disease, a rare inherited metabolic disorder characterized by the inability to metabolize leucine, isoleucine, and valine. Given its central role in amino acid biosynthesis, AHAS I has emerged as a potential therapeutic target for metabolic disorders and certain cancers that rely on dysregulated amino acid metabolism for growth and survival. Further elucidation of the structure and function of AHAS I may pave the way for novel pharmacological interventions aimed at restoring metabolic balance in disease states.
