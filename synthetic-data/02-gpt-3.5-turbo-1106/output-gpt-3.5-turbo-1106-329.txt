prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: VBC. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we investigated the role of the VBC protein complex in the development and progression of colorectal cancer. Utilizing a combination of in vitro and in vivo assays, we demonstrated that the VBC complex is crucial for regulating the stability of hypoxia-inducible factor 1-alpha (HIF-1α), a key transcription factor implicated in tumor angiogenesis and metastasis. Our findings reveal that dysregulation of the VBC complex is associated with increased HIF-1α levels and promotes tumor growth in mouse xenograft models. Furthermore, analysis of patient samples confirmed a significant correlation between VBC expression and advanced stages of colorectal cancer. These results provide valuable insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying colorectal cancer progression and highlight the potential of targeting the VBC complex as a therapeutic strategy for this devastating disease.
