prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: Fibrin. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: Recent studies have highlighted the crucial role of the Fibrin protein complex in the pathogenesis of thrombotic diseases. These diseases, including deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism, are characterized by the abnormal formation of blood clots in the vasculature. Dysregulation of the Fibrin complex has been implicated in the excessive clotting observed in conditions such as disseminated intravascular coagulation and thrombotic microangiopathies. The interaction of Fibrin with other coagulation factors, such as thrombin and factor XIII, contributes to the stability and propagation of the clot. Targeting the Fibrin complex using anticoagulant agents has shown promise in the prevention and treatment of thrombotic disorders. Further elucidation of the mechanistic details of Fibrin complex function may pave the way for the development of more effective therapeutic strategies for managing thrombotic diseases.
