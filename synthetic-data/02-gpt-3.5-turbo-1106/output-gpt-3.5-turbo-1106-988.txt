prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: IgE immunoglobulin. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In the context of allergic reactions, the IgE immunoglobulin plays a central role in mediating the inflammatory response. Upon exposure to specific allergens, IgE immunoglobulin molecules bind to their corresponding high-affinity receptors on the surface of mast cells and basophils, leading to the activation of these immune effector cells. This triggers the release of inflammatory mediators such as histamine, leukotrienes, and cytokines, promoting vasodilation, smooth muscle contraction, and increased vascular permeability. Consequently, these events result in the characteristic symptoms of allergies, including itching, rhinorrhea, bronchoconstriction, and systemic anaphylaxis. Given the pivotal role of IgE immunoglobulin in allergic processes, targeting this complex has been an area of intense research for the development of therapeutic strategies to alleviate allergic symptoms and improve clinical outcomes in patients with allergies.
