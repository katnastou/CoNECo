model: gpt-3.5-turbo-1106
prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: WRC. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The regulation of actin polymerization is essential for various cellular processes, including cell migration, adhesion, and motility. The WRC (WAVE regulatory complex) plays a critical role in the control of actin dynamics by activating the Arp2/3 complex, thereby promoting the nucleation and branching of actin filaments. Dysregulation of the WRC has been implicated in various diseases, such as cancer and neurodevelopmental disorders. In addition, small molecule inhibitors targeting the WRC have shown promise in preclinical models for controlling cancer cell invasion and metastasis. Understanding the molecular mechanisms governing the activity of WRC and its potential therapeutic implications is an important area of research in biomedical science.
