prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: MTREC. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In recent years, there has been increasing interest in understanding the role of the MTREC protein complex in the pathogenesis of various hematological malignancies, including acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). The MTREC complex has been shown to play a crucial role in the post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression by mediating the recognition and degradation of aberrant pre-mRNA transcripts. Dysregulation of MTREC complex activity has been implicated in the aberrant splicing events observed in malignant hematopoietic cells, leading to the generation of abnormal protein isoforms that drive oncogenic transformation. Targeting the MTREC complex represents a promising therapeutic strategy for the treatment of hematological malignancies, and further research is warranted to elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying its dysregulation in cancer.
