prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: Isw1a. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The chromatin remodeling complex Isw1a has been identified as a critical mediator of gene regulation in multiple organisms. Recent studies have implicated Isw1a in the maintenance of genome stability and the regulation of DNA replication and repair processes. Dysregulation of Isw1a has been associated with various human diseases, including cancer and neurological disorders. Furthermore, the interaction of Isw1a with other chromatin remodeling complexes and epigenetic modifiers has underscored its significance in the orchestration of gene expression patterns. The potential implications of Isw1a dysregulation in disease pathogenesis highlight the need for further investigation into its cellular functions and therapeutic targeting strategies.
