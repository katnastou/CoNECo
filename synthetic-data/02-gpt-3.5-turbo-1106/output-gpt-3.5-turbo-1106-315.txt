prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: cytoplasmic dynein heavy chain. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we investigated the interaction between cytoplasmic dynein heavy chain and the microtubule cytoskeleton in the context of Alzheimer's disease. We utilized an in vitro model system to examine the effects of amyloid beta oligomers on the binding affinity and kinetics of cytoplasmic dynein heavy chain to microtubules. Our results suggest that amyloid beta oligomers disrupt the association of cytoplasmic dynein heavy chain with microtubules, leading to impaired axonal transport and neurodegeneration. This finding highlights the potential role of cytoplasmic dynein in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease and underscores the importance of exploring therapeutic strategies targeting this protein complex for the treatment of neurodegenerative disorders.
