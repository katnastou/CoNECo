prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: inhibin B. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In the current study, we investigated the relationship between inhibin B levels and polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) in a cohort of 150 premenopausal women. Inhibin B, a member of the TGF-Î² superfamily, is chiefly produced by the ovarian granulosa cells and serves as a direct marker of ovarian reserve and function. Our results demonstrated a significant negative correlation between inhibin B levels and the presence of PCOS, with lower levels observed in affected individuals compared to healthy controls (p<0.05). Furthermore, multivariate regression analysis revealed that inhibin B levels were independently associated with PCOS after adjusting for potential confounders. These findings suggest that inhibin B may serve as a promising biomarker for the early diagnosis and monitoring of PCOS in clinical practice.
