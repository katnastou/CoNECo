prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: IL15 receptor. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we investigated the effects of Interleukin 15 (IL15) on the IL15 receptor in a murine model of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). We found that the administration of IL15 led to a significant upregulation of the IL15 receptor in the inflamed intestinal tissue of mice with IBD. Additionally, we observed a correlation between the expression levels of IL15 and the severity of colitis, suggesting a potential role for the IL15 receptor in the pathogenesis of IBD. Our findings indicate that targeting the IL15 receptor may hold promise as a therapeutic strategy for managing IBD and related inflammatory conditions. Further research is needed to elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying the interaction between IL15 and the IL15 receptor and to validate the potential of IL15 receptor modulation as a treatment approach for IBD.
