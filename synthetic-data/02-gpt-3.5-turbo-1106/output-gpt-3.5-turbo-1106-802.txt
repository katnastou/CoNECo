prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: ThiGH. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In recent years, there has been significant interest in unveiling the mechanistic details underlying the involvement of the ThiGH protein complex in bacterial pathogenesis. It is well established that ThiGH has a crucial role in thiamine biosynthesis, with perturbations in its activity linked to thiamine deficiency disorders. However, emerging evidence suggests that ThiGH may also modulate bacterial virulence through its interaction with various metabolic pathways and regulatory networks. Utilizing a combination of genetic, biochemical, and structural approaches, researchers aim to elucidate the precise molecular interplay between ThiGH and key pathogenic determinants, providing valuable insights for the development of novel antimicrobial strategies targeting this essential protein complex.
