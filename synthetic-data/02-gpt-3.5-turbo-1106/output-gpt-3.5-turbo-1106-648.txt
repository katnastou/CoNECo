prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: MukBEF condensin. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The MukBEF condensin protein complex is a vital component in the maintenance of chromosome structure and segregation in Escherichia coli bacteria. Recent studies have elucidated the essential role of MukBEF condensin in regulating the compaction and organization of the bacterial chromosome during cell division. Furthermore, disruption of the MukBEF condensin complex has been linked to aberrant chromosomal segregation and the development of aneuploidy in E. coli, leading to impaired cell viability and increased susceptibility to environmental stressors. These findings underscore the significance of understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying the function of the MukBEF condensin complex in bacterial physiology and its potential implications for the pathogenesis of infectious diseases. Additionally, exploring the therapeutic potential of targeting MukBEF condensin could offer new strategies for combating antibiotic-resistant E. coli infections.
