prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: 5HT3-A receptor. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: Our study investigated the role of the 5HT3-A receptor in chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV) in cancer patients. We conducted a double-blind, randomized clinical trial to assess the efficacy of a novel antagonist targeting the 5HT3-A receptor in preventing CINV in a cohort of 200 breast cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy. Patients receiving the antagonist treatment demonstrated a significant reduction in the frequency and severity of nausea and vomiting compared to the control group. Additionally, we observed a decrease in the release of serotonin and dopamine in the brainstem following chemotherapy administration in the antagonist-treated group, indicating a potential mechanism through which the 5HT3-A receptor modulates CINV. These findings suggest that targeting the 5HT3-A receptor may offer a promising approach to mitigating CINV in cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy.
