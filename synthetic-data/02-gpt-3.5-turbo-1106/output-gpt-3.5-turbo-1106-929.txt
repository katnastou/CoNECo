prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: sgaTBA. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we investigated the role of the sgaTBA protein complex in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease. Using a transgenic mouse model of Alzheimer's disease, we observed a significant upregulation of sgaTBA in the brain tissue of affected animals. Further analysis revealed a potential correlation between sgaTBA levels and amyloid-beta plaque accumulation, a hallmark of Alzheimer's disease pathology. To confirm the involvement of sgaTBA in disease progression, we administered a novel small molecule inhibitor targeting sgaTBA in the transgenic mice. Notably, treatment with the sgaTBA inhibitor led to a reduction in amyloid-beta plaque deposition and an improvement in cognitive function, suggesting that sgaTBA may serve as a potential therapeutic target for treating Alzheimer's disease. Our findings highlight the significance of sgaTBA in the context of neurodegenerative diseases and warrant further investigation into the mechanistic role of sgaTBA in Alzheimer's disease.
