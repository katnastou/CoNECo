prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: GIMC. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In recent years, the discovery of the GIMC protein complex has garnered significant attention in the field of mitochondrial biology. Studies have revealed its crucial role in regulating energy metabolism and maintaining mitochondrial integrity. The complex has been implicated in various metabolic disorders, including mitochondrial encephalopathy and Leigh syndrome. Furthermore, the interaction of GIMC with certain small molecule inhibitors has emerged as a potential avenue for therapeutic intervention in mitochondrial dysfunction. Despite these promising findings, further investigation is warranted to elucidate the exact mechanisms underlying the function of the GIMC complex and its potential as a therapeutic target for metabolic disorders.
