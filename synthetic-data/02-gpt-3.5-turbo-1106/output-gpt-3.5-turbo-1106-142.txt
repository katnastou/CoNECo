prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: GimC. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we investigated the role of the GimC protein complex in the regulation of cellular metabolism in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Through a series of experiments, we found that the expression levels of certain metabolic enzymes were significantly altered in yeast strains lacking a functional GimC complex. Furthermore, using mass spectrometry analysis, we identified specific interactions between GimC and key metabolites involved in glucose and lipid metabolism. These findings suggest that the GimC complex plays a critical role in the coordination of metabolic pathways in yeast cells. Understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying the function of the GimC complex may provide insights into potential therapeutic targets for metabolic disorders in humans.
