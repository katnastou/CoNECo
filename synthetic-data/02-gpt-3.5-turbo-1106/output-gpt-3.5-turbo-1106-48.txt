prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: Nup84. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we investigated the role of the Nup84 protein complex in the regulation of cellular processes. Through a series of experiments using the model organism Saccharomyces cerevisiae, we demonstrated the association between Nup84 and the nuclear pore complex. Our results indicate that mutations in Nup84 are associated with impaired nuclear transport and increased susceptibility to DNA damage. Furthermore, we identified a chemical compound that modulates the activity of Nup84, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target for diseases characterized by disrupted nucleocytoplasmic transport. These findings provide valuable insights into the functional significance of the Nup84 protein complex and its implications for human health.
