prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: COMPASS. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The chromatin modifying complex known as COMPASS has been the subject of extensive investigation due to its crucial role in regulating gene expression. Recent studies have shown that COMPASS is associated with a variety of cellular processes, including DNA repair, genomic stability, and development. Dysregulation of COMPASS has been linked to various human diseases, such as cancer and neurological disorders, highlighting its importance in maintaining normal cellular function. Furthermore, the identification of small molecule inhibitors targeting COMPASS has provided new avenues for therapeutic intervention in diseases associated with dysregulated gene expression. Understanding the precise mechanisms by which COMPASS functions is essential for the development of targeted therapies aimed at ameliorating the impact of its dysregulation in human health.
