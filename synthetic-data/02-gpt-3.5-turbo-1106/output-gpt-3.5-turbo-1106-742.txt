prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: SsuE. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: A critical interaction has been identified between the SsuE protein complex and the substrate-binding protein NuoM in the context of sulfur metabolism in Escherichia coli. This interaction has been shown to be crucial for the efficient utilization of sulfate as a sulfur source by the bacterium. Further investigation revealed that the SsuE complex is also involved in the regulation of key enzymes in the cysteine biosynthesis pathway, highlighting its central role in sulfur homeostasis. These findings shed light on the intricate network of molecular interactions underlying sulfur metabolism in bacteria, offering potential targets for the development of novel antimicrobial strategies. Understanding the dynamics of the SsuE complex and its interplay with other cellular components may provide valuable insights into the pathogenesis of sulfur-related diseases and the design of targeted therapeutic interventions.
