prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: FcaRI. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we investigated the role of FcaRI in the pathogenesis of allergic diseases. We analyzed the interaction between FcaRI and IgE antibodies in patients with allergic rhinitis and asthma. Our results showed a significant upregulation of FcaRI expression in the nasal mucosa and bronchial tissues of allergic individuals compared to healthy controls. Furthermore, we observed a positive correlation between FcaRI levels and disease severity, indicating a potential involvement of FcaRI in the development and progression of allergic disorders. These findings shed light on the molecular mechanisms underlying allergic responses and highlight FcaRI as a potential target for therapeutic interventions in allergic diseases.
