prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: HCN1 channel. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The HCN1 channel is a crucial component in the regulation of neuronal excitability and pacemaker activity in the heart. In this study, we investigated the impact of HCN1 channel dysfunction on the development of epileptic seizures in a murine model. By utilizing HCN1 knockout mice, we found that the absence of functional HCN1 channels led to a significant increase in seizure susceptibility in response to chemically-induced convulsant agents. Furthermore, we observed alterations in the expression levels of key neurotransmitters in the hippocampus of HCN1-deficient mice, suggesting a potential role for HCN1 channels in modulating neurotransmission. This research sheds light on the significance of HCN1 channels in the pathophysiology of epilepsy and provides insights into potential therapeutic targets for the treatment of epilepsy associated with HCN1 channel dysfunction.
