prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: DPD. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPD) protein complex plays a crucial role in the metabolism of fluoropyrimidines, such as 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), which is commonly used for the treatment of various types of cancer. Deficiency in DPD activity has been associated with severe 5-FU toxicity in patients, leading to potentially life-threatening adverse drug reactions. Studies have shown that alterations in DPD function can result from genetic polymorphisms, environmental factors, and interactions with concomitant medications. Understanding the complex interplay of DPD with other enzymes and cellular pathways involved in fluoropyrimidine metabolism is essential for improving the safety and efficacy of 5-FU-based cancer therapies. This knowledge could also have implications for personalized medicine approaches and the development of novel strategies to mitigate 5-FU-related toxicities in clinical settings.
