prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: M-calpain. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The role of M-calpain in neurodegenerative diseases has attracted significant attention in recent research. M-calpain, a calcium-dependent cysteine protease, has been implicated in the regulation of various cellular processes, including cellular differentiation, apoptosis, and cytoskeletal remodeling. In Alzheimer's disease, enhanced M-calpain activity has been observed, leading to the proteolysis of key cytoskeletal and signaling proteins, contributing to neuronal damage. Additionally, studies have indicated that M-calpain may play a role in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease, with dysregulation of M-calpain activity implicated in protein aggregation and neuroinflammation. Understanding the precise mechanisms by which M-calpain contributes to neurodegeneration may provide novel insights for the development of targeted therapeutic interventions.
