prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: Mis12. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The Mis12 protein complex plays a crucial role in maintaining genomic stability and proper chromosome segregation during cell division. It has been shown to interact with the Ndc80 complex, another key player in the dynamic process of kinetochore-microtubule attachment. Dysregulation of the Mis12 complex has been implicated in various human diseases, including certain types of cancer and developmental disorders. Furthermore, recent studies have revealed the involvement of the Mis12 complex in modulating the response to anti-mitotic chemotherapeutic agents, highlighting its potential as a target for therapeutic interventions in cancer treatment. Understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying the function of the Mis12 complex may open up new avenues for the development of targeted therapies aimed at disrupting the aberrant cell division processes characteristic of numerous pathological conditions.
