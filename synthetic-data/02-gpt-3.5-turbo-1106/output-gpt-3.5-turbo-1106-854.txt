prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: BRISC. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In recent years, the role of BRISC in inflammatory responses has garnered significant attention in the field of immunology. Studies have revealed a crucial link between BRISC and the regulation of immune signaling pathways, particularly in the context of inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis and inflammatory bowel disease. The intricate interplay between BRISC and key regulatory proteins, including NF-kB and TNF-alpha, has underscored the importance of BRISC in modulating immune responses. Given its pivotal role in maintaining immune homeostasis, BRISC has emerged as a promising therapeutic target for the development of novel interventions aimed at mitigating chronic inflammatory conditions. Further exploration of the molecular mechanisms underlying the function of BRISC is warranted to elucidate its full potential in the treatment of inflammatory disorders.
