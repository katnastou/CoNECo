prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: SapABCDF. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The SapABCDF protein complex is known to play a critical role in the virulence of Staphylococcus aureus, a pathogenic bacteria responsible for a wide variety of infections in humans. Recent studies have revealed the involvement of SapABCDF in the mechanism of resistance to antimicrobial agents commonly used in clinical settings. This finding highlights the potential of SapABCDF as a target for novel therapeutic strategies against Staphylococcus aureus infections, particularly in the context of multidrug-resistant strains. Understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying the function of SapABCDF could provide important insights into the development of more effective treatment options for combating Staphylococcus aureus infections and improving patient outcomes.
