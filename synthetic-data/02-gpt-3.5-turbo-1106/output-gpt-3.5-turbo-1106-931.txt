prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: interleukin-23 receptor. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The role of interleukin-23 receptor in the pathogenesis of psoriatic arthritis has been a subject of extensive investigation. A recent study conducted in a murine model demonstrated that the binding of interleukin-23 to its receptor triggers a series of downstream signaling events, leading to the activation of Th17 cells and the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Furthermore, genetic knockout of the interleukin-23 receptor was shown to ameliorate the development of arthritis symptoms in the animal model. These findings provide valuable insights into the potential therapeutic targeting of the interleukin-23 receptor for the treatment of psoriatic arthritis and other related autoimmune diseases.
