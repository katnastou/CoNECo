prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: 5-HT3AR. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: Recent studies have focused on the role of the 5-HT3AR protein complex in the development of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV) in cancer patients. Activation of the 5-HT3AR complex by serotonin has been implicated in triggering the emetic response in the central nervous system. Antagonists targeting the 5-HT3AR complex, such as ondansetron and granisetron, have been widely used to alleviate CINV. However, the efficacy of these antagonists varies among patients, suggesting potential genetic and environmental factors influencing 5-HT3AR function. Understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying 5-HT3AR-mediated signaling pathways could provide insights into individual differences in CINV susceptibility and pave the way for personalized therapeutic approaches in cancer care.
