model: gpt-3.5-turbo-1106
prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: gammaTuSCs. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: A growing body of evidence implicates the gammaTuSCs in the regulation of microtubule nucleation, a critical process in the organization of the cytoskeleton. Dysfunction of the gammaTuSCs has been associated with a range of cellular phenotypes, including impaired mitotic spindle formation and abnormal cell division. Moreover, the interaction between gammaTuSCs and regulatory proteins suggests a role for these complexes in cellular signaling pathways. Given their essential functions, exploring the therapeutic potential of targeting gammaTuSCs in diseases characterized by aberrant microtubule dynamics, such as certain types of cancer and neurodegenerative disorders, is a topic of increasing interest in biomedical research.
