prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: IL7 receptor. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The Interleukin-7 receptor (IL7 receptor) plays a crucial role in the regulation of lymphocyte development and homeostasis. Dysregulation of IL7 receptor signaling has been implicated in various immune-related disorders, including autoimmune diseases and lymphoproliferative disorders. The IL7 receptor is composed of two subunits, IL7Rα and common gamma chain (γc), which are both integral for functional receptor signaling. Upon binding to its ligand, IL7, the receptor activates a cascade of downstream signaling events involved in cell proliferation, survival, and differentiation. Given its importance in immune cell regulation, the IL7 receptor represents an attractive therapeutic target for the treatment of immune-related disorders. Further understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying IL7 receptor signaling may provide valuable insights for the development of novel therapeutic strategies targeting this pivotal pathway.
