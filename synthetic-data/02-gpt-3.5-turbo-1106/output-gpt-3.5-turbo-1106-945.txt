prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: IL-23 receptor. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The IL-23 receptor has been implicated in the pathogenesis of several autoimmune diseases, including psoriasis, rheumatoid arthritis, and Crohn's disease. The IL-23 receptor plays a critical role in regulating the differentiation and maintenance of TH17 cells, which are associated with the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Targeting the IL-23 receptor has emerged as a promising therapeutic strategy for mitigating the inflammatory responses associated with these diseases. Various small molecule inhibitors and monoclonal antibodies directed against the IL-23 receptor have shown efficacy in preclinical and clinical studies, highlighting the potential for IL-23 receptor modulation as a valuable therapeutic approach for autoimmune disorders. Further research into the precise signaling mechanisms and downstream effects of IL-23 receptor blockade is warranted to fully elucidate its therapeutic potential.
