prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: NendoUs. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In the present study, we investigated the role of the NendoUs protein complex in the pathogenesis of human liver disease. Our findings demonstrate that the dysregulation of NendoUs is associated with the accumulation of toxic metabolites, leading to liver cell damage and oxidative stress. Furthermore, we observed a significant decrease in NendoUs activity in patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, suggesting a potential therapeutic target for this prevalent condition. Our results open new avenues for the development of innovative treatments aimed at modulating NendoUs function to mitigate liver damage and improve patient outcomes. These findings shed light on the importance of NendoUs in liver homeostasis and its implications for the management of hepatic disorders.
