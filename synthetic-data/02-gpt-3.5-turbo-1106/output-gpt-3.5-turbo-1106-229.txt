prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: TOB. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: Our study investigated the role of the TOB protein complex in the pathogenesis of colorectal cancer. We utilized patient tissue samples and a mouse model to examine the expression and localization of TOB in tumor tissues compared to healthy adjacent tissues. Our findings revealed a significant upregulation of TOB in tumor cells, particularly in aggressive metastatic stages of the disease. Furthermore, we observed a correlation between TOB expression and the activation of key signaling pathways associated with cancer progression. This suggests that the TOB protein complex may play a crucial role in promoting the aggressiveness of colorectal cancer. Our results provide important insights into the potential targeting of TOB for therapeutic interventions in colorectal cancer.
