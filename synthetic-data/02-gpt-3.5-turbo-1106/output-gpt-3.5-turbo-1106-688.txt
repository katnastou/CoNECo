prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: PRC2.1. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The Polycomb Repressive Complex 2.1 (PRC2.1) is a pivotal regulator of gene expression that plays a crucial role in various biological processes, particularly in the context of development and disease. Recent studies have demonstrated the involvement of PRC2.1 in the pathogenesis of numerous conditions, including cancer and developmental disorders. The catalytic activity of PRC2.1, which mediates histone methylation, has been shown to exert significant influence on gene silencing and chromatin conformation, thereby contributing to the maintenance of cell identity and tissue homeostasis. Dysregulation of PRC2.1 has been implicated in aberrant cellular proliferation and differentiation, underscoring its potential as a therapeutic target in various pathological conditions. Further elucidation of the molecular mechanisms governing PRC2.1 function and its interactions with other cellular components holds promise for the development of novel interventions aimed at modulating its activity and ameliorating associated pathological states.
