prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: RNAPII. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we investigated the role of the RNAPII protein complex in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease. Using a transgenic mouse model expressing mutant amyloid precursor protein, we observed a significant upregulation of RNAPII activity in the hippocampus, a key brain region affected by Alzheimer's disease. Furthermore, treatment with a GSK3Î² inhibitor resulted in decreased RNAPII phosphorylation and improved cognitive function in these mice. Our findings provide novel insights into the involvement of RNAPII in the molecular pathways underlying Alzheimer's disease and suggest that targeting RNAPII activity may hold promise for therapeutic interventions in this neurodegenerative disorder.
