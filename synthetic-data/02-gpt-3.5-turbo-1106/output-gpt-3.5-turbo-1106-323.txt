prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: HDL. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: High-density lipoprotein (HDL) has long been recognized for its crucial role in cardiovascular health, primarily due to its ability to mediate reverse cholesterol transport and promote the efflux of cholesterol from peripheral tissues. However, recent research has revealed a broader spectrum of functional activities for HDL beyond its canonical cholesterol transport function. Studies have implicated HDL in anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and antithrombotic processes, and suggested its potential utility as a biomarker and therapeutic target for cardiovascular diseases, such as atherosclerosis and coronary artery disease. Moreover, numerous epidemiological and clinical studies have highlighted an inverse correlation between HDL levels and the risk of developing cardiovascular pathologies, underscoring the significance of further understanding the multifaceted roles of HDL in health and disease.
