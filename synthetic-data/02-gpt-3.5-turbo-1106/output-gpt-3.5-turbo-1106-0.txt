prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: WASH-C. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The WASH complex (WASH-C) has been implicated in various cellular processes, including endosomal trafficking and actin cytoskeleton regulation. This protein complex is composed of multiple subunits and is known to interact with a diverse array of proteins, including retromer and the ARP2/3 complex. Dysregulation of WASH-C has been linked to various pathological conditions, such as neurodevelopmental disorders and cancer metastasis. Understanding the precise molecular mechanisms and signaling pathways involved in WASH-C function is crucial for identifying potential therapeutic targets in the treatment of these diseases. Additionally, the role of WASH-C in modulating cellular dynamics highlights its potential as a promising target for drug development and intervention strategies.
