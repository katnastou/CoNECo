prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: Prothrombinase. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we investigated the role of the protein complex Prothrombinase in the pathogenesis of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). We utilized an in vivo murine model of DIC to elucidate the contribution of Prothrombinase to the coagulation cascade. Our results demonstrated a significant upregulation of Prothrombinase activity in DIC-affected mice, suggesting a potential link between this protein complex and the hypercoagulable state observed in this disease. Furthermore, we identified potential therapeutic targets downstream of Prothrombinase, which may offer novel strategies for intervention in DIC. Overall, our findings provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying the pathophysiology of DIC and may pave the way for the development of targeted treatments for this life-threatening condition.
