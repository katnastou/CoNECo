prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: HslVU protease. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: Recent studies have shown that the HslVU protease plays a crucial role in the regulation of proteostasis in various organisms, including humans. Dysfunction of the HslVU protease has been implicated in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease. Furthermore, the HslVU protease has been found to interact with various small molecule inhibitors, providing potential targets for therapeutic intervention. Understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying the function of the HslVU protease in disease states may lead to the development of novel therapeutic strategies for the treatment of proteostasis-related disorders.
