prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: GET. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The Golgi ER trafficking (GET) complex is a key player in the regulation of protein transport between the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and the Golgi apparatus. Recent studies have implicated the GET complex in the pathogenesis of certain neurodegenerative diseases, including Parkinson's disease. Additionally, dysregulation of the GET complex has been linked to the development of certain types of cancer, such as pancreatic cancer. These findings highlight the importance of further investigating the role of the GET complex in disease progression and its potential as a therapeutic target. Moreover, the GET complex's involvement in cellular homeostasis underscores its relevance in the development of novel treatments for a range of human disorders.
