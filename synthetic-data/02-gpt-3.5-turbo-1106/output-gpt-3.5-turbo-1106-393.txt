prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: cullin-RING ligase 3. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: Cullin-RING ligase 3 (CRL3) is a key regulator of cellular homeostasis and is involved in the degradation of various substrates through the ubiquitin-proteasome system. Dysregulation of CRL3 has been implicated in the pathogenesis of several human diseases, including cancer and neurodegenerative disorders. The activity of CRL3 is tightly controlled by post-translational modifications and interactions with adaptor proteins, which modulate substrate specificity and stability. Small molecule inhibitors targeting the activity of CRL3 have shown promising therapeutic potential in preclinical models of cancer and other diseases. Further elucidation of the molecular mechanisms governing the function of CRL3 will provide valuable insights for the development of novel therapeutic strategies targeting this critical protein complex.
