prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: Adenosylcobalamin-dependent ethanolamine ammonia-lyase. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In recent years, the role of the Adenosylcobalamin-dependent ethanolamine ammonia-lyase (EAL) complex in certain metabolic processes has garnered significant interest. Studies have revealed its crucial involvement in the catabolism of ethanolamine, a critical step in the synthesis of choline and phospholipids in mammals. Furthermore, investigations into EAL-related disorders, such as ethanolamine metabolism disorders and associated neurological manifestations, have provided valuable insights into the physiological importance of this protein complex. The elucidation of EAL's molecular mechanisms and regulatory pathways has advanced our understanding of its essential functions in human health and disease. These findings hold promise for the development of novel therapeutic approaches targeting EAL-related disorders.
