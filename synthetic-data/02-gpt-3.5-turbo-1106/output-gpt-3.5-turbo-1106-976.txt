prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: EAL. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The EAL protein complex has garnered significant attention in recent studies of bacterial pathogenesis. It has been shown to play a crucial role in modulating the cellular levels of cyclic di-GMP, a key signaling molecule associated with bacterial virulence and biofilm formation. Various strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, a common pathogen implicated in nosocomial infections, have been found to exhibit altered virulence and biofilm-forming abilities upon genetic manipulation of EAL expression. Furthermore, the presence of EAL has been linked to the development of chronic P. aeruginosa infections in patients with cystic fibrosis, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target. Understanding the molecular mechanisms governing EAL activity may offer valuable insights into the pathogenesis of bacterial infections, paving the way for the development of novel antimicrobial strategies.
