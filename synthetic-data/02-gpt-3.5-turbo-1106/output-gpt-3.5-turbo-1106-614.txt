prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: npBAF. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The role of the npBAF protein complex in neurodevelopmental disorders has been an area of active investigation. Recent studies have reported an association between disruptions in npBAF and the pathogenesis of intellectual disability, autism spectrum disorders, and other cognitive impairments. This protein complex is known to play critical roles in the regulation of gene expression and chromatin remodeling processes, which are essential for proper neuronal development and synaptic function. Dysregulation of npBAF has been linked to alterations in synaptic plasticity, which may contribute to the cognitive deficits observed in affected individuals. Understanding the mechanisms underlying npBAF dysfunction and its impact on neurodevelopmental disorders could lead to the development of novel therapeutic strategies targeting this protein complex.
