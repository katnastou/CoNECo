prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: SAT-OASS. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In recent years, the role of sulfur amino acid metabolism in the etiology of various diseases has garnered significant attention. The sulfur aminotransferase- O-acetylserine(thiol)lyase (SAT-OASS) complex, which catalyzes the final step in cysteine biosynthesis, has been implicated in the pathogenesis of several metabolic disorders, including diabetes and cardiovascular diseases. Previous studies have demonstrated the crucial interplay between SAT-OASS and cellular redox homeostasis, suggesting potential implications for oxidative stress-related pathologies. Furthermore, it has been proposed that dysregulation of SAT-OASS activity may contribute to the progression of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's. Therefore, elucidating the mechanisms governing SAT-OASS function may offer promising avenues for therapeutic interventions targeting these debilitating conditions.
