prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: C1q. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In recent years, there has been growing interest in the role of the C1q protein complex in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases, particularly Alzheimer's disease. C1q is a key component of the classical complement pathway and has been implicated in the modulation of synapse pruning and microglial activation in the central nervous system. Studies have provided evidence suggesting that C1q may play a pivotal role in the progression of neuroinflammation and synaptic dysfunction in Alzheimer's disease. Furthermore, research has highlighted the potential therapeutic implications of targeting the C1q complex in mitigating neurodegenerative processes. As our understanding of the multifaceted roles of C1q continues to evolve, it presents a promising avenue for the development of novel interventions aimed at ameliorating the impact of Alzheimer's disease and related neurodegenerative disorders.
