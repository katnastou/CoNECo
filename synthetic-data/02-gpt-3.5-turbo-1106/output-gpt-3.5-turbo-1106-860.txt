prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: PGGTase-I. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we investigated the role of the PGGTase-I protein complex in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular disease. We used a murine model of atherosclerosis to assess the impact of PGGTase-I inhibition on disease progression. Our results demonstrate a significant reduction in atherosclerotic plaque formation in mice treated with a specific PGGTase-I inhibitor compared to control animals. Furthermore, we observed a decrease in plasma levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines in the treated group, indicating a potential anti-inflammatory effect of PGGTase-I inhibition. These findings suggest that targeting the PGGTase-I protein complex may represent a promising therapeutic strategy for mitigating atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease.
