prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: Hydrogenase 3. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: A key player in microbial energy metabolism, Hydrogenase 3 has been the subject of intense study in recent years. This protein complex has been found to play a critical role in various microorganisms' ability to utilize molecular hydrogen as an energy source. The enzymatic activity of Hydrogenase 3 has been linked to important biological processes, including the production of molecular hydrogen, the reduction of protons, and the generation of a proton motive force. Understanding the structure, function, and regulation of Hydrogenase 3 has significant implications for our knowledge of microbial physiology and bioenergetics. Moreover, the potential applications of Hydrogenase 3 in biohydrogen production and bioremediation make it an attractive target for further investigation and exploitation.
