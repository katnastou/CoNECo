prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: TOM. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The translocase of the outer mitochondrial membrane (TOM) protein complex is integral in the import of nuclear-encoded precursor proteins into mitochondria, playing a crucial role in maintaining mitochondrial function. Dysregulation of the TOM complex has been implicated in various human diseases, including neurodegenerative disorders such as Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease. Previous studies have demonstrated the association of TOM complex dysfunction with impaired mitochondrial protein import and subsequent disruption of mitochondrial homeostasis, leading to cellular stress and dysfunction. Thus, understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying TOM complex function is critical for developing potential therapeutic strategies for mitochondrial-related diseases. Furthermore, investigations into the interaction partners and regulatory pathways of the TOM complex may provide valuable insights into its physiological and pathological roles.
