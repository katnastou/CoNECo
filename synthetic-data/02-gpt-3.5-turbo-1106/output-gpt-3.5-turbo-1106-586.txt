prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: DOM-B.C. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In recent studies, the interaction of the protein complex DOM-B.C with the chemical compound X has been shown to have a significant impact on the progression of PathoZ disease. PathoZ, a common debilitating condition affecting a large population, has been linked to dysregulation of cellular processes associated with DOM-B.C. Further investigation into the effects of X on DOM-B.C activity in PathoZ pathogenesis may provide valuable insights into potential therapeutic interventions. Additionally, the role of DOM-B.C in the development and progression of other related diseases warrants further exploration, highlighting the potential for targeting DOM-B.C as a promising avenue for disease management and treatment.
