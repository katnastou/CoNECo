prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: WAVE. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In recent years, the WAVE protein complex has garnered significant attention for its crucial role in the regulation of actin dynamics and cell motility. Studies have demonstrated that dysregulation of the WAVE complex can lead to aberrant cytoskeletal organization and impaired cell migration, with implications for various pathological conditions including cancer metastasis and neurodevelopmental disorders. Moreover, the intricate interplay between the WAVE complex and small GTPases such as Rac1 and Cdc42 underscores its involvement in diverse signaling pathways. Notably, the identification of small molecule inhibitors targeting the WAVE complex has opened new avenues for potential therapeutic interventions in diseases characterized by excessive cell motility and invasion. Understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying the function of the WAVE complex holds promise for the development of innovative strategies to modulate cellular behavior and combat related pathological processes.
