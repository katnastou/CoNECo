prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: BORC. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: BLOC-1-related complex (BORC) is a conserved multi-subunit protein complex involved in intracellular trafficking and organelle biogenesis. Recent studies have demonstrated the crucial role of BORC in the regulation of lysosome positioning and function. Dysregulation of BORC has been implicated in various neurodegenerative disorders, including Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease, as well as in cancer progression. BORC interacts with small GTPases and is responsible for the recruitment of kinesin motors to lysosomes, thereby influencing cellular homeostasis and signaling pathways. Understanding the intricate molecular mechanisms underlying BORC function may provide valuable insights into the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases and potential therapeutic targets for their treatment.
