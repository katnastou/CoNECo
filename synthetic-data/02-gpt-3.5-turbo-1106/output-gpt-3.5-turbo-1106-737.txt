prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: CRL4. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The CRL4 protein complex has been the subject of extensive research due to its critical role in various cellular processes. Previous studies have demonstrated that CRL4 is involved in the regulation of DNA repair and genomic stability, making it a potential target for the development of cancer therapeutics. Recent investigations have also implicated CRL4 in the modulation of cell cycle progression and the maintenance of cellular homeostasis. Furthermore, dysregulation of CRL4 has been associated with various diseases, including neurodegenerative disorders and developmental abnormalities. The elucidation of the molecular mechanisms underlying the function of CRL4 may provide valuable insights for the development of novel therapeutic interventions targeting these complex cellular pathways.
