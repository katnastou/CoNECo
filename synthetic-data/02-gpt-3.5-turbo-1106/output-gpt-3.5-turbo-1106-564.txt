prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: COG. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The conserved oligomeric Golgi (COG) protein complex plays a critical role in intracellular transport and glycosylation processes within eukaryotic cells. Dysregulation or dysfunction of COG has been associated with various human genetic disorders, such as congenital disorders of glycosylation (CDG), where mutations in COG genes lead to impaired protein glycosylation and subsequent functional abnormalities. The COG complex is known to interact with various other Golgi-associated proteins and is required for the proper localization and function of many endogenous glycoproteins. Studies have revealed the potential for small molecule inhibitors of COG to impact glycosylation and the intracellular trafficking of glycoproteins, implicating the COG complex as a potential target for therapeutic interventions in diseases involving aberrant protein glycosylation. This research highlights the importance of understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying COG function and its potential implications for human health and disease.
