prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: MCCC. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The mitochondrial 3-methylcrotonyl-coenzyme A carboxylase (MCCC) is a critical enzyme complex involved in the catabolism of leucine and fatty acids. Deficiency in MCCC activity has been associated with 3-methylcrotonylglycinuria, a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by elevated levels of 3-methylcrotonylglycine in urine and plasma, leading to neurologic and metabolic complications. Previous studies have focused on the genetic basis of MCCC deficiency, while the precise molecular mechanisms underlying disease pathogenesis remain poorly understood. Recent work has implicated dysregulation of beta-oxidation and increased oxidative stress as potential contributors to the pathophysiology of MCCC deficiency. Further elucidation of the molecular pathways involved in MCCC-related pathologies may provide new insights into therapeutic interventions for this rare and debilitating disorder.
