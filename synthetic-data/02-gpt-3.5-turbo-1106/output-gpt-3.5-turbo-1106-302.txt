prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: RNAPI. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we investigated the role of the RNAPI protein complex in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease. We conducted a series of experiments using a transgenic mouse model overexpressing amyloid-Î² peptide, a hallmark feature of Alzheimer's disease. Our results demonstrated a significant upregulation of RNAPI expression in the hippocampus of these mice compared to wild-type controls. Furthermore, we observed a correlation between RNAPI expression levels and cognitive decline in the transgenic mice, suggesting a potential role of RNAPI in the progression of Alzheimer's disease. Subsequent analysis revealed an interaction between RNAPI and beta-amyloid, providing valuable insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying Alzheimer's disease pathology. These findings highlight the potential of targeting RNAPI as a therapeutic strategy for Alzheimer's disease.
