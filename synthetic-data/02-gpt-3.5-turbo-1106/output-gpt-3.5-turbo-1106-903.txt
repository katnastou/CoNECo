prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: interleukin-12 receptor. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we investigated the role of interleukin-12 receptor in the pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis. Our results showed that the expression of interleukin-12 receptor was significantly upregulated in synovial tissue samples obtained from rheumatoid arthritis patients compared to healthy controls. Furthermore, we found a positive correlation between interleukin-12 receptor expression levels and disease severity as assessed by the Disease Activity Score. Moreover, inhibition of interleukin-12 receptor signaling using a specific small molecule inhibitor led to a significant decrease in pro-inflammatory cytokine production in rheumatoid arthritis synovial fluid. These findings highlight the potential of targeting interleukin-12 receptor as a novel therapeutic strategy for rheumatoid arthritis.
