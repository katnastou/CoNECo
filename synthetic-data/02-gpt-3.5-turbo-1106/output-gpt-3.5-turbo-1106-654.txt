prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: IL-35. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we investigated the role of the IL-35 protein complex in the regulation of inflammatory responses in a murine model of rheumatoid arthritis. Our results demonstrate that IL-35 plays a critical role in suppressing the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as TNF-Î± and IL-6, and inhibiting the activation of immune cells, including T cells and macrophages, within the inflamed synovial tissue. Furthermore, administration of a small molecule inhibitor that targets the IL-35 complex led to a significant reduction in disease severity and joint damage in arthritic mice. These findings provide important insights into the potential therapeutic utility of targeting IL-35 in the treatment of inflammatory joint diseases.
