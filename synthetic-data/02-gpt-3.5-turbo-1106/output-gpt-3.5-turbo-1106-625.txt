prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: collagen type I trimer. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The role of the collagen type I trimer in osteogenesis imperfecta, a hereditary connective tissue disorder characterized by bone fragility and susceptibility to fracture, has been the subject of intense research efforts. Studies have investigated the relationship between the collagen type I trimer and the manifestations of this disease, as well as potential therapeutic interventions targeting this protein complex. Furthermore, research has also highlighted the implications of collagen type I trimer dysfunction in other connective tissue disorders, thereby shedding light on its broader biological significance. This area of investigation holds promise for deeper understanding of the pathophysiology of these conditions and the development of targeted therapeutic strategies.
