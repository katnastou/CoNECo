prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: calpain. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In recent years, there has been a growing interest in the role of calpain in various disease states. Calpain, a calcium-dependent protease, has been implicated in the pathogenesis of several neurodegenerative disorders, including Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease. Furthermore, the dysregulation of calpain activity has been associated with skeletal muscle wasting in conditions such as Duchenne muscular dystrophy. Given the wide range of diseases in which calpain is involved, there is a need for further research into the molecular mechanisms underlying its function and dysregulation. Additionally, the identification of specific inhibitors of calpain may hold promise for the development of novel therapeutic strategies for these diseases.
