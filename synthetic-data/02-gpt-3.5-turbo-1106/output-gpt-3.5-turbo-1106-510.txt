prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: SufE. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In recent years, the role of the SufE protein complex in the biogenesis of iron-sulfur clusters has garnered significant attention in the scientific community. Iron-sulfur clusters serve as critical cofactors in a wide range of essential proteins involved in diverse cellular processes. Studies have elucidated the crucial role of SufE in facilitating the assembly and trafficking of iron-sulfur clusters through interaction with SufBCD, enhancing our understanding of iron metabolism in both prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms. Dysregulation of SufE function has been implicated in various human diseases linked to iron homeostasis, such as sideroblastic anemia and neurodegenerative disorders. Given the essential nature of iron-sulfur clusters in cellular function, further investigation into the molecular mechanisms governing SufE activity holds promise for the development of targeted therapies for iron-related pathologies.
