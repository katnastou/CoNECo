prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: methylosome. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In recent years, research on the methylosome has uncovered its critical role in the epigenetic regulation of gene expression. The methylosome is known to catalyze the methylation of histone proteins, leading to altered chromatin structure and subsequent changes in gene transcription. Studies have also implicated the methylosome in various disease processes, including cancer and developmental disorders. Furthermore, investigations into the regulation of methylosome activity have revealed potential therapeutic targets for the treatment of epigenetically-driven diseases. Overall, the emerging understanding of the methylosome's function holds great promise for the development of novel epigenetic-based therapies.
