prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: NADH-Q oxidoreductase. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we investigated the role of NADH-Q oxidoreductase in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease. Using a mouse model, we found that inhibition of NADH-Q oxidoreductase resulted in a significant increase in reactive oxygen species production and mitochondrial dysfunction in dopaminergic neurons. Furthermore, treatment with a specific inhibitor of NADH-Q oxidoreductase led to a dramatic decrease in motor function and an increase in dopaminergic neuron loss in the substantia nigra. Our findings suggest that NADH-Q oxidoreductase dysfunction may play a crucial role in the development and progression of Parkinson's disease. These results provide novel insights into the potential therapeutic targets for the management of Parkinson's disease.
