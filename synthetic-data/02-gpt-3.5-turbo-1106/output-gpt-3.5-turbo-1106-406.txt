model: gpt-3.5-turbo-1106
prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: gamma-tubulin small. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: Recent studies have demonstrated the crucial role of the gamma-tubulin small (γ-TuSC) complex in the organization of the microtubule network in various organisms. The complex is highly conserved across species, including humans, and is essential for proper cell division and intracellular transport. Dysregulation of γ-TuSC has been implicated in a number of diseases, such as cancer and neurodegenerative disorders. Additionally, small molecule inhibitors targeting the complex have shown promise as potential therapeutic agents in the treatment of certain diseases. Further research into the function and regulation of γ-TuSC is warranted to elucidate its precise role in health and disease.
