prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: MutLalpha. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we investigated the role of MutLalpha in hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC), also known as Lynch syndrome. MutLalpha is a crucial component of the DNA mismatch repair pathway, which plays a critical role in maintaining genomic stability. Using a mouse model of HNPCC, we observed a significant decrease in the stability of microsatellite repeats in the absence of functional MutLalpha. Furthermore, we identified a novel small molecule inhibitor targeting MutLalpha, which effectively restored DNA mismatch repair capacity in HNPCC cells. Our findings highlight the potential therapeutic implications of targeting MutLalpha in the context of HNPCC, shedding light on new strategies for the treatment of this devastating disease.
