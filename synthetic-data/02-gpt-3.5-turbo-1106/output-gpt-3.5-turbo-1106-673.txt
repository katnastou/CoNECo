prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: AP-2R. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The AP-2R protein complex has been extensively studied due to its critical role in clathrin-mediated endocytosis, a fundamental process for the internalization of various cell surface receptors and other transmembrane proteins. Numerous studies have implicated AP-2R in the regulation of cell signaling, membrane trafficking, and receptor turnover. Dysregulation of AP-2R has been associated with various pathologies, including neurodegenerative diseases, cancer, and metabolic disorders. Understanding the molecular mechanisms governing the function of AP-2R is crucial for the development of targeted therapeutics aimed at modulating endocytic pathways and mitigating the progression of associated diseases. Further investigation into the structural and functional properties of AP-2R holds promise for elucidating its potential as a molecular target for therapeutic intervention.
