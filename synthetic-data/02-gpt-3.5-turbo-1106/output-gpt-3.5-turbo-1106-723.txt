prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: DDD. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The interaction between the DDD protein complex and cellular processes is of great interest in understanding the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative disorders. Previous studies have implicated the DDD complex in DNA repair and chromatin remodeling, but its role in neuronal health is less clear. In this study, we investigated the potential involvement of the DDD complex in the progression of Alzheimer's disease. Utilizing a transgenic mouse model, we observed a significant upregulation of DDD expression in the hippocampus of affected animals compared to controls. Furthermore, we found a correlation between DDD levels and the accumulation of beta-amyloid plaques, a hallmark of Alzheimer's disease pathology. These findings suggest that the DDD complex may play a crucial role in the molecular mechanisms underlying neurodegenerative diseases and warrant further investigation into its potential as a therapeutic target.
