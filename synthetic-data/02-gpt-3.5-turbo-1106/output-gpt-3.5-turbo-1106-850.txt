prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: yNPC. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we investigated the role of the yNPC protein complex in the regulation of nuclear transport in human cells. We demonstrate that perturbation of the yNPC complex results in abnormal trafficking of macromolecules between the nucleus and cytoplasm, leading to impaired cellular functions. Using advanced imaging techniques and biochemical assays, we show that the integrity of the yNPC complex is crucial for maintaining proper nucleocytoplasmic transport, with implications for cellular homeostasis and disease pathology. Furthermore, we identify potential interacting partners of the yNPC complex, shedding light on its molecular mechanisms and functional significance in health and disease. Our findings provide valuable insights into the fundamental biology of the yNPC complex and suggest potential avenues for therapeutic interventions targeting nuclear transport dysregulation.
