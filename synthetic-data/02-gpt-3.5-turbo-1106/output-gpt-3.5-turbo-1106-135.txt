prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: ABI. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we investigated the regulatory role of the ABI protein complex in the development of lung cancer. We utilized a mouse model to assess the impact of ABI on tumor progression and found that inhibition of the ABI complex led to a significant reduction in tumor growth and metastasis. Further analysis revealed that ABI interacts with key signaling pathways involved in cancer development, such as the Wnt pathway and the PI3K/Akt pathway. Additionally, we observed that the expression of ABI was elevated in human lung cancer tissues compared to normal lung tissues, suggesting a potential role in human cancer development. Our findings highlight the potential of targeting the ABI protein complex as a novel therapeutic approach for lung cancer treatment.
