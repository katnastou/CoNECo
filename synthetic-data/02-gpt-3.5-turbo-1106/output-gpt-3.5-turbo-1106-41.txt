prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: ADDL. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The accumulation of amyloid-β (Aβ) oligomers, particularly the Aβ-derived diffusible ligands (ADDLs), has been implicated in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Studies have demonstrated that ADDLs interact with cellular membranes, leading to disruptions in synaptic function and cognitive impairment. Additionally, the presence of ADDLs in cerebrospinal fluid has been associated with disease progression and severity in AD patients. The role of ADDLs in mediating neurotoxic effects and neuronal loss has drawn attention to the potential for targeting this protein complex as a therapeutic strategy for AD. There is an urgent need for further research to elucidate the mechanistic pathways involving ADDLs and to develop effective interventions for preventing their detrimental effects in AD.
