prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: MCM4/6/7. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The MCM4/6/7 complex plays a crucial role in DNA replication and cell proliferation. Recent studies have highlighted the essential nature of this complex in maintaining genomic stability and integrity. Dysregulation or dysfunction of the MCM4/6/7 complex has been linked to various human diseases, including cancer and developmental disorders. Understanding the precise mechanisms governing the assembly and function of the MCM4/6/7 complex is of great importance for developing targeted therapeutic interventions aimed at modulating its activity. Moreover, the identification of small molecule inhibitors that specifically target the MCM4/6/7 complex represents a promising avenue for novel cancer treatments. Further elucidation of the molecular details of the MCM4/6/7 complex could provide valuable insights into disease pathogenesis and lead to the development of innovative therapies.
