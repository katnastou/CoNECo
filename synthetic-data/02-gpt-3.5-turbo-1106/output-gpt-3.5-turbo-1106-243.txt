prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: Sec6/8. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The Sec6/8 protein complex has been implicated in the regulation of intracellular membrane trafficking in eukaryotic cells. This complex plays a crucial role in the formation and maintenance of the exocyst, a multiprotein complex that mediates the docking and fusion of post-Golgi vesicles with the plasma membrane. Dysregulation of the Sec6/8 complex has been associated with various pathological conditions, including neurodegenerative disorders, such as Alzheimer's disease, and cancer metastasis. Understanding the cellular mechanisms underlying the function of the Sec6/8 complex may provide novel insights into the development of targeted therapeutic strategies for these conditions. Further studies are needed to elucidate the precise molecular interactions and regulatory pathways involving the Sec6/8 complex in health and disease.
