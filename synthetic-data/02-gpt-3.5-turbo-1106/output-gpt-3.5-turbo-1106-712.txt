prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: DNA polymerase III holoenzyme. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The DNA polymerase III holoenzyme, a crucial enzyme complex involved in prokaryotic DNA replication, has been the subject of intense investigation due to its essential role in maintaining genome stability. Recent studies have elucidated the intricate regulatory mechanisms governing the assembly and activity of this multiprotein complex. Furthermore, the interaction of the holoenzyme with small molecule inhibitors has been of particular interest, as these compounds hold promise as potential antimicrobial agents targeting bacterial DNA replication. Understanding the structural and functional properties of the DNA polymerase III holoenzyme sheds light on fundamental processes underlying bacterial proliferation and may inform the development of novel therapeutic strategies against infectious diseases.
