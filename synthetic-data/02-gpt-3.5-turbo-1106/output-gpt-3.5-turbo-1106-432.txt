prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: CDK8 kinase module. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In recent years, the roles of the CDK8 kinase module in various biological processes have become the focus of extensive investigation. This protein complex has been found to play critical regulatory roles in transcriptional processes, cellular proliferation, and differentiation. Furthermore, studies have shown that dysregulation of the CDK8 kinase module is associated with the pathogenesis of several diseases, including various types of cancer. The kinase activity of this module has been linked to the phosphorylation of key signaling proteins, thus impacting numerous cellular pathways. Given its multifaceted functions, further elucidating the mechanisms underlying the activity of the CDK8 kinase module holds significant promise for the development of targeted therapeutic interventions for a range of diseases.
