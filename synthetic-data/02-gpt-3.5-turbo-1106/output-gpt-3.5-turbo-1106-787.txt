prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: BCKADH. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we investigated the role of the BCKADH protein complex in the pathogenesis of maple syrup urine disease, a rare inherited metabolic disorder. We utilized a mouse model carrying a mutation in the BCKADH gene to assess the impact of the protein complex dysfunction on disease progression. Our results revealed that the absence of functional BCKADH complex led to pronounced accumulation of branched-chain amino acids and their corresponding keto acids in the bloodstream and tissues, resulting in severe neurotoxicity and the characteristic maple syrup odor in urine. These findings shed light on the pivotal role of the BCKADH complex in maintaining branched-chain amino acid metabolism and highlight its potential as a therapeutic target for the treatment of maple syrup urine disease.
