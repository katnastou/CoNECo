prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: BC3B. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: This study aimed to investigate the role of the BC3B protein complex in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease. The experimental design involved the use of transgenic mouse models overexpressing mutant amyloid precursor protein and tau protein to mimic the pathology of Alzheimer's disease. Biochemical and immunohistochemical analyses revealed a significant upregulation of BC3B levels in the brains of these transgenic mice compared to wild-type controls. Additionally, treatment with a small molecule inhibitor targeting the BC3B complex led to a reduction in amyloid plaque burden and tau hyperphosphorylation, as well as improvement in cognitive function in the transgenic mice. These findings highlight the potential of BC3B as a novel therapeutic target for Alzheimer's disease and provide a basis for further investigation into its molecular mechanisms and downstream signaling pathways.
