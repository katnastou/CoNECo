prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: GT-AG spliceosome. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The GT-AG spliceosome is a critical molecular machinery involved in the processing of pre-mRNA in eukaryotic cells. Dysregulation of the GT-AG spliceosome has been implicated in a variety of human diseases, including spinal muscular atrophy and certain subtypes of leukemia. Recent studies have highlighted the potential of small molecule inhibitors targeting specific components of the GT-AG spliceosome as a novel therapeutic strategy for these diseases. Further research into the structural and functional properties of the GT-AG spliceosome will enhance our understanding of its role in disease pathogenesis and may lead to the development of innovative treatment approaches.
