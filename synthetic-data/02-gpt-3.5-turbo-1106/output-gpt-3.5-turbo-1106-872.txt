prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: Polymerase Associated Factor 1. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In recent studies, the role of the Polymerase Associated Factor 1 (PAF1) complex in regulating gene expression has been a subject of increasing interest. The PAF1 complex, comprising PAF1, CTR9, LEO1, CDC73, and RTF1, has been implicated in various cellular processes, including transcriptional elongation, histone modifications, and mRNA processing. Disruption of the PAF1 complex has been linked to aberrant gene expression patterns and the development of various diseases, including cancer and developmental disorders. Furthermore, the interaction of the PAF1 complex with other chromatin-modifying enzymes, such as histone methyltransferases and chromatin remodeling factors, underscores its importance in epigenetic regulation. Understanding the mechanistic details of PAF1 complex function may provide insights into potential therapeutic strategies for diseases associated with dysregulated gene expression.
