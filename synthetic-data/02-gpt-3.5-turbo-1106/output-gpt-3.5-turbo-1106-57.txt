prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: cytochrome bc1. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: Cytochrome bc1 is a key enzyme complex involved in the electron transport chain in aerobic respiration. Dysregulation or malfunction of cytochrome bc1 has been linked to various pathological conditions, including mitochondrial diseases and respiratory chain deficiencies. The complex is known to interact with small molecule inhibitors such as antimycin A, an important tool in studying the function and inhibition of cytochrome bc1. Furthermore, the role of cytochrome bc1 in the pathogenesis of certain infectious diseases, such as malaria, has been studied extensively. Elucidating the structure and function of cytochrome bc1 holds promise for the development of targeted therapeutics for a range of diseases and conditions related to mitochondrial dysfunction.
