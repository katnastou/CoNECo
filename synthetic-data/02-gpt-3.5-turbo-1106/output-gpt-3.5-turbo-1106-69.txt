prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: KPC. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The KPC protein complex, known for its role in antibiotic resistance, has drawn significant attention in recent years due to its association with the spread of carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE) strains. These bacteria pose a serious public health threat, as they can cause difficult-to-treat infections with limited treatment options. Understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying KPC-mediated resistance is crucial for the development of effective strategies to combat CRE infections. In addition to its clinical implications, the KPC protein complex is also a subject of interest in environmental studies, as its presence in wastewater has been linked to the dissemination of antibiotic resistance genes. Consequently, investigating the genomic context and adaptive potential of the KPC protein complex within microbial communities is essential for assessing the risks associated with its persistence in the environment.
