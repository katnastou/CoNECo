prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: surface IgG2b. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we investigated the role of surface IgG2b in the pathogenesis of autoimmune disorders. Through a series of in vivo experiments using a murine model, we found that the expression of surface IgG2b was significantly upregulated in the presence of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Interestingly, we observed a positive correlation between the levels of surface IgG2b and the severity of nephritis in SLE-afflicted mice. Furthermore, our findings suggest that the signaling pathways involved in the activation of surface IgG2b may contribute to the dysregulation of immune responses in autoimmune conditions. These results warrant further investigation into the potential of targeting surface IgG2b as a therapeutic strategy for SLE and related autoimmune diseases.
