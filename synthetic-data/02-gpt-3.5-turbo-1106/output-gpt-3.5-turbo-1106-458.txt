model: gpt-3.5-turbo-1106
prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: IGP synthase. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we investigated the role of IGP synthase in the regulation of tryptophan biosynthesis in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Our findings revealed a crucial link between IGP synthase activity and the production of indole-3-glycerol phosphate, a key intermediate in the tryptophan biosynthetic pathway. We conducted genetic knockout experiments to demonstrate the essential nature of IGP synthase for tryptophan synthesis in yeast. Furthermore, we observed that mutations in the IGP synthase gene led to a significant reduction in tryptophan levels, which correlated with increased susceptibility to tryptophan deficiency-related cellular stress. This research sheds light on the fundamental role of IGP synthase in tryptophan metabolism and its potential implications for understanding and treating tryptophan-related disorders.
