prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: DISC. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The death-inducing signaling complex (DISC) is a critical assembly of proteins involved in the initiation of apoptotic cell death in response to extrinsic signals. In particular, DISC is known to play a central role in the activation of caspases, leading to the orchestrated dismantling of cellular components. In various studies, the importance of DISC in regulating cell fate has been highlighted, particularly in the context of diseases such as cancer, where dysregulation of apoptosis can contribute to uncontrolled cellular proliferation. Furthermore, the interaction between DISC and specific chemical agents or therapeutic compounds has emerged as a potential avenue for targeted intervention in disease states, holding promise for the development of novel treatment strategies.
