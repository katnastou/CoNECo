prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: ATG1 kinase. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we aimed to investigate the role of the ATG1 kinase in the regulation of autophagy in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Through a combination of genetic and biochemical approaches, we elucidated the interplay between ATG1 kinase activity and the cellular response to oxidative stress. Our results demonstrate that pharmacological inhibition of ATG1 kinase activity impairs the autophagic response to oxidative stress, leading to accumulation of damaged organelles and increased cellular sensitivity to reactive oxygen species. Furthermore, we found that ATG1 kinase interacts with key components of the autophagy pathway, providing mechanistic insight into its regulatory functions. These findings shed light on the pivotal role of ATG1 kinase in maintaining cellular homeostasis under conditions of oxidative stress, with implications for understanding the pathogenesis of age-related diseases.
