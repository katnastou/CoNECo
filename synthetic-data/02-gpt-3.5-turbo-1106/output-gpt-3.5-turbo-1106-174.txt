prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: 5-hydroxyisourate hydrolase. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: Research on the 5-hydroxyisourate hydrolase protein complex has revealed its important role in the catabolism of purine nucleotides. This enzyme is involved in the breakdown of uric acid, a key metabolite linked to various pathologies such as gout and hyperuricemia. Understanding the structure and function of this protein complex is crucial for the development of therapeutic interventions aimed at regulating uric acid levels in individuals with metabolic disorders. Furthermore, studying the activity and regulation of 5-hydroxyisourate hydrolase may provide insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying purine metabolism and its implications for human health. This research further highlights the potential significance of targeting this protein complex for the treatment of uric acid-related diseases.
