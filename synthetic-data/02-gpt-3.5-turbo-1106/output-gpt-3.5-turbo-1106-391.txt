prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: MINOS. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The mitochondrial inner membrane organization system (MINOS) is a conserved protein complex that functions in the maintenance of mitochondrial ultrastructure and cristae morphology. Recent studies have provided insights into the role of MINOS in mitochondrial function and its potential implications for human health. Dysfunction of MINOS has been linked to a variety of mitochondrial disorders, including neurodegenerative diseases and metabolic disorders. Understanding the regulatory mechanisms and interplay of MINOS with other mitochondrial components may offer new avenues for therapeutic interventions targeting mitochondrial dysfunction in human diseases. This research may also shed light on the broader implications of MINOS in cellular homeostasis and organismal physiology.
