prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: septin. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: Septins are a family of conserved GTP-binding proteins that play important roles in several cellular processes. Dysregulation of septin expression has been implicated in various human diseases, including cancer and neurodegenerative disorders. The formation of the septin complex is crucial for its biological function, and disruptions in septin complex assembly have been linked to pathogenic phenotypes. Recent studies have highlighted the potential of targeting the septin complex for therapeutic intervention in diseases such as Parkinson's disease and certain types of cancer. Understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying the assembly and regulation of the septin complex may provide new insights for developing novel strategies for treating these diseases.
