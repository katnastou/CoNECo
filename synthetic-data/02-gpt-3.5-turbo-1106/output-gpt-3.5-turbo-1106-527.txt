prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: eIF-4F. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The eIF-4F protein complex plays a critical role in regulating protein synthesis and translational control in eukaryotic cells. This complex consists of three subunits, including eIF-4E, eIF-4A, and eIF-4G, which function cooperatively to initiate the translation of mRNA into proteins. Dysregulation of the eIF-4F complex has been linked to various pathological conditions, such as cancer and neurological disorders. For example, aberrant activation of eIF-4F has been implicated in promoting oncogenic transformation and tumor progression. As such, targeting the eIF-4F complex represents a potential therapeutic strategy for the treatment of diseases associated with dysregulated protein synthesis. Further research into the molecular mechanisms underlying the function of eIF-4F and its potential as a therapeutic target is warranted.
