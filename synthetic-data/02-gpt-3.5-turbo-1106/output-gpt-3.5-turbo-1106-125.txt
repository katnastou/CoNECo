prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: MAT. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The MAT protein complex is a critical regulator of sulfur metabolism in yeast cells. Previous studies have demonstrated the essential role of the MAT complex in the synthesis of methionine, an important sulfur-containing amino acid. The MAT complex is composed of three subunits, and mutations in any of these subunits have been shown to disrupt the overall function of the complex, leading to methionine auxotrophy and impaired growth. Recent research has also highlighted the interplay between the MAT complex and other sulfur metabolism enzymes, such as adenosylmethionine synthetase and cystathionine beta-synthase, suggesting potential regulatory interactions that may influence cellular sulfur homeostasis. Understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying the function of the MAT complex is crucial for elucidating its role in sulfur metabolism and its potential implications in human diseases characterized by dysregulated sulfur metabolism, such as homocystinuria. Further investigation into the regulatory networks involving the MAT complex may offer valuable insights into potential therapeutic targets for these conditions.
