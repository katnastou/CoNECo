prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: VTC. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In recent years, the role of the VTC protein complex in the regulation of cellular homeostasis has garnered significant attention in the field of biomedical research. Studies have demonstrated that the VTC complex plays a crucial role in the modulation of cellular stress responses and the maintenance of redox balance. Furthermore, the dysregulation of VTC has been linked to various pathological conditions, including neurodegenerative diseases and cancer. Interestingly, the interaction between VTC and certain small molecules, such as antioxidants and signaling molecules, has been proposed as a potential target for therapeutic interventions. Understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying the function of the VTC complex may provide valuable insights for the development of novel treatments for conditions associated with cellular imbalance and dysfunction.
