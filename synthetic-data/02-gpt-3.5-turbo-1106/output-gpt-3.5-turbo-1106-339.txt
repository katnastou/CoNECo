prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: BtuCDF. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we investigated the role of the BtuCDF protein complex in the transport of vitamin B12 across the inner membrane of Escherichia coli. Our findings demonstrate that the binding of BtuCDF to the substrate, vitamin B12, is essential for the efficient uptake of this essential nutrient. We also observed that mutations in the BtuCDF complex resulted in impaired transport of vitamin B12, leading to a decrease in the cellular levels of vitamin B12 and subsequent growth defects in E. coli cells. Furthermore, our results suggest that the BtuCDF complex may serve as a potential target for the development of novel antimicrobial agents to combat bacterial infections associated with vitamin B12 deficiency. These insights into the molecular mechanism of vitamin B12 transport mediated by the BtuCDF complex provide valuable knowledge for future therapeutic strategies targeting bacterial infections.
