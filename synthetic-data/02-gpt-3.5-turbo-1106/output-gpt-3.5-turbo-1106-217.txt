prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: protein phosphatase 2. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: A growing body of evidence indicates the central role of protein phosphatase 2 (PP2) in the regulation of cellular signaling pathways. Research has demonstrated the involvement of PP2 in the dephosphorylation of various substrates, including transcription factors, cell cycle regulators, and kinases. Dysregulation of PP2 has been implicated in a wide range of human diseases, including cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, and metabolic syndromes. Furthermore, small molecule inhibitors targeting PP2 have shown promise as potential therapeutic agents for the treatment of these conditions. Given the pivotal role of PP2 in cellular homeostasis and disease pathogenesis, further investigation into the molecular mechanisms and functional implications of PP2 activity is warranted.
