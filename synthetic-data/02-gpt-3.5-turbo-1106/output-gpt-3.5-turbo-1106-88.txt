prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: TGF-beta ligand-receptor. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The TGF-beta ligand-receptor complex plays a crucial role in the regulation of various cellular processes, including cell growth, differentiation, and immune response. Dysregulation of this complex has been implicated in various pathological conditions such as cancer, fibrosis, and autoimmune diseases. The binding of TGF-beta ligand to its receptor triggers downstream signaling cascades, leading to the activation of transcription factors and modulation of gene expression. Additionally, small molecule inhibitors targeting the TGF-beta ligand-receptor complex have shown promise as potential therapeutic agents for the treatment of metastatic cancers and fibrotic diseases. Further elucidation of the intricate molecular mechanisms underlying the TGF-beta ligand-receptor complex may offer valuable insights for the development of novel therapeutic strategies.
