prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: APOBECs. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The APOBECs protein complex has garnered substantial attention due to its role in the mutagenesis of cancer cells. Recent studies have implicated APOBECs in the deamination of cytosines within the genomic DNA of cancer cells, leading to elevated mutation rates and the development of tumor heterogeneity. Furthermore, dysregulation of APOBECs has been associated with various malignancies, including breast cancer, bladder cancer, and cervical cancer. Given its potential as a therapeutic target, investigating the molecular mechanisms underlying the activity of APOBECs in cancer progression holds promise for the development of novel treatment strategies. This complex interplay between APOBECs and cancer pathogenesis underscores the significance of understanding its functional dynamics and regulatory networks in disease contexts.
