prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: NLRC4 inflammasome. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: Activation of the NLRC4 inflammasome has been implicated in the pathogenesis of various inflammatory diseases, including autoinflammatory disorders and infectious diseases. The NLRC4 inflammasome, which is composed of the NLRC4 protein and the ASC adaptor protein, plays a critical role in the immune response by mediating the maturation and secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin-1Î². Upon recognition of intracellular danger signals, such as bacterial flagellin and components of the type III secretion system, the NLRC4 inflammasome becomes activated, leading to the initiation of a caspase-1-dependent inflammatory cascade. Understanding the mechanisms underlying NLRC4 inflammasome activation and its downstream signaling pathways is crucial for the development of novel therapeutic strategies targeting inflammatory disorders.
