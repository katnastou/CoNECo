prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: CydDC. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The CydDC protein complex plays a crucial role in the transport of cysteine and cyanoamino acids across the bacterial cell membrane. Recent studies have elucidated the complex interplay between CydDC and bacterial resistance to antimicrobial agents, with implications for the treatment of infectious diseases. Additionally, the critical involvement of CydDC in maintaining the redox balance and cellular homeostasis underscores its significance in bacterial physiology. Furthermore, the identification of potential small molecule modulators targeting CydDC holds promise for the development of novel antibacterial agents with minimal risk of resistance development. These findings highlight the importance of further research into the mechanisms underlying the function of CydDC and its potential as a target for antimicrobial therapy.
