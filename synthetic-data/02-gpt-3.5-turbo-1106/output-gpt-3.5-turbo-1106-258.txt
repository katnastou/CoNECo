prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: Set3. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The Set3 protein complex plays a crucial role in the regulation of gene expression and chromatin remodeling in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Through its interaction with histone deacetylases, Set3 is involved in the deacetylation of histone proteins, thereby influencing transcriptional activity. Recent studies have revealed the significance of Set3 in the development and progression of various diseases, including cancer. The modulation of Set3 activity presents a promising avenue for therapeutic interventions targeting gene expression dysregulation in pathological conditions. Further investigation of the molecular mechanisms underlying Set3 function may uncover novel therapeutic targets for the treatment of Set3-associated diseases.
