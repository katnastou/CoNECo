prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: GATOR2. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The GATOR2 protein complex is emerging as a key regulator in the signaling pathway for mTORC1, a critical kinase complex that senses and integrates nutrient and energy signals. Recent studies have demonstrated the essential role of GATOR2 in modulating mTORC1 activity, with its dysregulation implicated in various pathological conditions, including cancer and metabolic disorders. Further investigation into the molecular mechanisms underlying GATOR2-mediated regulation of mTORC1 signaling may uncover potential therapeutic targets for diseases associated with dysregulated mTORC1 activity. This research highlights the intricate interplay between cellular signaling pathways and the potential implications for therapeutic intervention in diseases with aberrant mTORC1 signaling.
