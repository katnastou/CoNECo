prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: HEPS. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we investigate the role of the HEPS protein complex in the pathogenesis of liver fibrosis. Liver fibrosis is a common consequence of chronic liver injury, often leading to cirrhosis and liver failure. Utilizing a murine model of liver fibrosis, we observed a significant upregulation of HEPS expression in activated hepatic stellate cells, the key effector cells in fibrogenesis. Pharmacological inhibition of the TGF-Î² signaling pathway resulted in a marked reduction of HEPS levels, concurrent with attenuation of fibrotic deposition. Furthermore, manipulation of HEPS expression in vitro elucidated its role in regulating pro-fibrotic gene expression. Our findings suggest that HEPS may serve as a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of liver fibrosis.
