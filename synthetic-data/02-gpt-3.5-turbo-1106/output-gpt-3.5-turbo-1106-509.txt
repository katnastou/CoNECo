prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: nuclear cohesin. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we aimed to investigate the role of nuclear cohesin in the etiology of Cornelia de Lange syndrome (CdLS). CdLS is a rare genetic disorder characterized by multisystem involvement including facial dysmorphism, growth retardation, and intellectual disability. Previous studies have implicated mutations in the NIPBL and SMC1A genes in the pathogenesis of CdLS, which are thought to disrupt the proper functioning of nuclear cohesin. Here, we utilized a mouse model of CdLS with a specific mutation in the NIPBL gene and conducted a comprehensive analysis of the effects of disrupted nuclear cohesin on gene expression, chromatin structure, and cellular function. Our findings suggest that the dysregulation of nuclear cohesin contributes to the molecular pathology underlying CdLS, highlighting the potential therapeutic targeting of this protein complex in the treatment of CdLS and related developmental disorders.
