prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: NAD isocitric dehydrogenase. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In recent years, there has been substantial interest in understanding the role of NAD isocitric dehydrogenase in the pathophysiology of various diseases. This enzyme plays a critical role in the tricarboxylic acid cycle, where it catalyzes the conversion of isocitric acid to alpha-ketoglutaric acid while producing NADH. Dysregulation of NAD isocitric dehydrogenase has been implicated in several metabolic disorders, including diabetes and neurodegenerative diseases. Furthermore, studies have suggested that alterations in the activity and expression of this enzyme may contribute to the development of cancer and cardiovascular diseases. Given its central role in cellular metabolism, targeting NAD isocitric dehydrogenase presents an attractive opportunity for the development of novel therapeutic strategies for treating a wide range of diseases.
