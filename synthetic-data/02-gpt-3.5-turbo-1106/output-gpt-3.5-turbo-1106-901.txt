prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: interleukin-35. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: Interleukin-35 (IL-35) is a heterodimeric cytokine belonging to the interleukin-12 (IL-12) family, which plays a crucial role in modulating immune responses. IL-35 is known for its immunosuppressive effects and has been implicated in various inflammatory and autoimmune diseases, including multiple sclerosis and rheumatoid arthritis. Recent studies have highlighted the potential of IL-35 as a therapeutic target for immune-mediated disorders. The mechanisms underlying IL-35 signaling and its interactions with regulatory T cells and B cells have been the focus of intense investigation, offering new insights into the intricate regulation of immune homeostasis. Further elucidation of the role of IL-35 in immune modulation may lead to the development of novel therapeutic strategies for treating immunological disorders.
