prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: collagen trimer. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The collagen trimer is a vital component of the extracellular matrix, essential for providing structural support to tissues and organs. Dysfunction of this protein complex has been implicated in various pathological conditions, such as osteogenesis imperfecta and Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, characterized by impaired bone formation and connective tissue abnormalities, respectively. Recent studies have highlighted the potential role of collagen trimer in mediating interactions with integrins, leading to downstream signaling events that contribute to cell adhesion, migration, and proliferation. Moreover, the regulation of collagen trimer synthesis and assembly has garnered significant interest, as it may offer therapeutic targets for conditions associated with collagenopathies. Further investigation into the molecular mechanisms governing the function and dysregulation of collagen trimer will undoubtedly yield valuable insights for the development of targeted interventions for these debilitating disorders.
