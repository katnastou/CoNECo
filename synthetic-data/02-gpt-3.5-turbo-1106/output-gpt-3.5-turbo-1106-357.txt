prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: NPC. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The Nuclear Pore Complex (NPC) is a vital structure that regulates the trafficking of macromolecules between the nucleus and cytoplasm in eukaryotic cells. Dysfunction of the NPC has been linked to various diseases, including cancer and neurodegenerative disorders, emphasizing the importance of understanding its molecular mechanisms. Recent studies have implicated the role of small molecule inhibitors in modulating NPC function, offering potential therapeutic avenues for diseases associated with NPC dysregulation. Further investigation into the interplay between NPC and disease pathology may lead to the development of targeted interventions aimed at restoring normal cellular homeostasis.
