prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: RecBCD. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The RecBCD protein complex, consisting of RecB, RecC, and RecD subunits, plays a crucial role in the homologous recombination pathway, a fundamental process for maintaining genome stability in bacteria. This complex is involved in DNA repair, particularly in processing double-strand breaks to generate single-stranded DNA that serves as a substrate for recombination. Notably, RecBCD has been implicated in the repair of DNA damage caused by ionizing radiation and certain chemotherapeutic agents. Dysregulation of RecBCD activity has been associated with increased genomic instability and susceptibility to mutagenic insults, highlighting its importance in safeguarding the integrity of the bacterial genome. Understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying RecBCD function may have implications for the development of novel strategies for combating antibiotic resistance and enhancing the efficacy of DNA-damaging therapies in the clinical setting.
