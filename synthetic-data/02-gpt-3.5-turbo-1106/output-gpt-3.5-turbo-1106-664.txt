prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: DNMT3A–3L. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The DNMT3A–3L protein complex has been implicated in the epigenetic regulation of gene expression in various disease pathologies. Previous research has shown that the overexpression or dysregulation of DNMT3A–3L is associated with aberrant DNA methylation patterns in cancer cell lines and patient samples. Furthermore, studies have revealed an interaction between DNMT3A–3L and specific small molecule inhibitors of DNA methyltransferases, suggesting a potential role for these inhibitors in modulating the activity of DNMT3A–3L. In addition, genetic studies in model organisms have demonstrated the importance of DNMT3A–3L in embryonic development and maintenance of tissue homeostasis. Given its significant impact on disease processes, further investigation into the mechanisms of DNMT3A–3L function and its potential as a therapeutic target is warranted.
