prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: kinesin I. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: A key regulator of intracellular transport in neuronal cells, kinesin I plays a critical role in the anterograde movement of organelles and vesicles along microtubules. The ATPase activity of kinesin I provides the energy required for the processive movement of these cargoes, contributing to important cellular functions such as axonal transport and synaptic transmission. Dysregulation of kinesin I has been linked to neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's. Moreover, kinesin I has emerged as a potential therapeutic target for the development of novel treatments aimed at restoring proper intracellular transport in the context of neurodegenerative disorders. Understanding the regulatory mechanisms and functional implications of kinesin I in neuronal cells is crucial for elucidating the pathophysiology of these diseases and for identifying potential targets for intervention.
