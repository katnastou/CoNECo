prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: MIND. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we investigated the role of the MIND protein complex in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease. We utilized a transgenic mouse model expressing mutated amyloid precursor protein to analyze the impact of MIND on cognitive function and synaptic plasticity. Our data revealed that genetic ablation of MIND exacerbates AÎ² plaque deposition and impairs long-term potentiation in the hippocampus. Furthermore, we observed an upregulation of inflammatory cytokines and a marked increase in tau hyperphosphorylation in MIND-deficient mice. These findings suggest that MIND plays a critical role in modulating neuroinflammatory responses and maintaining synaptic integrity in Alzheimer's disease. Targeting MIND may therefore offer a promising therapeutic strategy for mitigating the progression of this devastating neurodegenerative disorder.
