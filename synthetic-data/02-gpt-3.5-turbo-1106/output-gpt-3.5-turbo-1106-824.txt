prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: ThiBPQ. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we aimed to elucidate the functional role of ThiBPQ in Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection. We investigated the interaction between ThiBPQ and the virulence factors of M. tuberculosis, as well as its impact on the host immune response. Our results revealed that ThiBPQ is essential for the intracellular survival of M. tuberculosis and is involved in modulating the expression of key immune-related genes in infected macrophages. Furthermore, we identified a novel small molecule inhibitor that specifically targets ThiBPQ, resulting in a significant reduction in bacterial load in an in vitro infection model. These findings highlight the potential of targeting ThiBPQ as a novel therapeutic strategy for combating M. tuberculosis infection.
