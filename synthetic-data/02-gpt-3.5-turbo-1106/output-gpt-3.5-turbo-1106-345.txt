prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: DNMT3B–3L. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The role of the DNMT3B–3L protein complex in the epigenetic regulation of gene expression has garnered significant attention in recent years. Dysregulation of this complex has been implicated in a range of pathological conditions, including cancer and neurodevelopmental disorders. Through its interactions with DNA methyltransferases and other epigenetic modifiers, the DNMT3B–3L complex plays a critical role in maintaining DNA methylation patterns and ultimately influencing cellular behavior. Mounting evidence suggests that aberrant expression or function of this complex may contribute to the pathogenesis of various diseases, making it a promising target for therapeutic interventions. Further elucidation of the mechanisms underlying the functions of the DNMT3B–3L complex may yield valuable insights into disease pathophysiology and potential therapeutic strategies.
