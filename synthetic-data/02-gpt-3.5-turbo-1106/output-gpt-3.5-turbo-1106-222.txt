prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: SF3B. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: Recent studies have highlighted the critical role of the SF3B protein complex in the pathogenesis of myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), a group of hematopoietic disorders characterized by ineffective hematopoiesis and an increased risk of progression to acute myeloid leukemia. SF3B is known to mediate the recognition of 3' splice sites during pre-mRNA splicing, and dysregulation of its function has been implicated in the aberrant splicing of key genes involved in hematopoiesis. Abnormal splicing events due to SF3B dysfunction have been associated with the development and progression of MDS, providing a potential avenue for targeted therapeutic intervention. Furthermore, the identification of small molecule modulators capable of targeting SF3B and restoring normal splicing patterns holds promise for the development of novel treatments for MDS, offering potential benefits for patients afflicted with this debilitating disease.
