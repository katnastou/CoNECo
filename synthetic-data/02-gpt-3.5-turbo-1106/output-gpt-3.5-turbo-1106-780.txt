prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: RNA polymerase III. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: RNA polymerase III is a key enzyme responsible for the transcription of small nuclear RNAs, including tRNA and 5S rRNA. Dysregulation of RNA polymerase III activity has been implicated in a wide range of human diseases, including cancer and neurodegenerative disorders. Recent studies have identified potential therapeutic targets for modulating the function of RNA polymerase III in the context of these diseases. Additionally, several small molecule inhibitors have been developed to target the activity of this complex, showing promise as potential candidates for drug development. Further investigation into the specific mechanisms of RNA polymerase III dysregulation in disease pathogenesis may provide valuable insights for the development of novel therapeutic strategies.
