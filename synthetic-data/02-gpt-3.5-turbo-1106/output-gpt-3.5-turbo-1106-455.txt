prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: Gin4. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: Recent studies have demonstrated the critical role of the Gin4 protein complex in the regulation of cell division and morphogenesis in yeast. The Gin4 complex has been shown to interact with key signaling pathways involved in the coordination of polarized growth and cytokinesis. Furthermore, it has been implicated in the modulation of cell wall integrity and the response to environmental stress. The disruption of the Gin4 complex has been associated with aberrant cell morphology and impaired cytokinesis, leading to growth defects. Given its pivotal role in cellular processes, the Gin4 complex presents as a potential target for the development of novel antifungal agents for the treatment of yeast infections. This research sheds light on the essential functions of the Gin4 complex and its implications for understanding cellular morphology and division in yeast.
