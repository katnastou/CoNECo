prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: MSL. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The MSL protein complex has been identified as a key regulator of chromatin structure and gene expression in Drosophila melanogaster. Recent studies have shown that the MSL complex plays a crucial role in the dosage compensation mechanism, which equalizes the expression of X-linked genes between males and females. In addition, the MSL complex has been implicated in the regulation of neuronal development and behavior. Dysfunction of the MSL complex has been associated with developmental disorders and neurological diseases, highlighting its significance in maintaining normal physiological processes. Further investigation into the molecular mechanisms underlying the function of the MSL complex may provide valuable insights into potential therapeutic targets for these conditions.
