prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: CenH3 containing nucleosome. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we explored the role of the CenH3 containing nucleosome in the development of mitotic spindle assembly and chromosome segregation in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Through genetic manipulation and live cell imaging, we elucidated the dynamic interactions between the CenH3 containing nucleosome and the kinetochore complex during mitosis. Our results indicate that the proper localization and function of the CenH3 containing nucleosome are crucial for accurate chromosome segregation and prevention of aneuploidy. Furthermore, we observed a correlation between aberrant CenH3 containing nucleosome assembly and increased susceptibility to chromosomal instability-related diseases, highlighting the potential clinical relevance of our findings. This research sheds light on the molecular mechanisms underlying faithful chromosome segregation and lays the groundwork for further investigation into the therapeutic targeting of the CenH3 containing nucleosome in diseases associated with chromosomal instability.
