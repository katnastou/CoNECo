prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: IPI. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The role of the IPI protein complex in regulating cellular metabolism has significant implications for understanding the molecular underpinnings of metabolic diseases. Through its interaction with various regulatory factors, the IPI complex modulates the expression of key metabolic pathways, including glycolysis and fatty acid metabolism. Dysregulation of the IPI complex has been implicated in metabolic disorders such as type 2 diabetes and obesity. Furthermore, studies have revealed that pharmacological interventions targeting the activity of the IPI complex hold promise for the development of novel therapeutic strategies to manage metabolic diseases. Understanding the intricate regulatory mechanisms governing the IPI complex may offer new avenues for the treatment of metabolic disorders.
