prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: BMP receptors. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we investigated the effects of a novel small molecule inhibitor on the activity of BMP receptors in a mouse model of osteoarthritis. The inhibitor, named ExBMP-42, was found to significantly suppress the activation of BMP receptors in chondrocytes, leading to a reduction in cartilage degradation and inflammation in the affected joints. Furthermore, treatment with ExBMP-42 resulted in a noticeable improvement in locomotor function and a reduction in pain behavior in the osteoarthritic mice. Our findings suggest that targeting BMP receptors with ExBMP-42 may offer a promising therapeutic approach for mitigating the progression of osteoarthritis and alleviating associated symptoms in affected individuals.
