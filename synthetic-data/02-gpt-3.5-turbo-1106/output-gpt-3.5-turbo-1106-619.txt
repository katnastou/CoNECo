prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: replication protein A. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we investigated the role of the replication protein A (RPA) complex in the context of DNA damage response. Through a series of experiments utilizing human cell lines, we demonstrated that upon exposure to genotoxic agents, such as UV radiation and chemotherapeutic drugs, the RPA complex is rapidly recruited to sites of DNA damage, where it plays a critical role in mediating DNA repair processes. Furthermore, we observed that depletion of RPA complex components led to increased sensitivity to DNA damaging agents, indicating the essential nature of this complex in maintaining genomic integrity. Overall, our findings highlight the significance of the RPA complex in cellular responses to DNA damage and provide a deeper understanding of its potential implications for human diseases, particularly cancer susceptibility and treatment outcomes.
