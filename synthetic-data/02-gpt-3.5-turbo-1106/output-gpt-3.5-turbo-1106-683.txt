prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: Nar. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we sought to elucidate the role of the Nar protein complex in the pathogenesis of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). We evaluated the expression of Nar in lung tissues from PAH patients and healthy controls, as well as in a rodent model of PAH. Our results revealed a significant upregulation of Nar in the pulmonary arteries of PAH patients and in the lungs of PAH-induced rodents, suggesting a potential involvement of Nar in the development and progression of PAH. Furthermore, we investigated the effect of Nar inhibition using a specific small molecule inhibitor in our animal model, demonstrating a significant reduction in pulmonary vascular remodeling and right ventricular hypertrophy. These findings highlight the potential of targeting the Nar protein complex as a therapeutic strategy for PAH, opening up new avenues for the treatment of this devastating disease.
