prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: TGF-betal. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The TGF-betal protein complex has been implicated in the pathogenesis of various diseases, including cancer and fibrosis. Previous studies have demonstrated the important role of TGF-betal in modulating the activity of immune cells and promoting the development of a pro-tumorigenic microenvironment. In addition, dysregulation of TGF-betal signaling has been linked to the progression of fibrotic diseases in various organs, such as the lung, liver, and kidney. Targeting the TGF-betal pathway has therefore emerged as a promising therapeutic strategy for the treatment of these conditions. As such, the development of small molecule inhibitors and biologic agents that selectively target TGF-betal signaling represents an active area of research for the treatment of cancer and fibrotic diseases.
