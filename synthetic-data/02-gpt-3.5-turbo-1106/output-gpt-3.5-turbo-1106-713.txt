prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: transcription export complex 2. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: Transcription export complex 2 (TREX-2) is a critical multi-subunit complex involved in the transport of messenger RNA (mRNA) from the nucleus to the cytoplasm in eukaryotic cells. Dysregulation of TREX-2 has been associated with various disorders, including neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative diseases. Previous studies have demonstrated the interaction between TREX-2 and factors such as the THO complex and the RNA helicase UAP56 in facilitating mRNA export. Furthermore, the role of TREX-2 in maintaining the integrity of mRNA transcripts before their export highlights its significance in cellular homeostasis. Future investigation into the precise mechanisms and regulatory pathways involving TREX-2 may provide valuable insights into the pathogenesis of diseases associated with mRNA processing and export.
