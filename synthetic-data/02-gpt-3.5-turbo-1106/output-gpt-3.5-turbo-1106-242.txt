prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: apical TBC. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: Recent studies have highlighted the critical role of the apical TBC protein complex in the regulation of epithelial cell polarity and differentiation. The apical TBC complex interacts with key signaling pathways such as the Wnt and Notch pathways, contributing to the maintenance of tissue homeostasis and the prevention of aberrant cell proliferation. Malfunction of the apical TBC complex has been implicated in the pathogenesis of several human diseases, including polycystic kidney disease and cholangiocarcinoma. Furthermore, the apical TBC complex is a potential target for therapeutic interventions aimed at modulating epithelial cell behavior and treating associated diseases. Further investigation into the precise molecular mechanisms underlying the function of the apical TBC complex is warranted to fully elucidate its role in human health and disease.
