prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: GPI-GnT. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In recent studies, the role of the GPI-GnT protein complex in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease has been investigated. The findings suggest that aberrant glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) synthesis, facilitated by the GPI-GnT complex, may contribute to the onset and progression of Alzheimer's disease. Specifically, dysregulation of the GPI-GnT complex was observed in post-mortem brain tissue of Alzheimer's patients, indicating its potential involvement in the disease pathology. Moreover, pharmacological inhibition of the GPI-GnT complex resulted in amelioration of cognitive impairment in mouse models of Alzheimer's disease, highlighting the therapeutic potential of targeting this complex. These findings shed light on the molecular mechanisms underlying Alzheimer's disease and provide insight into novel therapeutic strategies targeting the GPI-GnT complex.
