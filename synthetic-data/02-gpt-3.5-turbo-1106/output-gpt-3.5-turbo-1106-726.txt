prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: EBI3. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The cytokine receptor subunit EBI3 is a key player in modulating the immune response and has garnered significant attention in the field of immunology. Studies have shown that EBI3 is involved in the regulation of T cell responses and can influence the development and progression of various autoimmune diseases, such as multiple sclerosis and rheumatoid arthritis. Furthermore, the expression of EBI3 has been implicated in the pathogenesis of certain cancers, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target for cancer immunotherapy. The interactions between EBI3 and its associated partners have also been widely investigated, shedding light on the complex signaling pathways involved in immune regulation. Overall, the multifaceted role of EBI3 in immune function and disease pathogenesis makes it a promising candidate for further research and therapeutic targeting.
