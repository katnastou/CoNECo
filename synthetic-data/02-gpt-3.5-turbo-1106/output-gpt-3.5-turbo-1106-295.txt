prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: SufA. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The SufA protein complex has been identified as a crucial player in the iron-sulfur cluster biosynthesis pathway in various organisms. Previous studies have shown that SufA is responsible for the maturation of iron-sulfur cluster-containing proteins, which are essential for several cellular processes. Dysfunction of the SufA complex has been linked to impaired respiratory chain function, leading to pathological outcomes such as mitochondrial disorders and neurodegenerative diseases. Furthermore, emerging evidence suggests that small molecule modulators targeting the SufA complex could serve as potential therapeutic agents for iron-sulfur cluster-related disorders. Further investigation into the mechanisms and regulation of the SufA complex could provide valuable insights for the development of novel therapeutic strategies for these debilitating conditions.
