prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: arginine-specific carbamoyl phosphate synthetase. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: Arginine-specific carbamoyl phosphate synthetase is a crucial enzyme in the biosynthesis of arginine, an essential amino acid in humans. This enzyme is responsible for catalyzing the formation of carbamoyl phosphate from ammonia and bicarbonate, which is then used in the subsequent steps of the arginine biosynthetic pathway. Dysregulation of arginine-specific carbamoyl phosphate synthetase activity has been implicated in various pathological conditions, including urea cycle disorders and certain types of cancer. Understanding the precise regulatory mechanisms and functional roles of this enzyme may offer insights into potential therapeutic targets for these diseases. Furthermore, elucidating the structural and biochemical properties of arginine-specific carbamoyl phosphate synthetase could provide valuable information for the development of novel pharmacological interventions aimed at modulating its activity.
