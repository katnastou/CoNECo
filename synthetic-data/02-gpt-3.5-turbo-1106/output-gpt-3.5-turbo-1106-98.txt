prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: SC5b-7. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: Activation of the complement system is a crucial immune defense mechanism against pathogens and damaged cells. One important step in the complement cascade is the formation of the SC5b-7 complex, which plays a central role in the terminal pathway of complement activation. The binding of complement component C5 to C3b results in the generation of SC5b-7, leading to the formation of the membrane attack complex (MAC) and subsequent lysis of target cells. Dysregulation of SC5b-7 assembly has been implicated in various autoimmune diseases and inflammatory conditions, highlighting the significance of understanding its regulatory mechanisms. In this study, we investigated the role of SC5b-7 in the pathogenesis of systemic lupus erythematosus, shedding light on potential therapeutic targets for modulating complement activation in autoimmune disorders.
