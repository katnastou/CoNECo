prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: EKC. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In recent years, the EKC protein complex has garnered increasing attention in the field of neurodegenerative diseases. Studies have implicated the abnormal aggregation of EKC in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. The aberrant interaction between EKC and tau protein has been of particular interest, with implications for the development of potential therapeutic interventions targeting this interaction. Additionally, the role of EKC in modulating inflammatory responses and its potential involvement in immune-related pathways have raised intriguing questions about the complex's broader relevance in the context of neuroinflammation. Future investigations exploring the regulatory mechanisms of EKC and its interactions with various cellular components are warranted to further elucidate its contribution to neurodegenerative disorders.
