prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: PFDL modules. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In recent studies, the role of the PFDL modules in cellular pathways has attracted considerable attention. The PFDL modules have been shown to interact with key regulatory proteins involved in chronic inflammatory diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis, through their binding to specific small molecule inhibitors. Furthermore, the PFDL modules have been shown to modulate signal transduction pathways associated with cancer progression. These findings highlight the potential of targeting the PFDL modules as a therapeutic strategy for treating inflammatory and neoplastic diseases. Further investigation into the precise mechanisms and downstream effects of PFDL module interactions may provide valuable insights for the development of novel treatment approaches.
