prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: interleukin-15 receptor. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we investigated the role of the interleukin-15 receptor (IL-15R) in the pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Our findings indicate that increased expression of IL-15R was observed in the synovial tissues of RA patients compared to healthy controls. Furthermore, we demonstrated that blockade of the IL-15R signaling pathway resulted in a reduction of pro-inflammatory cytokine production and ameliorated disease severity in a murine model of RA. These results suggest that targeting the IL-15R may represent a promising therapeutic strategy for the treatment of RA. Overall, our study provides valuable insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying the dysregulation of IL-15R in RA and supports its potential as a therapeutic target for this debilitating autoimmune disease.
