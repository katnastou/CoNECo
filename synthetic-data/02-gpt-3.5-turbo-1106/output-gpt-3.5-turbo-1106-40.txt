prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: protein phosphatase 4. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The protein phosphatase 4 (PP4) complex is a critical regulator of various cellular processes, including cell cycle progression, DNA damage response, and gene expression. Recent studies have shown that PP4 is involved in the dephosphorylation of key substrates, such as p53 and ATM, thereby influencing the cellular response to genotoxic stress. Dysregulation of PP4 has been implicated in several human diseases, including cancer and neurodegenerative disorders. Moreover, small molecule inhibitors targeting PP4 activity have demonstrated potential as therapeutic agents in the treatment of these diseases. Understanding the intricate biochemical and functional properties of the PP4 complex holds promise for the development of novel therapeutic interventions for a range of human pathologies.
