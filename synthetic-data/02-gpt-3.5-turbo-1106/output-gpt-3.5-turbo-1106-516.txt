prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: laminin-6. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we investigated the potential role of laminin-6 in the pathogenesis of diabetic nephropathy. Our results demonstrated that laminin-6 expression was significantly increased in the glomerular basement membrane of diabetic mice compared to control mice. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed co-localization of laminin-6 with fibronectin and collagen IV, suggesting a potential interaction between these extracellular matrix proteins in diabetic kidney disease. Furthermore, in vitro studies using cultured human mesangial cells showed that high glucose conditions led to upregulation of laminin-6 expression, indicating a possible link between hyperglycemia and laminin-6 production. These findings indicate that laminin-6 may play a crucial role in the development and progression of diabetic nephropathy, and further research on targeting laminin-6 as a therapeutic strategy for this condition is warranted.
