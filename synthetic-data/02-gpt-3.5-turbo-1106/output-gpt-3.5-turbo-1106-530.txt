prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: L-Ficolin. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we investigated the role of the L-Ficolin protein complex in the pathogenesis of influenza infection. Using an experimental mouse model, we observed a significant reduction in viral replication and an attenuated inflammatory response in L-Ficolin deficient mice compared to wild-type controls. Additionally, we found that L-Ficolin deficiency was associated with a decrease in pulmonary damage and an improvement in the overall survival rate of infected animals. Furthermore, our results suggest that L-Ficolin may modulate the host immune response to influenza virus, providing valuable insights for the development of novel therapeutic strategies targeting this protein complex in the context of viral infections.
