prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: TOR complex 2. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The TOR complex 2 is a critical regulator of cellular growth and proliferation, playing a key role in a wide range of cellular processes. Dysregulation of the TOR complex 2 has been linked to various diseases, including cancer, diabetes, and neurodegenerative disorders. Recent studies have highlighted the significance of TOR complex 2 in the modulation of cellular metabolism and the response to environmental cues. Additionally, emerging evidence suggests that TOR complex 2 inhibitors may hold therapeutic potential in the treatment of certain pathological conditions. Further investigation into the molecular mechanisms and signaling pathways associated with TOR complex 2 is warranted to fully understand its physiological and pathological implications.
