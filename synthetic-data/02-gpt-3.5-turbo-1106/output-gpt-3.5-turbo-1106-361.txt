prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: RTC. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The role of the RTC protein complex in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease has been a subject of great interest in recent years. Previous studies have implicated the involvement of the RTC complex in the regulation of mitochondrial function and cellular homeostasis. Furthermore, the dysregulation of RTC has been linked to the accumulation of oxidative stress and neuronal degeneration observed in Parkinson's disease. In this study, we aimed to investigate the potential therapeutic effects of a novel small molecule inhibitor targeting the activity of the RTC complex in a pre-clinical model of Parkinson's disease. Our findings revealed that treatment with the RTC inhibitor resulted in significant improvements in motor function and attenuation of dopaminergic neuronal loss. These results highlight the promising potential of targeting the RTC complex as a novel therapeutic strategy for the treatment of Parkinson's disease.
