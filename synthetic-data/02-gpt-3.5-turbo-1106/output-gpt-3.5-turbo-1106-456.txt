prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: PRC2. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2) has emerged as a critical regulator of gene expression in various biological processes. Recent studies have implicated PRC2 in the epigenetic control of cellular proliferation and differentiation, with dysregulation of PRC2 activity being associated with the progression of various diseases, including cancer. The catalytic subunit of PRC2, EZH2, plays a central role in mediating histone methylation, leading to chromatin remodeling and transcriptional repression. Interestingly, small molecule inhibitors targeting PRC2 have shown promise in preclinical models of cancer, suggesting that modulation of PRC2 activity could be a potential therapeutic strategy for certain malignancies. Further investigation into the complex interplay of PRC2 in cellular processes and disease pathogenesis is essential for understanding its potential as a target for novel therapeutic interventions.
