model: gpt-3.5-turbo-1106
prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: GammaTuRC. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The GammaTuRC protein complex plays a crucial role in the formation and regulation of microtubules, which are essential for various cellular processes including cell division, intracellular transport, and cell shape maintenance. Recent studies have shown that dysregulation of GammaTuRC expression is associated with various pathological conditions, including neurodegenerative disorders and cancer. In addition, the development of small molecule inhibitors targeting GammaTuRC has shown promise in preclinical models for the treatment of certain malignancies. Further investigation into the precise mechanisms of action and potential therapeutic interventions related to GammaTuRC is warranted to advance our understanding of its role in disease pathogenesis and potential clinical applications.
