prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: NoRC. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The nucleolar remodeling complex (NoRC) is a critical epigenetic regulator involved in the transcriptional silencing of ribosomal DNA (rDNA) arrays. NoRC functions as a multi-subunit ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling complex, with key roles in heterochromatin formation and maintenance. Dysregulation of NoRC activity has been implicated in various human diseases, including cancer and genetic disorders. Recent studies have elucidated the interaction of NoRC with specific non-coding RNA molecules, shedding light on its intricate regulatory mechanisms. Understanding the molecular intricacies of the NoRC complex holds promise for the development of novel therapeutic interventions aiming to modulate its epigenetic activities in disease states.
