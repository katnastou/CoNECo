prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: RFA. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we investigated the potential role of the ribosome-inactivating factor RFA in the progression of colorectal cancer. Through in vitro experiments, we observed a significant increase in the expression levels of RFA in cancerous tissue compared to normal tissue from the same patients. Further analysis revealed a positive correlation between RFA expression and tumor size, as well as tumor stage. Additionally, inhibition of RFA activity using a specific inhibitor resulted in a significant decrease in cell viability and proliferation in colorectal cancer cell lines. These findings suggest that RFA may play a pivotal role in the development and progression of colorectal cancer, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target for this malignancy.
