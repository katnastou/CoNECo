prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: TRAMP4. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: A growing body of evidence has implicated TRAMP4, a member of the TRAMP complex, in the regulation of cellular processes. Recent studies have revealed a potential role of TRAMP4 in DNA repair mechanisms, specifically in the context of genome stability. Moreover, emerging data suggest that TRAMP4 may interact with various signaling pathways involved in cell cycle progression and apoptosis. Given its diverse physiological functions, it is not surprising that dysregulation of TRAMP4 has been associated with several human diseases, including cancer and neurodegenerative disorders. Further investigation into the molecular mechanisms governing the activity of TRAMP4 promises to shed light on its therapeutic potential for the treatment of these diseases.
