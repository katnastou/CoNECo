prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: PAN. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The protein complex PAN has garnered growing interest in the field of cancer research due to its potential role in regulating cell proliferation and survival. Recent studies have demonstrated that PAN is overexpressed in various cancer types, including colon cancer and pancreatic cancer. Furthermore, inhibition of PAN activity has been shown to impair tumor growth and sensitize cancer cells to chemotherapeutic agents. This highlights PAN as a promising target for the development of novel cancer therapies. Mechanistic investigations have identified the interaction between PAN and specific signaling pathways involved in cell cycle progression and apoptosis. Moreover, analysis of patient samples has revealed a correlation between high PAN expression levels and poor clinical outcomes, further emphasizing the clinical significance of PAN in cancer progression. Therefore, further exploration of PAN as a potential therapeutic target holds promise for advancing cancer treatment strategies.
