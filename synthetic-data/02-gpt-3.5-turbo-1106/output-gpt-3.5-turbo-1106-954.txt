prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: caseinolytic protease X. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we aimed to investigate the regulatory role of the caseinolytic protease X in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases. Using an experimental animal model, we examined the effects of small molecule inhibitors targeting caseinolytic protease X on protein aggregation, neuroinflammation, and cognitive impairment. Our results revealed a significant reduction in protein aggregation and attenuation of neuroinflammatory markers in treated animals, as compared to controls. Additionally, we observed a marked improvement in cognitive function in the treated group. These findings highlight the potential of targeting caseinolytic protease X as a therapeutic strategy for mitigating the progression of neurodegenerative diseases. Further investigations into the precise mechanisms underlying the neuroprotective effects of caseinolytic protease X inhibition are warranted.
