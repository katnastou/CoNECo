prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: BCR3. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we investigated the role of the BCR3 protein complex in the pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis. Our results demonstrate a significant upregulation of BCR3 expression in synovial tissue samples obtained from patients with active rheumatoid arthritis compared to healthy controls. Furthermore, we observed a positive correlation between BCR3 levels and disease severity, as evidenced by increased joint inflammation and cartilage degradation in rheumatoid arthritis patients with higher BCR3 expression. Additionally, our findings suggest a potential link between BCR3 and the pro-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-6 (IL-6), as BCR3 inhibition led to decreased IL-6 production in in vitro experiments. These findings shed light on the involvement of the BCR3 protein complex in the molecular pathways underlying rheumatoid arthritis and highlight its potential as a therapeutic target for this debilitating autoimmune disease.
