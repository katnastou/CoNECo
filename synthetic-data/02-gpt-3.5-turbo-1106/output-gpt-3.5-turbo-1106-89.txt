prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: mitochondrial cytochrome bc1. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The mitochondrial cytochrome bc1 is a critical component of the electron transport chain, playing a central role in oxidative phosphorylation within eukaryotic cells. Dysfunction of the mitochondrial cytochrome bc1 complex has been implicated in various pathological conditions, including neurodegenerative disorders, cardiovascular diseases, and metabolic disorders. Recent studies have shed light on the dynamic interaction between the mitochondrial cytochrome bc1 complex and its associated cofactors, such as ubiquinone and cytochrome c, highlighting the intricate regulatory mechanisms underlying mitochondrial bioenergetics. Furthermore, the identification of small molecule modulators targeting the mitochondrial cytochrome bc1 complex has spurred interest in exploring potential therapeutic interventions for diseases associated with mitochondrial dysfunction. These findings underscore the importance of further elucidating the molecular mechanisms governing the function and regulation of the mitochondrial cytochrome bc1 complex in health and disease.
