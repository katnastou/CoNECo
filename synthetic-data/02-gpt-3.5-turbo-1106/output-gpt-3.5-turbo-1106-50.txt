prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: Ferrichrome outer membrane transporter. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we investigated the role of the Ferrichrome outer membrane transporter in the pathogenesis of iron-related disorders. Using a mouse model, we observed that the knockout of the Ferrichrome outer membrane transporter gene led to an accumulation of ferrichrome in the liver, ultimately leading to hepatic dysfunction. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the absence of the Ferrichrome outer membrane transporter resulted in increased susceptibility to bacterial infections, highlighting its crucial role in innate immunity. These findings provide valuable insights into the importance of the Ferrichrome outer membrane transporter in iron homeostasis and host defense mechanisms, underscoring its potential as a target for therapeutic intervention in iron-related diseases.
