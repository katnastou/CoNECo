prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: IgG3. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we investigated the role of the IgG3 protein complex in the pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis. Utilizing murine models of the disease, we observed a significant increase in IgG3 levels in the synovial fluid of affected joints compared to control groups. Furthermore, we observed a positive correlation between IgG3 levels and disease severity, as evidenced by histological examination and clinical scores. Subsequent analysis revealed that IgG3 deposition in the joint tissues was associated with the activation of complement factors and the infiltration of inflammatory cells, suggesting a potential role for IgG3 in driving joint inflammation and damage. These findings highlight the potential of targeting the IgG3 complex as a therapeutic strategy for rheumatoid arthritis.
