prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: Hydrogenase-1. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In the present study, we investigated the potential role of the hydrogenase-1 protein complex in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease. Utilizing a mouse model of the disease, we demonstrated a significant upregulation of hydrogenase-1 expression in the substantia nigra, a brain region affected by Parkinson's disease pathology. Subsequent analysis revealed a positive correlation between hydrogenase-1 levels and the observed dopaminergic neuronal degeneration. Furthermore, treatment with an inhibitor of hydrogenase-1 activity resulted in attenuated neurodegeneration and improved motor function in the mice. Our findings suggest that hydrogenase-1 may play a pivotal role in the progression of Parkinson's disease and could serve as a potential therapeutic target for intervention.
