prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: SWItch/Sucrose Non-Fermentable. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The SWItch/Sucrose Non-Fermentable (SWI/SNF) protein complex has been implicated in the regulation of gene expression and has been the focus of considerable interest in cancer research. Studies have demonstrated the involvement of SWI/SNF in chromatin remodeling and its role in influencing cellular processes such as differentiation and proliferation. Mutations in components of the SWI/SNF complex have been associated with various human malignancies, including rhabdoid tumors and certain subtypes of leukemia. Moreover, recent evidence suggests a potential link between SWI/SNF dysfunction and the development of drug resistance in cancer. Given its significant impact on oncogenesis and therapeutic response, targeting the SWI/SNF complex presents a promising avenue for the development of novel anti-cancer strategies.
