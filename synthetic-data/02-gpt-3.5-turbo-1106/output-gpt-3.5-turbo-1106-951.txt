prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: GMPR2. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: GMPR2 is a key enzyme involved in the regulation of guanosine monophosphate (GMP) metabolism, playing a crucial role in maintaining cellular homeostasis. Dysregulation of GMPR2 has been implicated in several human diseases, including cancer and neurodevelopmental disorders. Recent studies have uncovered the interaction of GMPR2 with a novel small molecule inhibitor, providing a potential avenue for the development of targeted therapeutics. Additionally, investigations into the genetic variation of GMPR2 in various populations have shed light on its evolutionary conservation and potential impact on susceptibility to GMP-related disorders. Further research into the functional significance of GMPR2 and its potential as a therapeutic target is warranted to advance our understanding of its role in disease pathogenesis.
