prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: Nup107-120. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In recent years, the nuclear pore complex (NPC) has garnered considerable attention for its role in regulating the transport of macromolecules between the nucleus and cytoplasm. The Nup107-120 complex, a key component of the NPC, has been implicated in various cellular processes, including mRNA export and nuclear envelope formation. Dysregulation of Nup107-120 has been associated with several human diseases, such as cancer and viral infections. Additionally, small molecules targeting the Nup107-120 complex have shown promising results in preclinical studies, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target for diseases involving nucleocytoplasmic transport dysfunction. Further investigation of the molecular mechanisms underlying the function of the Nup107-120 complex is warranted to fully understand its physiological and pathological implications.
