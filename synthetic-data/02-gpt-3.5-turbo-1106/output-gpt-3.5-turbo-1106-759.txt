model: gpt-3.5-turbo-1106
prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: UTP-B. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In recent years, the UTP-B protein complex has garnered significant attention as a potential regulator of ribosomal biogenesis. Studies have demonstrated that UTP-B plays a crucial role in the assembly of the small ribosomal subunit in eukaryotic cells. Furthermore, the dysregulation of UTP-B activity has been linked to the development of several human diseases, including ribosomopathies such as Diamond-Blackfan anemia. Recent advances in understanding the molecular mechanisms governing the function of UTP-B have opened new avenues for therapeutic interventions targeting ribosomal disorders. Further investigation into the precise role of UTP-B in ribosome biogenesis and its potential as a therapeutic target is warranted to advance our understanding of its biological significance and clinical implications.
