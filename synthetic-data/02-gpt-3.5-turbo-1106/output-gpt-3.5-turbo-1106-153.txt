prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: Serine/threonine-protein phosphatase 2A. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, the role of the Serine/threonine-protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) complex in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease was investigated. Utilizing a transgenic mouse model, we observed a dysregulation of PP2A activity in the brains of affected animals. Subsequent biochemical analyses revealed altered phosphorylation patterns of the tau protein, a pivotal player in the formation of neurofibrillary tangles characteristic of Alzheimer's disease. Furthermore, treatment with a novel small molecule PP2A modulator resulted in a reduction of tau hyperphosphorylation and amelioration of cognitive deficits in the transgenic mice. These findings suggest that targeting the PP2A complex may hold promise for therapeutic intervention in Alzheimer's disease.
