prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: ribonuclease P. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: Ribonuclease P is a ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complex that plays a crucial role in tRNA processing in various organisms. This complex is composed of a catalytic RNA subunit and multiple protein components, and is involved in the endonucleolytic cleavage of precursor tRNA molecules. Dysregulation of ribonuclease P activity has been implicated in several human diseases, including neurodegenerative disorders and cancer. Additionally, the function and structure of ribonuclease P have been studied across different species, revealing conserved features and mechanisms. Understanding the molecular details of this complex may provide insights into potential therapeutic strategies targeting tRNA processing pathways in diseases related to ribonuclease P dysfunction.
