prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: laminin-10. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In recent years, studies investigating the role of laminin-10 have shed light on its significance in the pathogenesis of multiple sclerosis. Laminin-10, a basement membrane glycoprotein, has been implicated in the interaction between immune cells and the blood-brain barrier in the context of multiple sclerosis. Furthermore, experimental evidence suggests that laminin-10 levels are dynamically regulated during the progression of the disease, indicating its potential as a biomarker for disease activity and progression. Given the critical role of laminin-10 in mediating immune cell trafficking across the blood-brain barrier, targeting this protein complex may offer promising therapeutic avenues for managing multiple sclerosis and related conditions.
