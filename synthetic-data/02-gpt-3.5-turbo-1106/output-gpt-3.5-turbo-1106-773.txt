prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: NEF3. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we investigated the regulatory role of NEF3 in the context of Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathogenesis. Our findings demonstrate a significant upregulation of NEF3 expression in the hippocampal tissue of AD patients compared to healthy controls. Furthermore, we identified a potential interaction between NEF3 and amyloid beta peptides, a hallmark feature of AD pathology. Through in vitro experiments using neural cell cultures, we observed that NEF3 inhibition led to a reduction in amyloid beta-induced neurotoxicity, suggesting a potential neuroprotective role for NEF3 in AD. These results provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying AD pathogenesis and point to the potential therapeutic relevance of targeting NEF3 for the treatment of AD.
