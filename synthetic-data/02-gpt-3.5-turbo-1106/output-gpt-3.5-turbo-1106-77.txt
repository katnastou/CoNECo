prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: cardiac PLN. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we investigated the involvement of cardiac PLN in the pathogenesis of cardiomyopathy in a murine model. We found that mice overexpressing cardiac PLN exhibited significant signs of ventricular hypertrophy and reduced cardiac function, consistent with the phenotype observed in human patients with dilated cardiomyopathy. Additionally, we observed dysregulation of calcium handling in the cardiomyocytes of the transgenic mice, with an increase in intracellular calcium levels and impaired contractility. These findings suggest a potential role for cardiac PLN in the development of heart failure and may provide insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying the pathophysiology of cardiomyopathy. Further studies are warranted to elucidate the specific signaling pathways and interactions involving cardiac PLN that contribute to the progression of cardiomyopathy.
