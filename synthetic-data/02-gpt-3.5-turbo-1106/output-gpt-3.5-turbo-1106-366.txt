prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: IlvBN. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we investigated the impact of the IlvBN protein complex on the development of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) in a murine model. Our findings revealed a significant downregulation of IlvBN expression in liver tissue from mice with advanced NAFLD compared to healthy controls. Subsequent analysis of metabolites revealed dysregulation of key pathways associated with lipid metabolism and insulin sensitivity in the absence of functional IlvBN. Furthermore, administration of a small molecule activator of IlvBN resulted in attenuation of hepatic steatosis and improved glucose tolerance in the NAFLD model. These results suggest a potential therapeutic role for IlvBN modulation in mitigating NAFLD-associated metabolic dysregulation.
