prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: miRLC. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: This study investigated the potential role of the miRLC protein complex in the pathogenesis of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). We utilized a murine model of cigarette smoke-induced lung injury to assess the expression and function of miRLC in the lung tissue. Our results demonstrate a significant upregulation of miRLC in the bronchial epithelial cells of the smoke-exposed mice compared to the control group. Furthermore, we observed a positive correlation between the severity of airway obstruction and the expression levels of miRLC. These findings suggest that miRLC may be implicated in the development and progression of COPD, and highlight its potential as a therapeutic target for mitigating the pulmonary consequences of cigarette smoke exposure.
