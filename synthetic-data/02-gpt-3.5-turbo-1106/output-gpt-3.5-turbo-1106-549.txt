prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: pyroptosome. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: Recent research has demonstrated the pivotal role of the pyroptosome in the initiation and propagation of inflammatory responses in various diseases. The pyroptosome consists of multiple protein subunits that assemble in response to pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) or damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) during infection or tissue injury. Additionally, the activation of the pyroptosome leads to the formation of membrane pores, resulting in the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines and the eventual induction of pyroptotic cell death. Dysregulation of pyroptosome-mediated pathways has been implicated in the pathogenesis of inflammatory conditions such as sepsis, autoimmune disorders, and neurodegenerative diseases. Hence, targeting the pyroptosome presents a promising therapeutic strategy for ameliorating inflammatory responses and associated diseases.
