prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: UTP-C. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The UTP-C protein complex is a critical component of the ribosomal RNA processing machinery in eukaryotic cells. Previous studies have shown that mutations in UTP-C are associated with disrupted ribosome biogenesis and altered protein synthesis, leading to various human diseases, including Diamond-Blackfan anemia and certain congenital heart defects. In this study, we investigated the interaction between UTP-C and a novel small molecule inhibitor in human cell lines. Our results demonstrate that the small molecule disrupts the assembly of UTP-C, resulting in significant inhibition of ribosomal RNA processing and impaired cell proliferation. These findings provide important insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying UTP-C function and potential therapeutic targets for diseases associated with UTP-C dysfunction.
