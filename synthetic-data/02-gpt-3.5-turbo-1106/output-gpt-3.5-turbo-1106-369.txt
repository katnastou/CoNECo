prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: MMXD. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we investigated the role of the MMXD protein complex in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease. Our results demonstrate a significant upregulation of MMXD expression in the substantia nigra of Parkinson's disease patients compared to healthy controls. Using a murine model, we further elucidated the impact of MMXD on mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress, hallmark features of Parkinson's disease. Additionally, we identified a novel small molecule inhibitor that effectively disrupted the interaction between MMXD and its binding partners, leading to amelioration of motor deficits and dopaminergic neuron degeneration in the animal model. These findings highlight the potential of targeting the MMXD protein complex as a promising therapeutic strategy for Parkinson's disease.
