prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: MalFGK2. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we investigated the role of the MalFGK2 protein complex in the context of Escherichia coli infection. We observed significant upregulation of the MalFGK2 complex in response to glucose uptake during infection, suggesting a potential link between the complex and bacterial virulence. Our results also revealed a correlation between MalFGK2 expression and the progression of E. coli-induced urinary tract infections in murine models. Furthermore, our findings indicate that targeting the MalFGK2 complex could offer a promising avenue for developing novel therapeutic strategies against E. coli-associated uropathogenic infections. This study sheds light on the potential of the MalFGK2 complex as a target for drug development in the context of bacterial infection.
