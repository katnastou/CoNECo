prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: DiaA. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we investigated the role of the DiaA protein complex in the pathogenesis of antibiotic-resistant strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Our results revealed a direct interaction between DiaA and the transcription factor X, which regulates the expression of key genes involved in drug resistance. Furthermore, our findings demonstrated that inhibition of the DiaA complex using a specific small molecule led to a significant decrease in bacterial viability, suggesting that targeting DiaA may represent a promising strategy for combatting multidrug-resistant tuberculosis. These results shed light on the potential therapeutic value of targeting DiaA in the context of antibiotic resistance in M. tuberculosis.
