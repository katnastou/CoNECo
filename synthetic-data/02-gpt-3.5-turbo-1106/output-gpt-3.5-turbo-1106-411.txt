prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: Pol-zeta4. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The Pol-zeta4 protein complex has been shown to play a pivotal role in mediating DNA damage tolerance and maintaining genome stability. Recent studies have implicated the involvement of Pol-zeta4 in the error-prone translesion synthesis pathway, allowing the replication machinery to bypass the presence of DNA lesions. Emerging evidence suggests that perturbations in Pol-zeta4 function may contribute to the development of various diseases, including cancer, by promoting the accumulation of genomic mutations. Furthermore, the identification of small molecule modulators targeting Pol-zeta4 holds promise for the development of novel therapeutic strategies aimed at mitigating the deleterious effects of DNA damage. This underscores the importance of further elucidating the molecular mechanisms and cellular functions associated with Pol-zeta4 to inform the development of targeted interventions for diseases characterized by genomic instability.
