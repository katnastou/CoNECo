prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: AMT1. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In recent years, the understanding of nitrogen assimilation in plants has been greatly advanced through the study of the AMT1 protein complex. This complex is essential for the transport of ammonium ions across the plasma membrane in various plant species. The controlled uptake of ammonium is crucial for maintaining nitrogen homeostasis and plays a pivotal role in plant growth and development. Mutations in AMT1 have been associated with impaired nitrogen utilization in plants, highlighting its critical function in nitrogen acquisition and metabolism. The discovery of small molecule modulators that influence the activity of AMT1 has provided valuable insights into the regulation of ammonium transport in plants. These findings have far-reaching implications for agricultural practices and hold promise for the development of novel strategies to improve nitrogen use efficiency in crop plants.
