prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: DNA polymerase V. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we investigated the role of DNA polymerase V in the repair of UV-induced DNA damage in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Our results demonstrate that DNA polymerase V plays a crucial role in the bypass of UV-induced DNA lesions, contributing to the survival of yeast cells exposed to UV radiation. Furthermore, we found that the absence of DNA polymerase V led to an increased frequency of mutagenesis in UV-damaged DNA, suggesting a potential link between DNA polymerase V activity and the prevention of UV-induced mutagenesis. These findings shed light on the importance of DNA polymerase V in maintaining genome integrity in response to UV radiation, and may have implications for understanding the mechanisms of UV-induced carcinogenesis in eukaryotic organisms.
