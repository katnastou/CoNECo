prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: FMN reductase. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The FMN reductase protein complex, also known as flavin mononucleotide reductase, plays a crucial role in the reduction of flavin mononucleotide (FMN) to form flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD). This enzymatic reaction is essential for the proper functioning of various metabolic pathways in organisms, including humans. Studies have shown that dysfunction or impaired activity of the FMN reductase complex is associated with metabolic disorders such as riboflavin deficiency and certain mitochondrial diseases. The regulation and function of FMN reductase have been extensively investigated in various model organisms, including mice and yeast, aiming to gain insights into its potential as a therapeutic target for metabolic disorders. Understanding the mechanistic details of FMN reductase activity and its role in cellular metabolism is crucial for the development of novel treatments for diseases related to riboflavin metabolism.
