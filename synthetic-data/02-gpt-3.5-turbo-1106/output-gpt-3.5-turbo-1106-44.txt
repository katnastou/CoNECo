prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: SSB. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The SSB protein complex has been widely recognized for its pivotal role in the maintenance of genomic stability and protection against DNA damage. Recent studies have shed light on the complex's interactions with various DNA repair pathways, including nucleotide excision repair and homologous recombination. Additionally, aberrant regulation of the SSB complex has been associated with increased susceptibility to certain hereditary cancer syndromes, such as Li-Fraumeni syndrome and neurofibromatosis type 1. Furthermore, investigation into the potential therapeutic targeting of the SSB complex in the context of cancer treatment holds promise for the development of novel strategies aimed at enhancing DNA repair fidelity and minimizing the emergence of drug resistance. These findings underscore the significance of the SSB complex as a critical guardian of genomic integrity and a potential druggable target for combating cancer progression.
