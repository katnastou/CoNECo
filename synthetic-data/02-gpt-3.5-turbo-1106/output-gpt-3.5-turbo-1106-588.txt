prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: dynactin. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we aimed to investigate the role of dynactin in the pathogenesis of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Using a transgenic mouse model overexpressing mutant SOD1, we observed a significant decrease in dynactin levels in the spinal cord neurons of affected mice compared to wild-type controls. Furthermore, our immunohistochemical analysis revealed abnormal aggregation of dynactin within the neuronal cytoplasm of ALS mice, suggesting disrupted cellular trafficking processes. In addition, electron microscopy analysis demonstrated ultrastructural abnormalities in the axonal transport system associated with dynactin depletion. Our findings suggest a potential link between dynactin dysfunction and the motor neuron degeneration characteristic of ALS, highlighting the importance of further investigations into the molecular mechanisms underlying dynactin pathology in neurodegenerative diseases.
