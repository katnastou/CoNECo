prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: Bag6. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The protein complex Bag6 has garnered significant attention in recent years due to its critical role in the cellular proteostasis network. Bag6 has been demonstrated to interact with various client proteins, including misfolded or nascent polypeptides, to facilitate their proper folding, prevent their aggregation, or target them for degradation. In addition to its chaperone-like activities, Bag6 has been implicated in the regulation of apoptosis, immune response, and cellular stress signaling pathways. Furthermore, dysregulation of Bag6 has been associated with a variety of human diseases, such as neurodegenerative disorders and cancer. As such, further investigation into the molecular mechanisms underlying the functions of Bag6 and its potential as a therapeutic target is crucial for the development of novel treatment strategies for these debilitating conditions.
