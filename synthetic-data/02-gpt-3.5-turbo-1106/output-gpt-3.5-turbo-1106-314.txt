prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: PUMA-BCL-2. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: Recent studies have implicated the PUMA-BCL-2 protein complex in the regulation of apoptosis, providing a potential target for cancer therapy. In this study, we investigated the interaction between PUMA and BCL-2 in breast cancer cells. We found that the expression levels of PUMA and BCL-2 were significantly dysregulated in breast cancer tissues compared to normal tissues. Furthermore, chemical inhibition of the PUMA-BCL-2 complex using a novel small molecule inhibitor resulted in a significant increase in apoptosis in breast cancer cells. Our findings suggest that targeting the PUMA-BCL-2 complex may hold promise for developing new therapeutic strategies for breast cancer.
