prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: mitotic septin. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The role of the mitotic septin protein complex in cancer progression has been an area of intense research in recent years. Studies have shown that dysregulation of the mitotic septin complex is associated with aberrant cell division, leading to genomic instability and ultimately promoting tumorigenesis. Additionally, mutations in the genes encoding the mitotic septin complex have been identified in various cancer types, including breast cancer, colorectal cancer, and leukemia. Furthermore, targeting the mitotic septin complex with small molecule inhibitors has shown promise in preclinical models, suggesting that this complex may serve as a potential therapeutic target for cancer treatment. Overall, understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying the function of the mitotic septin complex in cancer development holds significant promise for the development of novel targeted therapies for cancer patients.
