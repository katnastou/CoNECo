prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: DOM-A.C. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we investigated the role of the DOM-A.C protein complex in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease. Using a transgenic mouse model, we observed a significant upregulation of DOM-A.C expression in the hippocampus, a region of the brain crucial for memory and learning, in comparison to wild-type controls. Furthermore, our findings revealed a strong correlation between elevated DOM-A.C levels and the accumulation of amyloid-beta plaques, a hallmark feature of Alzheimer's disease pathology. In addition, we identified a novel small molecule inhibitor that effectively downregulated DOM-A.C activity in neuronal cell cultures, leading to a reduction in amyloid-beta production. Our results suggest that targeting DOM-A.C may represent a promising therapeutic strategy for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease.
