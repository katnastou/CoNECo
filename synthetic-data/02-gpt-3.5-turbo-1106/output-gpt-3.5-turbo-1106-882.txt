prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: HIR. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The HIR protein complex plays a crucial role in gene regulation and chromatin remodeling in eukaryotic organisms. Previous studies have indicated that the HIR complex is involved in the maintenance of heterochromatin integrity and silencing of genes. In addition, recent research has suggested that the HIR complex may be implicated in the cellular response to DNA damage. Such findings underscore the intriguing potential of targeting the HIR complex in the development of novel therapeutic strategies for conditions associated with aberrant gene expression and chromatin dysregulation, including various cancers and neurodegenerative disorders. Further investigations into the molecular mechanisms underlying the function of the HIR complex are warranted to fully elucidate its role in cellular homeostasis and disease pathogenesis.
