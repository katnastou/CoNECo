prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: dimeric IgA immunoglobulin. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we aimed to investigate the role of the dimeric IgA immunoglobulin in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Utilizing a murine model of colitis, we examined the levels of dimeric IgA immunoglobulin in the gut mucosa and its potential correlation with disease severity. Our results demonstrated a significant increase in dimeric IgA immunoglobulin concentration in the inflamed tissues of mice with colitis compared to healthy controls. Furthermore, we observed an association between elevated dimeric IgA immunoglobulin levels and the presence of dysbiosis in the gut microbiota. Our findings suggest that dimeric IgA immunoglobulin may play a crucial role in the modulation of gut homeostasis and the pathogenesis of IBD, shedding light on potential therapeutic targets for this debilitating condition.
