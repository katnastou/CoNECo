prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: NPHP. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The NPHP protein complex has been implicated in various genetic disorders, particularly in the context of renal ciliopathies. Mutations in genes encoding components of the NPHP complex have been linked to the development of numerous renal and extra-renal manifestations, including nephronophthisis, retinal degeneration, and hepatic fibrosis. Further investigation into the interactions and functions of the NPHP complex may provide crucial insights into the underlying pathophysiology of these conditions, and could potentially unveil novel therapeutic targets for the management of these disorders. Thus, understanding the regulatory mechanisms and molecular pathways involving the NPHP complex holds significant promise for advancing the clinical management and treatment of ciliopathy-related diseases.
