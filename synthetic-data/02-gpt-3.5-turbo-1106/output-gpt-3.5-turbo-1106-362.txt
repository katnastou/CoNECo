prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: nucleotide-excision repair factor 2. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: Nucleotide-excision repair factor 2 (NEF2) is a pivotal player in the cellular response to DNA damage, and is essential for the recognition and removal of bulky DNA lesions induced by various chemical carcinogens and environmental mutagens. Defects in NEF2 have been associated with the pathogenesis of xeroderma pigmentosum, a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by extreme sensitivity to ultraviolet (UV) radiation and a markedly increased risk of developing skin cancer. It has also been implicated in the repair of DNA damage caused by platinum-based chemotherapeutic agents, illustrating its crucial role in cancer treatment. Furthermore, NEF2 has been shown to contribute to the cellular defense against oxidative stress, highlighting its potential relevance to neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's and Alzheimer's. Given its multifaceted roles in maintaining genomic integrity and cellular homeostasis, NEF2 represents a promising target for therapeutic interventions aiming to mitigate the deleterious effects of DNA damage and combat various disease states associated with defective DNA repair mechanisms.
