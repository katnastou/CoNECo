prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: FHL. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: Our research aimed to investigate the role of the FHL protein complex in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease. In this study, we examined the interaction between FHL and amyloid beta, a key protein implicated in the development of Alzheimer's disease. Our findings demonstrated a direct binding between FHL and amyloid beta, suggesting a potential regulatory role of FHL in amyloid beta aggregation and neurotoxicity. Furthermore, our results showed that FHL levels were significantly elevated in the brains of Alzheimer's disease patients compared to healthy controls, indicating a potential involvement of FHL in disease progression. This study provides new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying Alzheimer's disease and highlights the potential therapeutic implications of targeting the FHL protein complex.
