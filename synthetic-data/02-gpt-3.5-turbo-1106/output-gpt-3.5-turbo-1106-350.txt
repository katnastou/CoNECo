prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: MARS. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The MARS protein complex, consisting of MARS1 and MARS2 subunits, has garnered significant attention in the context of mitochondrial function and neurodegenerative diseases. Previous studies have demonstrated that the dysregulation of MARS complex activity is linked to impaired mitochondrial translation and energy production, culminating in cellular dysfunction. Furthermore, the downregulation of MARS complex expression has been implicated in the pathogenesis of disorders such as Parkinson's disease and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Recent investigations have also identified small molecule modulators that selectively target the MARS complex, offering potential therapeutic avenues for combating mitochondrial dysfunction in neurodegenerative disorders. Given the critical role of the MARS complex in maintaining mitochondrial homeostasis, further exploration of its regulatory mechanisms and associated therapeutic targets is imperative for the development of novel intervention strategies.
