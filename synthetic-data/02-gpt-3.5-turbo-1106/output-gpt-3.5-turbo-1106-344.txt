prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: HCN4 channel. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we sought to investigate the potential role of the HCN4 channel in the pathogenesis of atrial fibrillation. A series of experiments were performed utilizing a murine model of atrial fibrillation, as well as in vitro assays using human cardiac cells. The results revealed a significant upregulation of HCN4 channel expression in atrial tissue obtained from patients with atrial fibrillation compared to healthy controls. Furthermore, pharmacological blockade of the HCN4 channel using a specific inhibitor resulted in a reduction in the duration and frequency of arrhythmias in the murine model. These findings suggest a potential involvement of the HCN4 channel in the development and maintenance of atrial fibrillation, highlighting its therapeutic implications for the management of this prevalent cardiac arrhythmia.
