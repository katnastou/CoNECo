prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: IL-4 receptor. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The IL-4 receptor is a crucial component of the signaling network involved in the pathology of allergic diseases, such as asthma and atopic dermatitis. In this study, we aimed to investigate the role of the IL-4 receptor in regulating cytokine production and immune cell activation in a murine model of allergic airway inflammation. To this end, we employed a combination of genetic knockout models and pharmacological inhibition of the IL-4 receptor. Our results demonstrated that blocking the IL-4 receptor led to a significant reduction in Th2 cytokine levels, including IL-4 and IL-13, as well as a decreased recruitment of eosinophils and mast cells to the airways. These findings highlight the potential of targeting the IL-4 receptor as a therapeutic strategy for the treatment of allergic respiratory diseases.
