prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: TCTC. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The TCTC protein complex has emerged as a critical mediator of cellular responses in various disease states. Recent findings have implicated TCTC in the regulation of inflammatory processes associated with rheumatoid arthritis. Moreover, the interaction between TCTC and the chemical mediator prostaglandin E2 has been shown to modulate the severity of colitis in murine models. Additionally, TCTC has been implicated in the development of certain types of cancer, including ovarian carcinoma. These findings underscore the significance of TCTC in diverse pathological conditions and warrant further investigation into its potential as a target for therapeutic interventions.
