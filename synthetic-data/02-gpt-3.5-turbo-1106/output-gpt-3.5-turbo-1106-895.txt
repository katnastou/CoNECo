prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: PDH. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) complex plays a crucial role in the regulation of glucose metabolism in various organisms. Dysregulation of the PDH complex has been linked to metabolic diseases such as diabetes and obesity. Recent studies have identified small molecule inhibitors that target specific enzymatic activities within the PDH complex, offering potential therapeutic strategies for metabolic disorders. Additionally, the interaction between PDH and specific transcription factors has been implicated in the regulation of gene expression related to glucose homeostasis. Further research into the PDH complex holds promise for identifying novel therapeutic targets and developing personalized treatments for metabolic diseases.
