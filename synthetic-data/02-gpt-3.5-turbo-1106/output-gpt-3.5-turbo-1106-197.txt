prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: ESCRT I. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The ESCRT I protein complex plays a critical role in the process of multivesicular body (MVB) formation and the subsequent sorting of ubiquitinated membrane proteins for lysosomal degradation. Dysfunction of ESCRT I has been implicated in the pathogenesis of various diseases, including neurodegenerative disorders and viral infections. Recent studies have highlighted the involvement of ESCRT I in the regulation of cytokinesis and the maintenance of cellular homeostasis. Furthermore, small molecule inhibitors targeting ESCRT I have shown promise as potential therapeutic agents for the treatment of certain cancers by disrupting endosomal sorting and trafficking pathways. Understanding the intricate mechanisms underlying the function of ESCRT I is crucial for developing novel strategies to modulate its activity and combat diseases associated with dysregulated protein degradation and cellular trafficking processes.
