prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: ODA-DC. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we elucidate the role of the ODA-DC protein complex in the pathogenesis of primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD), a genetically heterogeneous disorder characterized by impaired ciliary motility. Using a murine model of PCD, we demonstrate that disruption of ODA-DC leads to aberrant ciliary beat frequency and mucociliary clearance, recapitulating the clinical phenotype observed in PCD patients. Furthermore, we identify small molecule modulators of ODA-DC activity that ameliorate ciliary dysfunction, offering potential therapeutic avenues for the management of PCD. Our findings shed light on the crucial contribution of ODA-DC to ciliary function and pave the way for the development of targeted interventions for PCD.
