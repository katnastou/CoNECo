prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: T6SS. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: Recent studies have implicated the bacterial Type VI Secretion System (T6SS) in the pathogenesis of various infectious diseases. The T6SS is a complex multi-protein assembly that confers a competitive advantage to its host bacteria, aiding in the colonization of host tissues and evasion of the host immune response. In several human pathogens, such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Vibrio cholerae, the T6SS has been shown to play a crucial role in virulence and interbacterial competition. Furthermore, dysregulation of the T6SS has been linked to increased susceptibility to various infectious diseases, highlighting the potential of targeting this protein complex as a novel therapeutic strategy. Understanding the molecular mechanisms that govern T6SS assembly and function may pave the way for the development of new antimicrobial agents and vaccines targeting pathogenic bacteria.
