prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: Sm. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The Sm protein complex plays a crucial role in the splicing of pre-mRNA molecules. Dysfunction of this complex has been linked to a variety of autoimmune diseases, including systemic lupus erythematosus and Sj√∂gren's syndrome. Recent studies have implicated the Sm complex in the development of cancer, with aberrant expression patterns observed in several tumor types. Furthermore, small molecule inhibitors targeting the Sm complex have shown promise as potential therapeutic agents in preclinical models of cancer. Understanding the molecular mechanisms governing the function of the Sm complex is essential for the development of targeted therapies for diseases associated with its dysregulation.
