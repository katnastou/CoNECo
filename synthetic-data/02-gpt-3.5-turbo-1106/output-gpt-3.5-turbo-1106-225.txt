prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: IscA. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, the role of the IscA protein complex in the pathogenesis of iron-sulfur cluster biogenesis disorders was investigated. Using an animal model system, we observed a significant correlation between IscA expression levels and the onset of mitochondrial dysfunction associated with iron-sulfur cluster assembly. Furthermore, chemical inhibition of IscA activity led to a cascade of cellular events, including aberrant iron metabolism and increased oxidative stress, ultimately culminating in the manifestation of diseases such as sideroblastic anemia and neurodegenerative disorders. These findings shed light on the critical involvement of the IscA protein complex in maintaining cellular homeostasis and underscore its potential as a therapeutic target for mitigating iron-sulfur cluster-related pathologies.
