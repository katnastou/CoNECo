prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: KEOPSs. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The KEOPSs protein complex has been recently implicated in the pathogenesis of a diverse array of human diseases. This complex has been shown to play a crucial role in the regulation of cellular processes related to growth and division. Genetic studies in model organisms have demonstrated that mutations in the KEOPSs complex result in severe developmental defects and embryonic lethality. Furthermore, aberrant expression of the KEOPSs complex has been associated with a spectrum of diseases, including cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, and metabolic syndromes. As such, targeting the activity of the KEOPSs complex may hold promise as a therapeutic strategy for addressing these debilitating conditions. Further investigation into the molecular mechanisms underlying the function of the KEOPSs complex is warranted in order to elucidate its potential as a target for pharmacological intervention.
