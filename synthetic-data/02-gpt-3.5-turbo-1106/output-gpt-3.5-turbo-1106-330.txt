prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: WASP and Scar homologue. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The cytoskeleton plays a critical role in regulating cell morphology, motility, and intracellular signaling pathways. The WASP and Scar homologue (WASH) protein complex has been shown to regulate actin nucleation and branching, contributing to the structural dynamics of the cytoskeleton. Dysregulation of the WASH complex has been associated with various human diseases, including neurodevelopmental disorders and cancer metastasis. Additionally, small molecule inhibitors targeting the WASH complex have shown promise in preclinical studies for the treatment of metastatic cancer. Further understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying WASH complex function may provide new insights into therapeutic interventions for diseases associated with cytoskeletal abnormalities.
