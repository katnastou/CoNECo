prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: eIF-3. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The eukaryotic translation initiation factor 3 (eIF-3) protein complex plays a crucial role in the regulation of protein synthesis and cell growth. Dysregulation of this complex has been implicated in various malignancies, including breast cancer and leukemia. Recent studies have demonstrated that targeting the interaction between eIF-3 and its binding partners may have therapeutic potential in cancer treatment. In addition, the identification of small molecules that modulate the function of eIF-3 has paved the way for novel drug development strategies. Further understanding of the precise mechanisms underlying the eIF-3 complex's functions will likely provide valuable insights into both normal physiological processes and disease pathogenesis, ultimately leading to the development of targeted therapies for cancer and other diseases involving aberrant protein translation.
