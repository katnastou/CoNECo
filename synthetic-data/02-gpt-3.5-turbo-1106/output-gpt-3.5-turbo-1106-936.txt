prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: GATOR1. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The GATOR1 complex has garnered significant attention for its crucial role in the regulation of cellular nutrient sensing and growth control pathways. Comprising Npr2, Npr3, Depdc5, and others, the GATOR1 complex is known to interact with the GATOR2 complex to modulate the activity of the mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1). Dysregulation of mTOR signaling has been implicated in various pathologies, including cancer, metabolic disorders, and neurodevelopmental syndromes. Recent studies have highlighted the involvement of GATOR1 dysfunction in the pathogenesis of certain neurodevelopmental disorders, shedding light on potential therapeutic targets for these conditions. Understanding the intricate molecular mechanisms underlying GATOR1 function may offer promising avenues for the development of novel treatments targeting mTOR-related diseases.
