prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: Lid2. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The role of the Lid2 protein complex in mediating cellular response to oxidative stress has emerged as an area of significant interest in recent studies. In the presence of increased reactive oxygen species, Lid2 is observed to modulate the expression of several key antioxidant enzymes, including superoxide dismutase and catalase, thereby influencing the overall intracellular redox balance. Furthermore, studies have shown that Lid2 levels are upregulated in response to oxidative stress in both yeast and mammalian cells, suggesting its conservation across species. Dysregulation of Lid2 has been implicated in several age-related neurodegenerative disorders, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target for mitigating oxidative stress-related pathologies. Further investigation into the molecular mechanisms underlying the function of Lid2 may elucidate novel avenues for intervention in oxidative stress-related diseases.
