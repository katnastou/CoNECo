prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: alphav-beta1 integrin. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The role of the alphav-beta1 integrin protein complex in regulating cell adhesion and migration processes is of great interest in the study of cancer metastasis. Previous research has shown that the interaction between alphav-beta1 integrin and fibronectin can mediate tumor cell dissemination and invasion within the tumor microenvironment. In addition, the upregulation of alphav-beta1 integrin has been associated with increased aggressiveness of ovarian cancer, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target for this disease. Furthermore, studies in animal models have suggested that small molecule inhibitors of alphav-beta1 integrin can effectively reduce the metastatic potential of cancer cells, providing a promising avenue for future targeted therapies. Overall, the elucidation of the mechanisms underlying alphav-beta1 integrin-mediated tumor progression holds significant implications for the development of novel anti-cancer treatments.
