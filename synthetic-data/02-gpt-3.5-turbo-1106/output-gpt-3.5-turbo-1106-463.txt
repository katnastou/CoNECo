prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: HCab. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In recent years, there has been growing interest in understanding the role of HCab in the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases. HCab, a complex formed by the interaction of two specific proteins, has been implicated in the regulation of immune responses and the development of autoimmunity. Studies have shown that HCab is associated with increased inflammation and tissue damage in diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis and systemic lupus erythematosus. Furthermore, HCab levels have been found to be elevated in patients with these conditions, suggesting a potential biomarker for disease activity. Targeting HCab may thus offer a promising avenue for the development of novel therapeutic approaches for autoimmune disorders. Further investigation into the molecular mechanisms underlying the involvement of HCab in autoimmune diseases is warranted to uncover potential therapeutic targets for intervention.
