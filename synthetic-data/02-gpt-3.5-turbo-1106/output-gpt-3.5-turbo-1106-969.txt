prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: F1-Fo ATP synthase. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we investigated the role of the F1-Fo ATP synthase complex in the context of mitochondrial dysfunction and its association with aging-related diseases. Through a series of experiments using a mouse model, we demonstrated a decline in the activity and expression of the F1-Fo ATP synthase complex in aged individuals. Furthermore, we observed a significant correlation between the diminished function of the F1-Fo ATP synthase complex and the development of age-related mitochondrial disorders, such as mitochondrial encephalopathy and myopathy. These findings suggest a potential link between the dysregulation of the F1-Fo ATP synthase complex and age-related mitochondrial dysfunction, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target for the treatment of age-associated diseases.
