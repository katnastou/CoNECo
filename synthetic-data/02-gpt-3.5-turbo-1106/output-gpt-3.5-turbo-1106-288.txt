prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: alpha7-beta1 integrin. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In recent years, the role of the alpha7-beta1 integrin protein complex in skeletal muscle regeneration has garnered significant attention. Studies have demonstrated that the binding of this integrin complex to its extracellular matrix ligands plays a crucial role in mediating myoblast adhesion, migration, and differentiation. Furthermore, investigation into the downstream signaling pathways following alpha7-beta1 integrin activation has revealed its involvement in regulating gene expression, cytoskeletal organization, and myogenic fusion. Dysregulation of alpha7-beta1 integrin signaling has been implicated in various neuromuscular disorders, such as muscular dystrophy and sarcopenia. Targeting this integrin complex provides a promising avenue for the development of therapeutic interventions aimed at promoting muscle regeneration and ameliorating muscle wasting conditions.
