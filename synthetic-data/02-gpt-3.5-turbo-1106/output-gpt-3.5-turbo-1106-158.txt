model: gpt-3.5-turbo-1106
prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: mglABC. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: Recent research has shed light on the involvement of the mglABC protein complex in the pathogenesis of tuberculosis. Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the causative agent of tuberculosis, is a major global health concern with a high mortality rate. The mglABC complex has been identified as a key player in the transport and metabolism of glycerol, which is essential for the survival and replication of M. tuberculosis within the host. Studies have shown that disruption of the mglABC complex leads to impaired glycerol uptake, resulting in reduced bacterial growth and virulence. Understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying the function of the mglABC complex could provide valuable insights for the development of novel antitubercular therapies targeting glycerol metabolism.
