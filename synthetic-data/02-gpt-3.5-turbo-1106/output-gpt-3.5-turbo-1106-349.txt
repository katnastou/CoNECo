prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: IgD immunoglobulins. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In our study, we aimed to investigate the role of IgD immunoglobulins in the pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Our results revealed a significant upregulation of IgD immunoglobulins in serum samples from RA patients compared to healthy controls. Furthermore, we observed a positive correlation between IgD immunoglobulins levels and disease severity as determined by clinical and radiographic assessments. Additionally, in vitro experiments demonstrated that IgD immunoglobulins can potentiate the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines in synovial fibroblasts, suggesting a potential mechanistic link between IgD immunoglobulins and the inflammatory processes driving RA. These findings underscore the potential of targeting IgD immunoglobulins as a novel therapeutic strategy for RA.
