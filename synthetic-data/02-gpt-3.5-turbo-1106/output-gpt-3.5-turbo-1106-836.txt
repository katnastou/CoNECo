prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: ribonuclease MRP. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: Ribonuclease MRP (RNase MRP) is a multifunctional ribonucleoprotein complex involved in the processing of RNA in eukaryotic cells. Its dysregulation has been implicated in various human diseases, including cartilage-hair hypoplasia and familial dyskeratosis congenita. Previous studies have suggested that RNase MRP may play a role in the regulation of telomere length, which is critically important in cellular senescence and cancer development. Furthermore, small molecule inhibitors targeting RNase MRP have shown promise in preclinical models of tumorigenesis, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target for cancer treatment. However, further research is warranted to elucidate the precise regulatory mechanisms of RNase MRP and its potential implications in disease pathogenesis.
