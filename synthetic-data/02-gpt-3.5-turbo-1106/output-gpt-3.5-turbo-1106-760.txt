prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: LSH. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The nucleosome remodeling and deacetylase (NuRD) complex is a key regulator of gene expression and chromatin structure. One of the essential components of the NuRD complex is the lymphoid-specific helicase (LSH). Studies have demonstrated that LSH plays a critical role in maintaining genomic stability and regulating DNA methylation. Dysregulation of LSH has been associated with various human diseases, including cancer and neurodevelopmental disorders. Understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying the function of LSH within the NuRD complex is essential for elucidating its physiological and pathological significance. Furthermore, targeting LSH and the NuRD complex may offer potential therapeutic avenues for treating diseases associated with aberrant chromatin remodeling and epigenetic modifications.
