prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: IL-3 receptor. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The IL-3 receptor plays a crucial role in the regulation of hematopoiesis and immune function. This protein complex is composed of IL-3 receptor α and IL-3 receptor β subunits, which form a high-affinity receptor for the cytokine IL-3. IL-3 receptor signaling has been implicated in a variety of pathological conditions, including asthma, leukemia, and autoimmune diseases. Recent studies have shed light on the intricate molecular mechanisms underlying IL-3 receptor activation and downstream signaling pathways, providing valuable insights for the development of targeted therapies. Further research on the IL-3 receptor complex is warranted to elucidate its potential as a therapeutic target for a range of clinical conditions.
