prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: laminin-8. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: Recent studies have highlighted the crucial role of laminin-8 in the development and progression of diabetic nephropathy, a common complication of diabetes characterized by progressive kidney damage. Laminin-8, a heterotrimeric extracellular matrix protein complex, has been shown to modulate cellular adhesion, migration, and signaling events in the kidney microenvironment. Moreover, its aberrant expression has been implicated in the disruption of glomerular basement membranes, contributing to the pathogenesis of diabetic nephropathy. This compelling evidence underscores the potential of laminin-8 as a promising therapeutic target for mitigating the renal complications associated with diabetes. Further elucidating the molecular mechanisms underlying the involvement of laminin-8 in diabetic nephropathy may pave the way for the development of novel therapeutic interventions to alleviate the burden of this debilitating disease.
