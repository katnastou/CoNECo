prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: Fc-gamma receptor III. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we investigated the role of Fc-gamma receptor III (FcγRIII) in the pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis. We analyzed serum samples from patients with rheumatoid arthritis and healthy controls to measure the levels of inflammatory cytokines and immunoglobulin G (IgG) immune complexes. Additionally, we conducted a series of in vitro experiments using human monocyte-derived macrophages to discern the specific binding and activation interactions between FcγRIII and IgG immune complexes. Our findings revealed a significant upregulation of FcγRIII expression in the synovial tissue of rheumatoid arthritis patients, indicating a potential link between FcγRIII-mediated immune complex activation and joint inflammation. These results provide new insights into the role of FcγRIII in the pathophysiology of rheumatoid arthritis and may offer potential therapeutic targets for the treatment of this chronic inflammatory disease.
