prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: MMM1. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we aimed to investigate the role of the protein complex MMM1 in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease. Our research involved analyzing post-mortem brain tissue samples from Parkinson's disease patients and control individuals. Using immunohistochemistry and Western blotting techniques, we observed a significant upregulation of MMM1 in the substantia nigra region of the Parkinson's disease brains compared to controls. Furthermore, we conducted in vitro experiments using human neuronal cell lines and treated with different neurotoxins to induce Parkinson's disease-like pathology. Our results showed that downregulation of MMM1 using siRNA significantly ameliorated the neurotoxin-induced cytotoxicity, indicating a potential involvement of MMM1 in the neurodegenerative processes associated with Parkinson's disease. Overall, our findings suggest that MMM1 may serve as a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of Parkinson's disease.
