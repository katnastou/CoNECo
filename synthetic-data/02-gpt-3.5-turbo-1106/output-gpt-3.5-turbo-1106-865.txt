prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: eukaryotic translation initiation factor 3. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: Our study aimed to investigate the role of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 3 (eIF3) in the pathogenesis of colorectal cancer. We employed a series of in vitro experiments using human colorectal cancer cell lines to elucidate the impact of eIF3 on cellular proliferation and migration. Expression levels of eIF3 were found to be significantly upregulated in colorectal cancer tissues compared to adjacent normal mucosa, implicating its potential involvement in tumorigenesis. Additionally, we examined the interaction between eIF3 and key signaling pathways, such as the mTOR and MAPK pathways, that are known to contribute to cancer progression. Our findings suggest that eIF3 may play a crucial role in promoting colorectal cancer development by modulating these signaling cascades. Further mechanistic studies are warranted to fully elucidate the precise contribution of eIF3 to colorectal cancer progression, with the ultimate goal of identifying potential therapeutic targets for this disease.
