prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: embryonic stem cell-specific BAF. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we investigated the role of the embryonic stem cell-specific BAF complex in the regulation of pluripotency in murine embryonic stem cells. We identified a key interaction between the embryonic stem cell-specific BAF complex and Oct4, Nanog, and Sox2, which are essential pluripotency transcription factors. Through chromatin immunoprecipitation assays, we demonstrated that the embryonic stem cell-specific BAF complex directly binds to the regulatory regions of these transcription factors, facilitating their transcriptional activation. Furthermore, our findings suggest that the embryonic stem cell-specific BAF complex is involved in maintaining the undifferentiated state of embryonic stem cells, with implications for understanding developmental processes and potential applications in regenerative medicine.
