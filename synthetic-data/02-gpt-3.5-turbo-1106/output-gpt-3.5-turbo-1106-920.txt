prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: Fcj1. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, the role of the Fcj1 protein complex in cellular respiration was investigated using a murine model of heart failure. It was found that the downregulation of Fcj1 correlated with the development of dilated cardiomyopathy in the mice, indicating a potential involvement of Fcj1 in the maintenance of mitochondrial structure and function. Furthermore, electron microscopy revealed alterations in mitochondrial morphology in Fcj1-deficient hearts, suggesting a link between Fcj1 and mitochondrial dynamics. Collectively, these findings highlight the importance of Fcj1 in mitochondrial integrity and provide insights into the pathogenesis of dilated cardiomyopathy. This research sheds light on the potential therapeutic targets for cardiac mitochondrial dysfunction in heart failure.
