prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: ESCRT3. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The endosomal sorting complex required for transport 3 (ESCRT3) complex has emerged as a critical player in the regulation of cell membrane dynamics and protein trafficking. Dysfunction of the ESCRT3 complex has been implicated in the pathogenesis of several diseases, including viral infections, neurodegenerative disorders, and cancer. Recent studies have revealed the pivotal role of ESCRT3 in the biogenesis and release of extracellular vesicles, shedding light on its potential as a therapeutic target in diverse pathological conditions. Furthermore, the intricate interplay between ESCRT3 and various molecular entities, such as ubiquitin-modified cargo proteins and lipid membranes, underscores the multifaceted functions of the complex in cellular homeostasis. Unraveling the molecular mechanisms underlying ESCRT3-mediated processes holds promise for the development of novel interventions to combat a wide range of human ailments.
