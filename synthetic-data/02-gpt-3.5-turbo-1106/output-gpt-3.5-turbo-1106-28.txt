prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: mitochondrial ribosomal small subunit. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: Our study investigated the role of the mitochondrial ribosomal small subunit in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease. By using a transgenic mouse model overexpressing mutant alpha-synuclein, we observed a significant reduction in the expression and activity of the mitochondrial ribosomal small subunit, leading to mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress. Furthermore, transcriptomic analysis revealed dysregulation of key mitochondrial genes associated with energy metabolism and oxidative phosphorylation. Interestingly, treatment with a mitochondrial-targeted antioxidant restored the expression and activity of the mitochondrial ribosomal small subunit, and mitigated neurodegeneration and motor deficits in the mouse model. These findings highlight the potential therapeutic significance of preserving the function of the mitochondrial ribosomal small subunit in Parkinson's disease.
