prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: polysome. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we investigate the impact of Ribavirin, a known antiviral agent, on the translation process in mammalian cellular systems through its interaction with the polysome complex. Our results demonstrate that treatment with Ribavirin leads to a significant decrease in the association of specific mRNAs with polysomes, indicating a potential disruption of protein synthesis. Furthermore, we observed that Ribavirin treatment affects the cellular response to viral infection, implicating the polysome complex in the modulation of antiviral pathways. These findings provide insights into the role of polysomes in the cellular response to antiviral agents and highlight the potential of targeting polysome function for the development of therapeutic interventions against viral diseases.
