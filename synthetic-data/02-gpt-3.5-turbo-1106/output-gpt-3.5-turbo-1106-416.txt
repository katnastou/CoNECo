prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: laminin. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: Laminin is a major component of the extracellular matrix, playing a crucial role in maintaining tissue structural integrity and cell adhesion. Dysregulation of laminin has been implicated in various pathological conditions, including muscular dystrophy and kidney diseases. Recent studies have shown that the expression of laminin is tightly regulated by a complex interplay of signaling pathways involving growth factors and transcription factors. Furthermore, the interaction of laminin with other extracellular matrix proteins, such as collagen and fibronectin, has been linked to the progression of metastatic cancer. Understanding the molecular mechanisms governing laminin function and regulation holds promise for developing novel therapeutic strategies for a wide range of human diseases.
