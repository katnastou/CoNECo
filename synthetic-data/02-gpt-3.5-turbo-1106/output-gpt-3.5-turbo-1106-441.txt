prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: HIUH. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The HIUH protein complex has garnered significant attention in the field of metabolic research due to its role in purine metabolism. Recent studies have highlighted the central importance of the HIUH complex in the conversion of inosine monophosphate to xanthine, a critical step in the catabolism of purine nucleotides. Dysregulation of this pathway has been implicated in the pathogenesis of gout, a painful inflammatory arthritis resulting from the deposition of monosodium urate crystals in the joints. Additionally, disturbances in purine metabolism have been linked to the development of cardiovascular diseases and certain malignancies. Understanding the intricate regulatory mechanisms and functional implications of the HIUH complex may provide novel insights into therapeutic strategies targeting purine-related disorders.
