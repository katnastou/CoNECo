prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: BCKDHC. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: Our study investigated the role of the BCKDHC protein complex in the pathogenesis of maple syrup urine disease (MSUD), an inborn error of metabolism. Using a mouse model of the disease, we found that the absence of functional BCKDHC led to severe systemic metabolic imbalances, including elevated levels of branched-chain amino acids and ketoacids, as well as impaired neuronal function. Furthermore, we identified potential small molecule modulators that can interact with BCKDHC, offering promise for future therapeutic interventions for MSUD. This work highlights the critical importance of the BCKDHC protein complex in maintaining metabolic homeostasis and provides a framework for developing targeted treatments for MSUD.
