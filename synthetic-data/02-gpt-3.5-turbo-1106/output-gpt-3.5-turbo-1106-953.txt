prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: invertasome. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: A critical role for the protein complex known as invertasome has been uncovered in the pathogenesis of metabolic disorders. Recent studies have elucidated the involvement of invertasome in the regulation of lipid metabolism, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target for obesity and associated comorbidities. The interaction of invertasome with key cellular signaling pathways involved in lipid homeostasis sheds light on its influence on the development of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. Furthermore, the identification of small molecule inhibitors targeting invertasome activity presents a promising avenue for the development of novel therapeutic interventions for metabolic syndrome. These findings underscore the importance of investigating the molecular mechanisms underlying invertasome function in order to advance our understanding of metabolic disease and explore potential therapeutic strategies.
