prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: RecFOR. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: Recent studies have shed light on the role of the RecFOR protein complex in the repair of DNA damage in bacterial species. In particular, its involvement in the response to double-strand DNA breaks has been elucidated. The RecFOR complex is known to interact with the bacterial recombination mediator protein, RecA, leading to the formation of nucleoprotein filaments that facilitate the homologous recombination process. Furthermore, it has been demonstrated that the absence or dysfunction of RecFOR can lead to increased susceptibility to genotoxic stressors, such as ionizing radiation and certain antibiotics. This newfound understanding of the function of RecFOR offers potential avenues for the development of novel antimicrobial strategies targeting DNA repair mechanisms in bacterial pathogens.
