model: gpt-3.5-turbo-1106
prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: E-RTC. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we investigated the role of the E-RTC protein complex in the development of colorectal cancer. Utilizing a murine model, we observed a significant upregulation of E-RTC expression in tumor tissues compared to normal colon tissues. Furthermore, our findings revealed a positive correlation between E-RTC levels and the progression of adenoma to carcinoma in the colon. To explore potential therapeutic interventions, we assessed the effects of a novel small molecule inhibitor targeting E-RTC in vitro. Our results demonstrated a significant reduction in cell viability and proliferation of colorectal cancer cells following treatment with the E-RTC inhibitor. These findings highlight E-RTC as a potential therapeutic target for the management of colorectal cancer and warrant further investigation into its underlying molecular mechanisms.
