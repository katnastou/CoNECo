prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: PA700-dependent proteasome activator. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The PA700-dependent proteasome activator plays a crucial role in regulating protein degradation pathways, influencing the development and progression of various human diseases. Recent studies have implicated dysregulation of the PA700-dependent proteasome activator in neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease. Furthermore, aberrant activity of the PA700-dependent proteasome activator has been associated with the progression of certain types of cancer. Given the central role of the PA700-dependent proteasome activator in maintaining protein homeostasis, a deeper understanding of its regulatory mechanisms and interactions with other cellular components is essential for the development of novel therapeutic interventions targeting these disease pathways.
