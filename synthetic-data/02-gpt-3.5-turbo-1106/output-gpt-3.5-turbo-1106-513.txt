prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: collagen type II trimer. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The collagen type II trimer is a critical component of the extracellular matrix in cartilage tissue. Studies have shown that mutations in the COL2A1 gene, which encodes the alpha-1 chain of collagen type II trimer, are associated with skeletal dysplasias such as spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia congenita and Kniest dysplasia. Additionally, abnormal deposition of collagen type II trimer has been implicated in the pathogenesis of osteoarthritis, a common degenerative joint disease. Understanding the structural and functional properties of collagen type II trimer is essential for elucidating the molecular mechanisms underlying these skeletal disorders and for developing targeted therapeutic interventions.
