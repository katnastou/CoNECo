prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: HSC. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: Recent studies have revealed the crucial role of the Heat Shock Complex (HSC) in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's. HSC has been shown to interact with tau protein and Î±-synuclein, two hallmark proteins implicated in the pathogenesis of these diseases. It has been proposed that the dysregulation of HSC function may contribute to the accumulation and misfolding of these proteins, leading to the formation of toxic aggregates. Furthermore, small molecule modulators of HSC activity have demonstrated promising therapeutic potential in preclinical models, suggesting that targeting the HSC complex may represent a novel approach for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases. These findings highlight the significance of HSC in the development and progression of neurodegenerative disorders and provide a potential new avenue for therapeutic intervention.
