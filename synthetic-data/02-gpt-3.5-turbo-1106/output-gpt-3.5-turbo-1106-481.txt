prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: exodeoxyribonuclease VII. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we investigated the potential role of exodeoxyribonuclease VII in the pathogenesis of colorectal cancer. Our findings suggest that elevated levels of exodeoxyribonuclease VII in tumor tissues are associated with a more aggressive phenotype and poorer prognosis in colorectal cancer patients. Furthermore, our in vitro experiments demonstrated that inhibition of exodeoxyribonuclease VII activity resulted in decreased proliferation and increased apoptosis of colorectal cancer cells. These results provide valuable insights into the potential therapeutic targeting of exodeoxyribonuclease VII as a novel strategy for the treatment of colorectal cancer. This study sheds light on the intricate molecular mechanisms underlying colorectal cancer progression and highlights exodeoxyribonuclease VII as a promising molecular target for future therapeutic interventions.
