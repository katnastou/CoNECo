model: gpt-3.5-turbo-1106
prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: gammaTuSC. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The gammaTuSC complex, critical for microtubule nucleation and organization, interacts with various cellular factors to regulate cytoskeletal dynamics. Recent studies have illustrated its role in promoting cell division and maintaining proper spindle formation during mitosis. Dysregulation of the gammaTuSC complex has been linked to the pathogenesis of certain neurodevelopmental disorders and cancers. Further investigation into the molecular mechanisms governing the assembly and function of this complex will not only advance our understanding of fundamental cellular processes but also offer new insights for the development of targeted therapies in diseases associated with microtubule dysfunction.
