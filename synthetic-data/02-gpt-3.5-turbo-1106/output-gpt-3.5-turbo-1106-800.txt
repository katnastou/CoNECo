prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: OSTCIII. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The assembly of the OSTCIII protein complex plays a crucial role in the process of N-glycosylation within the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). In this study, we investigate the impact of chemical chaperones on the stability and functionality of the OSTCIII complex in the context of Gaucher disease, a lysosomal storage disorder characterized by defective glucosylceramide metabolism. Using a mouse model of Gaucher disease, we demonstrate that the administration of chemical chaperones significantly enhances the ER folding capacity, leading to improved assembly and activity of the OSTCIII complex. Our findings shed light on the potential therapeutic implications of targeting protein folding pathways to ameliorate N-glycosylation defects associated with lysosomal storage disorders.
