prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: outer dynein arm. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The outer dynein arm protein complex is a critical component of motile cilia and flagella in eukaryotic organisms. This complex plays a pivotal role in ciliary and flagellar movement, contributing to the generation of directed fluid flow and enabling cellular motility. Dysfunction or deficiency of the outer dynein arm has been associated with primary ciliary dyskinesia, a genetically heterogeneous disorder characterized by impaired ciliary movement and recurrent respiratory infections. Experimental studies have investigated the molecular composition and organization of the outer dynein arm, as well as the regulatory mechanisms underlying its assembly and function. Insights into the structure-function relationships of this complex are essential for understanding its role in health and disease and may contribute to the development of targeted therapeutic strategies for primary ciliary dyskinesia.
