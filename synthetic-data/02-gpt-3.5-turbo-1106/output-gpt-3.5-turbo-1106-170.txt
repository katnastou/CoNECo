prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: RDC. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The RDC protein complex has garnered attention for its critical role in cellular homeostasis and disease pathogenesis. Recent studies have elucidated the complex's involvement in modulating inflammatory responses, with implications for conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis and inflammatory bowel disease. Furthermore, the interaction between RDC and specific chemical entities has been shown to regulate important signaling pathways, shedding light on potential therapeutic targets for intervention. Additionally, investigations into the effects of RDC dysregulation in various model organisms have provided valuable insights into the complex interplay between molecular entities and disease progression. Further exploration of the molecular mechanisms underlying the function and regulation of the RDC protein complex promises to advance our understanding of cellular processes and disease pathophysiology.
