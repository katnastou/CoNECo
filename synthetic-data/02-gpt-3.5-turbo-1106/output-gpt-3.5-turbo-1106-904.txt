prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: retromer CSC. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The retromer CSC has been implicated in the pathogenesis of various neurodegenerative disorders, including Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease. Dysregulation of retromer CSC function has been observed in cellular and animal models of these conditions. Research efforts have focused on elucidating the underlying mechanisms of retromer CSC dysfunction and its potential contribution to disease progression. Furthermore, small molecule modulators targeting retromer CSC have shown promise in preclinical studies for ameliorating disease-related phenotypes, providing a potential avenue for future therapeutic interventions. It is imperative to further investigate the role of retromer CSC in neurodegenerative diseases in order to elucidate its potential as a therapeutic target.
