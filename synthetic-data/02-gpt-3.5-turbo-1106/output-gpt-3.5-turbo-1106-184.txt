prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: GARP. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In recent years, the GARP protein complex has emerged as a critical regulator of immune homeostasis and inflammation. Studies have shown that GARP plays a pivotal role in the activation and regulation of TGF-Î² signaling, impacting key cellular processes such as immune cell differentiation, tissue repair, and immunosuppression. Dysregulation of GARP expression has been implicated in various pathological conditions, including cancer, autoimmune diseases, and chronic inflammation. Understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying GARP function and its potential as a therapeutic target is of utmost importance for advancing our knowledge of immune modulation and the development of novel treatment strategies for immune-related disorders.
