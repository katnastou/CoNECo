prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: cap(0)-RTC. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The cap(0)-RTC complex plays a crucial role in the regulation of mRNA capping and transcription. Previous studies have implicated its involvement in the maintenance of proper mRNA stability and export. Here, we present evidence supporting the interaction of cap(0)-RTC with the small molecule inhibitor X-37, resulting in a significant reduction in cap(0) levels within the cell. Furthermore, our findings indicate a potential link between cap(0)-RTC inhibition and the onset of neuronal degeneration, suggesting a novel avenue for targeted therapeutic intervention in neurodegenerative diseases. This study sheds light on the complex interplay between cap(0)-RTC and small molecule modulators, with implications for the treatment of neurological disorders.
