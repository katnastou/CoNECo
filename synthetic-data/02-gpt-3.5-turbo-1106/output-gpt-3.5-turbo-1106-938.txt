prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: GIM. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The GIM protein complex is a crucial regulator of cellular homeostasis and has been implicated in various human diseases. In this study, we investigated the role of the GIM complex in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease. Our results demonstrate that the GIM complex is dysregulated in the brains of Alzheimer's patients, leading to aberrant amyloid beta accumulation and neuroinflammation. Furthermore, we identified a small molecule inhibitor that effectively disrupts the assembly of the GIM complex and attenuates disease progression in a mouse model of Alzheimer's. These findings highlight the potential of targeting the GIM complex as a therapeutic strategy for Alzheimer's disease and provide insight into its broader implications in neurodegenerative disorders.
