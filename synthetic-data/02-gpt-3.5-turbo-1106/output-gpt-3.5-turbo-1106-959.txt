prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: RZZ. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The RZZ protein complex plays a critical role in ensuring accurate chromosome segregation during mitosis. Recent studies have revealed the involvement of RZZ in the maintenance of genomic stability and prevention of aneuploidy, which are associated with various human diseases, including cancer and developmental disorders. The interaction of RZZ with kinetochore proteins and motor proteins facilitates the attachment and movement of chromosomes along the mitotic spindle. Dysregulation of RZZ has been implicated in the pathogenesis of diseases such as breast cancer and neurodevelopmental disorders. Understanding the precise mechanism of action and regulation of the RZZ protein complex holds promise for the development of targeted therapeutic strategies for these diseases.
