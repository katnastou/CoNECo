prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: Abetal. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we investigated the role of the Abetal protein complex in the development of neurodegenerative disorders. Our findings show that the upregulation of Abetal in neuronal cells is associated with increased oxidative stress and impaired protein folding, leading to the accumulation of misfolded proteins and subsequent neuronal dysfunction. Furthermore, we observed a direct interaction between Abetal and amyloid beta, a hallmark protein in Alzheimer's disease, suggesting a potential involvement of the Abetal complex in the pathogenesis of this neurodegenerative disorder. These results highlight the importance of understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying Abetal function in the context of neurodegenerative diseases, providing potential targets for therapeutic interventions.
