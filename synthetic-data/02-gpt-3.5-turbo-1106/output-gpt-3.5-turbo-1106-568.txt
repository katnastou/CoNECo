prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: mitochondrial 28S ribosomal subunit. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In recent studies, the expression and function of the mitochondrial 28S ribosomal subunit have been investigated in the context of Parkinson's disease. It has been observed that the mitochondrial 28S ribosomal subunit plays a crucial role in the maintenance of mitochondrial protein synthesis, which is essential for the proper functioning of the electron transport chain and ATP production. Dysfunction of this subunit has been implicated in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease, leading to mitochondrial protein imbalance and impaired energy production. Furthermore, the dysregulation of mitochondrial 28S ribosomal subunit expression has been associated with increased oxidative stress and neuronal cell death, suggesting a potential involvement in the progression of Parkinson's disease. These findings highlight the importance of further research into the role of the mitochondrial 28S ribosomal subunit in neurodegenerative diseases and its potential as a therapeutic target.
