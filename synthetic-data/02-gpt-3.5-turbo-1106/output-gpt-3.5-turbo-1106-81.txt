prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: DOM-A. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we investigated the role of the DOM-A protein complex in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease. Through a comprehensive analysis of postmortem brain tissue from Alzheimer's disease patients and age-matched control subjects, we demonstrated a significant upregulation of DOM-A expression in affected brain regions. Furthermore, our findings revealed a strong correlation between DOM-A levels and the severity of neurofibrillary tangles, a hallmark pathology of Alzheimer's disease. Using a combination of in vitro and in vivo models, we delineated the molecular pathways through which DOM-A contributes to neuronal degeneration and cognitive decline. Our results highlight the potential of targeting DOM-A as a therapeutic strategy for mitigating the progression of Alzheimer's disease.
