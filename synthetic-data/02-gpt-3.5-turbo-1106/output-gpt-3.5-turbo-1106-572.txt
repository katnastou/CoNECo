prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: Pex14. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we aimed to investigate the role of the Pex14 protein complex in peroxisome biogenesis in patients with Zellweger syndrome. We utilized a combination of in vitro and in vivo experiments to elucidate the interaction between Pex14 and peroxisomal membrane proteins in patients with the disease. Immunofluorescence staining and co-immunoprecipitation assays revealed a direct association between Pex14 and specific peroxisomal membrane proteins in affected individuals. Furthermore, quantitative analysis of peroxisome number and morphology in patient fibroblasts demonstrated a significant impairment in peroxisome biogenesis and maintenance, suggesting the critical involvement of the Pex14 protein complex in the pathogenesis of Zellweger syndrome. These findings provide valuable insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying peroxisome dysfunction in this rare and devastating disorder, highlighting the potential of targeting the Pex14 complex as a therapeutic strategy for Zellweger syndrome patients.
