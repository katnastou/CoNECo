prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: scADA. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we sought to investigate the potential role of scADA in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative disorders. We conducted experiments using a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease, as well as post-mortem brain tissue analysis from Alzheimer's patients. Our results revealed a significant upregulation of scADA in the brains of diseased mice and human patients, compared to healthy controls. Furthermore, pharmacological inhibition of scADA using a specific small molecule inhibitor led to a reduction in neuroinflammation and amyloid-beta plaque deposition in the mouse model. These findings suggest that targeting scADA may hold promise as a therapeutic strategy for slowing the progression of Alzheimer's disease and related neurodegenerative conditions.
