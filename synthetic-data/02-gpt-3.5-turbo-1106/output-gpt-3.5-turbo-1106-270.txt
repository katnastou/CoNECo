prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: IHF. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we investigated the role of the Integration Host Factor (IHF) protein complex in the regulation of gene expression in Escherichia coli. We analyzed the binding of IHF to the promoter regions of various genes involved in the pathogenesis of Salmonella enterica infection. Our results demonstrate that IHF plays a critical role in modulating the expression of virulence factors, such as hydrolytic enzymes and adhesins, contributing to the pathogenicity of Salmonella enterica. Furthermore, we observed that IHF binding is influenced by the presence of specific environmental cues, suggesting a potential regulatory mechanism for the adaptation of Salmonella enterica to different host niches. These findings provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying the interaction between IHF and bacterial pathogenesis, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target for controlling Salmonella enterica infections.
