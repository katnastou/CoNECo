prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: AMY1. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The AMY1 protein complex plays a crucial role in the molecular mechanism of carbohydrate metabolism, particularly in the hydrolysis of starch into maltose and glucose. Variations in AMY1 gene copy number have been associated with differences in salivary amylase levels among human populations, suggesting a potential link to dietary adaptations and metabolic diseases such as obesity and type 2 diabetes. Recent studies have also indicated a possible involvement of AMY1 in the microbial composition of the oral microbiome, highlighting its potential impact on oral health and microbial ecology. Understanding the functional significance and regulatory pathways of the AMY1 protein complex may offer valuable insights into personalized nutrition and disease prevention strategies.
