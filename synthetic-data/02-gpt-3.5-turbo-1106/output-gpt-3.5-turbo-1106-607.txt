prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: photosystem II. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: Photosystem II (PSII) is a key component of the photosynthetic machinery in plants and algae, playing a critical role in the conversion of light energy into chemical energy. PSII is a large multiprotein complex containing multiple cofactors, including chlorophyll, carotenoids, and the manganese-containing oxygen-evolving complex. The activity of PSII is essential for the production of oxygen and the generation of reducing equivalents for carbon fixation. Dysfunction of PSII has been implicated in various environmental stress conditions, such as high light intensity, drought, and extreme temperatures. Understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying the function of PSII is crucial for addressing global challenges related to food security and climate change.
