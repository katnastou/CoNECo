prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: DPM synthase. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In recent years, there has been growing interest in understanding the biochemical properties and functional significance of the DPM synthase protein complex. DPM synthase is involved in the biosynthesis of dolichol phosphate mannose, a critical step in the production of glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchors that attach proteins to the cell membrane. Abnormalities in the DPM synthase complex have been associated with congenital disorders of glycosylation, leading to a better elucidation of the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying these conditions. Additionally, small molecule inhibitors targeting DPM synthase have been explored for their potential therapeutic implications in diseases characterized by aberrant glycosylation patterns. Further investigation into the regulation and structural features of the DPM synthase complex could yield important insights into its role in health and disease.
