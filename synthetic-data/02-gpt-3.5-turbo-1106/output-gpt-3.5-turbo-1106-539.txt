prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: PDGF. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: Platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) is a key signaling molecule involved in various biological processes, including cell growth, proliferation, and migration. Dysregulation of PDGF signaling has been linked to several pathological conditions, such as fibrotic diseases and certain cancers. In the context of fibrotic diseases, overactivation of the PDGF pathway has been associated with excessive deposition of extracellular matrix proteins, leading to tissue scarring and impaired organ function. Consequently, PDGF and its downstream effectors have emerged as potential therapeutic targets for the management of fibrotic disorders. However, the complexity of the PDGF signaling network necessitates further investigation to elucidate its precise role in disease pathogenesis and identify novel strategies for intervention.
