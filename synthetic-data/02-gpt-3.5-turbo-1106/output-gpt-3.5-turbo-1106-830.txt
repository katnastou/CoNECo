prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: PMM-2. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The PMM-2 protein complex has been the subject of great interest in the study of congenital disorders of glycosylation (CDG), a group of rare metabolic disorders characterized by impaired protein glycosylation. Mutations in the gene encoding PMM-2 have been associated with CDG type Ia, which is characterized by a wide range of clinical manifestations, including developmental delay, intellectual disability, and variable multi-organ involvement. Several studies have investigated the impact of PMM-2 mutations on protein glycosylation patterns, highlighting the crucial role of this complex in maintaining proper glycosylation. Furthermore, therapeutic interventions targeting the PMM-2 complex have shown promising results in preclinical models, offering potential new avenues for the management of CDG type Ia. Ongoing research efforts aim to further elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying PMM-2 dysfunction and to explore novel treatment strategies for this debilitating disorder.
