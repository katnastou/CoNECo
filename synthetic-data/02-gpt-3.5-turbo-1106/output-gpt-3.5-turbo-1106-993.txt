prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: IL-12. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The IL-12 protein complex plays a crucial role in regulating immune responses and has been implicated in a variety of infectious and autoimmune diseases. Previous studies have shown that IL-12 is able to induce the production of interferon-gamma and enhance the cytotoxic activity of natural killer cells and T cells, thereby promoting host defense against microbial pathogens. In addition, dysregulation of IL-12 signaling has been associated with the pathogenesis of conditions such as inflammatory bowel disease, multiple sclerosis, and certain types of cancer. Given the multifaceted functions of IL-12, understanding its biochemistry and physiological roles may yield valuable insights for the development of novel immunotherapies and pharmacological interventions for a broad range of human diseases.
