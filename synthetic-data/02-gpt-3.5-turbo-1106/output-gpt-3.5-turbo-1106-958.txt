prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: Nic96. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In our study, we investigated the role of the Nic96 protein complex in the regulation of nuclear pore complex (NPC) functions. We utilized budding yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) as a model organism to analyze the effects of Nic96 depletion on nuclear transport and RNA metabolism. Our findings demonstrate that Nic96 plays a crucial role in maintaining the integrity and functionality of the NPC. Furthermore, we observed aberrant nuclear-cytoplasmic shuttling of key macromolecules, including mRNA and protein cargoes, upon Nic96 disruption. Notably, our results suggest a potential link between Nic96 dysfunction and the onset of certain neurodegenerative disorders characterized by impaired nucleocytoplasmic transport. Overall, our study sheds light on the importance of the Nic96 protein complex in maintaining cellular homeostasis and its implication in the pathogenesis of certain diseases.
