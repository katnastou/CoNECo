prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: IL-5 receptor. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The IL-5 receptor, a key mediator of eosinophil activation and recruitment, has been implicated in the pathogenesis of eosinophilic asthma, a debilitating condition characterized by severe airway inflammation and remodeling. Recent studies have investigated the potential of small molecule inhibitors targeting IL-5 receptor signaling as a therapeutic strategy for mitigating eosinophilic inflammation in the airways. In a murine model of allergen-induced asthma, treatment with a novel IL-5 receptor inhibitor resulted in a significant reduction in eosinophil infiltration into the lungs, accompanied by a decrease in airway hyperresponsiveness. These findings underscore the potential of targeting the IL-5 receptor as a promising avenue for the development of new treatments for eosinophilic asthma.
