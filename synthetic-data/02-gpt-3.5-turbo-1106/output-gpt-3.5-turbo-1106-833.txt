prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: 5HT3 receptor. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The 5HT3 receptor is a ligand-gated ion channel that plays a crucial role in regulating neurotransmission within the central and peripheral nervous systems. Activation of the 5HT3 receptor by its endogenous ligand, serotonin, has been implicated in the pathophysiology of several psychiatric disorders, including anxiety and depression. Furthermore, modulation of the 5HT3 receptor has been explored as a potential therapeutic target for the management of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting. Recent studies have also suggested that certain chemical compounds, such as ondansetron and granisetron, act as selective antagonists of the 5HT3 receptor, offering promising avenues for pharmaceutical intervention. These findings highlight the potential clinical significance of targeting the 5HT3 receptor in the treatment of various neurological and psychiatric conditions.
