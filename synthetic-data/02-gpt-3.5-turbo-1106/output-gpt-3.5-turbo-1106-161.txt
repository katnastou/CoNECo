prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: T3SS. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: Recent advances in understanding the pathogenesis of bacterial infections have elucidated the key role of the type III secretion system (T3SS) in the virulence of numerous Gram-negative pathogens. The T3SS is a needle-like protein complex that spans the bacterial inner and outer membranes, facilitating the direct injection of effector proteins into host cells. This sophisticated machinery enables the manipulation of host cell signaling pathways, leading to cellular disruption and evasion of immune responses. Targeting the T3SS has emerged as a promising strategy for developing novel antimicrobial agents to combat infections caused by bacteria such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Yersinia pestis, and Salmonella enterica. Understanding the interactions between T3SS and host cells is crucial for the development of effective therapeutics to combat such infectious diseases.
