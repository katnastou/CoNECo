prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: YdcSTUV ABC transporter. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we investigated the role of the YdcSTUV ABC transporter in the transport of various substrates across the cytoplasmic membrane of the model bacterium Escherichia coli. The YdcSTUV complex is known for its involvement in the transportation of diverse compounds, including antibiotics, ions, and sugars. Our findings demonstrate that the YdcSTUV ABC transporter is crucial for the uptake of essential nutrients and the efflux of toxic compounds in E. coli. Furthermore, we observed that mutations in the YdcSTUV transporter led to impaired growth and increased susceptibility to antimicrobial agents. Our results provide valuable insights into the physiological significance of the YdcSTUV complex and lay the foundation for further investigations of its potential as a target for antimicrobial therapy.
