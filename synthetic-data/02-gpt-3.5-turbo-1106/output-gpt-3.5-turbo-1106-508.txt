prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: SNARE. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The SNARE protein complex plays a crucial role in intracellular membrane fusion, a fundamental process required for neurotransmission. Dysregulation of the SNARE complex has been implicated in various neurological disorders, including Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease. Recent studies have demonstrated the potential therapeutic relevance of targeting the SNARE complex for the treatment of these conditions. Given the central role of the SNARE complex in synaptic function, further investigation into its molecular mechanisms and potential as a therapeutic target is warranted. The elucidation of the intricate interplay between the SNARE complex and other key players in neurotransmission may offer valuable insights into the pathophysiology of neurological disorders and facilitate the development of novel therapeutic strategies.
