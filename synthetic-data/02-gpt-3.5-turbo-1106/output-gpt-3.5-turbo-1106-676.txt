prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: BBSome. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The BBSome protein complex has been implicated in the pathogenesis of Bardet-Biedl syndrome, a rare genetic disorder characterized by obesity, retinal degeneration, and renal abnormalities. Recent studies have identified a direct interaction between the BBSome and the small GTPase Rab8, which plays a crucial role in the regulation of ciliary membrane trafficking. Furthermore, dysregulation of the BBSome has been linked to ciliopathies, highlighting its importance in maintaining ciliary function. Further exploration of the mechanisms underlying the BBSome-Rab8 interaction may yield valuable insights into the pathophysiology of Bardet-Biedl syndrome and other ciliopathies, providing potential targets for therapeutic intervention.
