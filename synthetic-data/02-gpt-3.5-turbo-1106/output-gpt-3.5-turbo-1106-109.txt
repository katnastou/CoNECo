prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: 5HT3A-R. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: Activation of the 5HT3A-R protein complex has been implicated in the modulation of neurotransmitter signaling and regulation of gastrointestinal function. Recent studies have demonstrated that serotonin, an endogenous ligand, directly interacts with the 5HT3A-R to induce excitatory responses in the central and peripheral nervous systems. Furthermore, aberrant signaling through the 5HT3A-R has been associated with nausea, chemotherapy-induced vomiting, and irritable bowel syndrome. Pharmacological agents targeting the 5HT3A-R have shown promise in alleviating symptoms associated with these conditions, highlighting the potential therapeutic role of 5HT3A-R modulation in the management of gastrointestinal disorders. These findings underscore the significance of the 5HT3A-R in both physiological and pathological processes, suggesting its potential as a clinical target for the development of novel therapeutic interventions.
