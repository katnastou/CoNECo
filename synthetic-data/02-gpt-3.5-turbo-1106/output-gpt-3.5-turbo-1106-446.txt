prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: AP-2 adaptor. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we investigated the role of the AP-2 adaptor complex in the endocytic pathway of mammalian cells. Our findings demonstrate that the expression levels of AP-2 adaptors are crucial for regulating the internalization and trafficking of membrane-associated cargo proteins, such as transferrin and epidermal growth factor receptors. Moreover, our data reveal that the AP-2 adaptor complex is essential for the selective sorting of specific transmembrane proteins into clathrin-coated vesicles, thereby influencing the intracellular distribution and degradation of these cargo proteins. Importantly, our results highlight the potential relevance of AP-2 adaptors in the pathogenesis of certain human diseases characterized by dysregulated endocytic processes, including neurodegenerative disorders and certain types of cancer. These findings shed light on the intricate mechanisms governing cellular internalization and underscore the significance of the AP-2 adaptor complex in maintaining cellular homeostasis and proper functioning.
