prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: CAF-1. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we investigated the role of the CAF-1 protein complex in the progression of colorectal cancer. Using molecular analyses, we observed an upregulation of CAF-1 expression in tumor tissues compared to adjacent normal mucosa. Further functional assays revealed that CAF-1 interacts with key regulatory elements of cell cycle progression, potentially contributing to enhanced cell proliferation and tumorigenesis. Additionally, we identified a positive correlation between CAF-1 levels and the expression of certain oncogenes implicated in colorectal carcinogenesis. These findings provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying colorectal cancer progression and highlight the potential of targeting CAF-1 as a therapeutic strategy for this disease.
