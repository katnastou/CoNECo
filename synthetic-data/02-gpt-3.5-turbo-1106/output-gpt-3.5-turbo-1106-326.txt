prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: GGR. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: Recent studies have implicated the GGR protein complex in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease. The GGR complex has been shown to interact with various cellular components, such as amyloid beta peptides and tau protein, both of which are key players in the development of Alzheimer's disease. Furthermore, the upregulation of GGR activity has been correlated with increased levels of oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction in neuronal cells, highlighting its potential role in disease progression. These findings underscore the importance of further investigating the molecular mechanisms underlying GGR-mediated pathology and its potential as a therapeutic target for neurodegenerative diseases.
