prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: HCN3 channel. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In recent years, the role of the HCN3 channel in cardiovascular pathophysiology has garnered increasing attention. HCN3 channels are members of the hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated (HCN) channel family, and their unique properties make them pivotal players in the regulation of heart rate and cardiac rhythm. Studies have implicated HCN3 channels in the pathogenesis of various cardiac arrhythmias, including atrial fibrillation and ventricular tachycardia. Additionally, recent investigations have shed light on the potential therapeutic targeting of HCN3 channels for the management of arrhythmias and heart failure. The intricate interplay between HCN3 channels and other ion channels, signaling molecules, and regulatory pathways presents a complex yet promising avenue for future research and clinical intervention. Understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying the function and dysregulation of HCN3 channels is critical for developing novel strategies to modulate cardiac electrophysiology and ameliorate arrhythmogenic disorders.
