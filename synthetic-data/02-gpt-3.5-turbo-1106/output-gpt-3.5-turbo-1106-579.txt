prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: surface IgG2. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we investigated the role of surface IgG2 in the immune response to Streptococcus pneumoniae infection in a murine model. We found that mice deficient in surface IgG2 exhibited increased susceptibility to pneumococcal infection, with higher bacterial loads in the lungs and blood compared to wild-type controls. Additionally, we observed a significant decrease in the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines in the absence of surface IgG2, indicating its crucial role in mounting an effective immune response against S. pneumoniae. Furthermore, analysis of serum samples revealed a reduced level of opsonizing antibodies in the absence of surface IgG2, highlighting its importance in the clearance of bacterial pathogens. These findings suggest that surface IgG2 plays a critical role in the host defense against pneumococcal infection and could serve as a potential target for the development of novel therapeutic interventions.
