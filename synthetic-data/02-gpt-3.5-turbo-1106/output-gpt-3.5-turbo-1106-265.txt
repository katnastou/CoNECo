prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: NAC. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The NAC protein complex has been implicated in various cellular processes, including protein folding and degradation, stress response, and development. Recent studies have shown that the NAC complex interacts with several chaperone proteins, such as HSP70 and HSP90, to modulate protein homeostasis under conditions of cellular stress. Additionally, dysregulation of the NAC complex has been linked to neurodegenerative diseases, such as Parkinson's and Alzheimer's, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target for these disorders. Further investigation into the role of the NAC complex in cellular homeostasis and disease pathogenesis is warranted to elucidate its potential as a therapeutic target for neurodegenerative diseases.
