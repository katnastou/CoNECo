prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: MECO. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: Recent studies have highlighted the significance of the MECO protein complex in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative disorders, particularly in Alzheimer's disease. The MECO complex plays a crucial role in the regulation of cellular processes implicated in the accumulation of amyloid-beta plaques and neurofibrillary tangles, which are hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease. Additionally, dysregulation of the MECO complex has been implicated in the perturbation of synaptic function and neuronal survival, further underscoring its relevance in neurodegenerative conditions. The identification of potential MECO modulators holds promise for the development of novel therapeutic strategies aimed at mitigating the progression of Alzheimer's disease and related neurodegenerative disorders. Further investigations into the molecular mechanisms governing MECO complex function may provide valuable insights into the development of targeted interventions for these devastating conditions.
