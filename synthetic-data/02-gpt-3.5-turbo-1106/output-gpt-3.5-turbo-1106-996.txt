prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: IDH. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) complex plays a crucial role in cellular metabolism and has been implicated in various diseases, including glioblastoma and acute myeloid leukemia. Mutations in the IDH complex have been associated with altered metabolic pathways, leading to the accumulation of oncometabolites such as 2-hydroxyglutarate. Recent studies have highlighted the potential of targeting the IDH complex as a therapeutic strategy for these diseases. Furthermore, the dysregulation of the IDH complex has been linked to aberrant DNA methylation patterns, providing insights into its role in epigenetic regulation. Understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying the function of the IDH complex may provide novel avenues for the development of targeted therapies for diseases associated with its dysregulation.
