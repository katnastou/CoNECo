prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: NTC. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The NTC protein complex has been the focus of extensive research due to its pivotal role in splicing and mRNA processing. This complex has been implicated in various human diseases, including spinal muscular atrophy and retinitis pigmentosa, highlighting its importance in maintaining cellular homeostasis. Recent studies have identified a potential small molecule inhibitor that selectively targets the NTC complex, offering promise for therapeutic intervention in diseases associated with aberrant splicing events. Further investigation into the molecular mechanisms of NTC complex inhibition holds significant potential for the development of novel therapeutics targeting splicing-related disorders.
