prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: FtsEX. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The role of the FtsEX protein complex in the division apparatus of bacterial cells has garnered significant attention in recent years. This integral membrane complex, composed of the FtsE and FtsX subunits, plays a crucial role in cell division and peptidoglycan synthesis in various Gram-negative bacterial species. Recent research has highlighted the importance of FtsEX in the maintenance of cell shape and integrity, and its potential as a target for the development of novel antimicrobial agents. Furthermore, studies have shown that mutations in the FtsEX complex can lead to aberrant cell division and impaired cell viability, highlighting the essential nature of this complex in bacterial physiology. Understanding the molecular mechanisms and interactions associated with FtsEX holds promise for the development of new therapeutic strategies against bacterial infections.
