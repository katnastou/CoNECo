prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: CTDK-I. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: This study aimed to investigate the potential role of CTDK-I in the development of hepatocellular carcinoma. Using a murine model, we observed a significant upregulation of CTDK-I expression in liver tissues with tumor formation compared to healthy controls. Additionally, inhibition of CTDK-I activity with a small-molecule inhibitor led to a reduction in tumor growth and metastasis in vivo. Furthermore, analysis of patient samples revealed a positive correlation between CTDK-I levels and tumor stage, suggesting a potential clinical relevance of CTDK-I as a prognostic biomarker for hepatocellular carcinoma. These findings shed light on the potential of targeting CTDK-I as a therapeutic strategy for treating hepatocellular carcinoma.
