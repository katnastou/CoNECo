prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: IgG2. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we investigated the involvement of the IgG2 protein complex in the immune response to influenza infection in mice. Our findings revealed a significant upregulation of IgG2 levels in the serum of infected mice compared to uninfected controls. Furthermore, we observed a positive correlation between IgG2 levels and the severity of lung pathology, suggesting a potential role for IgG2 in the pathogenesis of influenza-induced lung injury. Treatment with a specific antibody targeting IgG2 resulted in a reduction in lung inflammation and improved survival outcomes, providing evidence for the therapeutic potential of targeting IgG2 in influenza-induced lung injury. Our results underscore the importance of understanding the dynamics of the IgG2 protein complex in the context of influenza infection and suggest that targeting IgG2 may represent a promising approach for the management of influenza-associated lung pathology.
