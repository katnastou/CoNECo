prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: mtEXO. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In recent years, the mitochondrial RNA exosome (mtEXO) complex has emerged as a crucial player in the regulation of mitochondrial gene expression. A study by Li et al. (2020) revealed that the mtEXO complex is highly conserved across eukaryotic organisms, suggesting its fundamental importance in mitochondrial RNA metabolism. Dysfunction of the mtEXO complex has been implicated in the pathogenesis of various mitochondrial diseases, including Leigh syndrome and mitochondrial myopathy. Moreover, the mtEXO complex has been shown to interact with several nuclear-encoded factors, such as PNPase and SUV3, further underscoring its intricate regulatory network. The elucidation of mtEXO complex function has significant implications for understanding mitochondrial disorders and may pave the way for the development of targeted therapeutic interventions.
