prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: PEP-A. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The PEP-A protein complex has been implicated in various cellular processes, including the regulation of cell proliferation and apoptosis. Previous studies have demonstrated the involvement of PEP-A in the pathogenesis of certain types of cancer, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target. In this study, we aimed to investigate the role of PEP-A in the context of inflammation-related diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis. Our results show a significant upregulation of PEP-A expression in synovial tissues from patients with rheumatoid arthritis compared to healthy controls. Furthermore, inhibition of PEP-A activity using a specific small molecule inhibitor attenuated the inflammatory response in an animal model of arthritis. These findings suggest that targeting PEP-A may hold promise as a novel therapeutic strategy for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis and other inflammatory conditions.
