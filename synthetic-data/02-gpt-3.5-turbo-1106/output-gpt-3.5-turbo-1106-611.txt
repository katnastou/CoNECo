prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: DNMT3A-3L. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we investigated the role of the DNMT3A-3L protein complex in the pathogenesis of acute myeloid leukemia (AML). We observed a significant upregulation of DNMT3A-3L expression in AML patient samples compared to healthy controls. Furthermore, we found that the aberrant expression of DNMT3A-3L correlated with a higher frequency of promoter hypermethylation of tumor suppressor genes in AML cells. In a mouse model of AML, inhibition of DNMT3A-3L activity using a specific small molecule inhibitor led to a decrease in leukemic cell proliferation and an increase in survival. Overall, our findings suggest that targeting the DNMT3A-3L protein complex may be a potential therapeutic strategy for AML.
