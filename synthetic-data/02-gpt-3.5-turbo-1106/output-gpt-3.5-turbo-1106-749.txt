prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: alpha1-beta1 integrin. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The alpha1-beta1 integrin protein complex is known to play a key role in cell adhesion and migration processes. Previous studies have shown its involvement in promoting tumor metastasis in various cancer types, including breast and lung cancers. In addition, the binding of fibronectin to alpha1-beta1 integrin has been implicated in the development and progression of fibrotic diseases, such as idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and liver cirrhosis. Furthermore, the interaction of the alpha1-beta1 integrin with collagen has been linked to the pathogenesis of certain musculoskeletal disorders, such as osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis. Given its diverse implications in various disease states, targeting the alpha1-beta1 integrin complex may hold potential for therapeutic interventions in cancer metastasis, fibrotic diseases, and musculoskeletal disorders.
