prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: IgA immunoglobulin. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: Recent studies have implicated the IgA immunoglobulin complex in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease, particularly in relation to the altered composition of the gut microbiota. Evidence suggests that dysregulation of IgA immunoglobulin may contribute to impaired mucosal immunity, leading to increased susceptibility to microbial invasion and chronic intestinal inflammation. Furthermore, alterations in the glycosylation patterns of IgA immunoglobulin have been linked to shifts in microbial diversity and the development of gut dysbiosis. These findings highlight the pivotal role of the IgA immunoglobulin complex in maintaining the delicate balance of the gut microbiome and provide a potential target for therapeutic intervention in the management of inflammatory bowel disease.
