prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: NAD(P)H dehydrogenase complex (plastoquinone). Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The NAD(P)H dehydrogenase complex (plastoquinone) plays a critical role in the photosynthetic electron transport chain in plants and green algae. This complex is essential for the conversion of NAD(P)H to NAD(P)+, thereby facilitating the transfer of electrons to plastoquinone. Dysfunction of the NAD(P)H dehydrogenase complex (plastoquinone) has been linked to disruptions in photosynthetic activity and impaired plant growth. Recent studies have highlighted the potential role of this complex in the response to oxidative stress and its implications in the development of plant diseases. Understanding the regulation and function of the NAD(P)H dehydrogenase complex (plastoquinone) is critical for elucidating the molecular mechanisms underlying photosynthesis and for developing strategies to enhance crop productivity and resilience to environmental stresses.
