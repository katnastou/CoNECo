prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: interleukin-20 receptor. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: Our study aimed to investigate the role of the interleukin-20 receptor in rheumatoid arthritis pathogenesis. Rheumatoid arthritis is a chronic autoimmune disease characterized by inflammation and joint destruction. The interleukin-20 receptor is involved in the signaling pathway of interleukin-20, which plays a critical role in the regulation of immune responses and inflammation. In this study, we utilized a murine model of rheumatoid arthritis to examine the effects of interleukin-20 receptor inhibition on disease progression. Our findings indicate that targeting the interleukin-20 receptor significantly attenuated joint inflammation and bone erosion, suggesting that this receptor may serve as a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis.
