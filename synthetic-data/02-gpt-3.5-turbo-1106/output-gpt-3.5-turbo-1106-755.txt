prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: BAP. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: Our study aimed to investigate the role of the BAP protein complex in the pathogenesis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Through bioinformatics analysis of publicly available gene expression datasets, we observed a significant upregulation of BAP in HCC tissues compared to normal liver tissues. Additionally, our in vitro experiments demonstrated that BAP inhibition could suppress the proliferation and migration of HCC cells. Furthermore, the expression of BAP was positively correlated with the tumor stage and overall survival of HCC patients. In conclusion, our findings suggest that the BAP protein complex may serve as a potential therapeutic target for HCC and warrant further investigation into its mechanisms of action in HCC progression.
