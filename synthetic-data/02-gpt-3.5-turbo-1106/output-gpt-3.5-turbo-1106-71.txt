prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: KFRC. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The role of the KFRC protein complex in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease has gained increasing attention in recent years. Previous studies have elucidated the interactions between KFRC and amyloid-beta oligomers, leading to the disruption of synaptic function and subsequent cognitive decline in Alzheimer's disease. Furthermore, the dysregulation of KFRC has been shown to modulate tau hyperphosphorylation, contributing to the formation of neurofibrillary tangles. In addition, the downregulation of KFRC has been associated with increased oxidative stress and neuroinflammation in Alzheimer's disease. These findings underscore the significance of KFRC as a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease. Further investigation into the mechanistic role of KFRC in the pathological cascade of Alzheimer's disease may provide valuable insights for the development of novel therapeutic strategies.
