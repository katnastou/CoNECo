prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: FACT. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The revolutionary protein complex FACT has been a key focus in recent studies investigating its critical role in modulating gene expression and maintaining genomic integrity. The complex, composed of two subunits, SPT16 and SSRP1, has shown to have a profound impact on the regulation of RNA polymerase II-mediated transcription and chromatin structure. This pivotal function has garnered significant attention in the context of various pathological conditions, particularly cancer, where dysregulation of FACT has been implicated in promoting tumor progression and therapeutic resistance. Elucidating the precise mechanistic underpinnings of FACT's involvement in disease pathogenesis is a crucial step in developing targeted therapies aimed at disrupting its aberrant activity. Furthermore, advancements in pharmacological targeting of FACT have shown promising results in preclinical models, offering hope for the development of novel therapeutics for malignancies associated with dysregulated FACT expression.
