prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: GATE-16. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we aimed to investigate the role of the GATE-16 protein complex in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease. We examined the expression levels of GATE-16 in post-mortem brain tissues from Parkinson's disease patients and healthy controls. Our findings revealed a significant upregulation of GATE-16 in the substantia nigra of Parkinson's disease patients compared to controls. Furthermore, we observed a positive correlation between GATE-16 levels and the severity of motor symptoms in Parkinson's disease. These results suggest that GATE-16 may play a crucial role in the development and progression of Parkinson's disease, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target for the management of this neurodegenerative disorder.
