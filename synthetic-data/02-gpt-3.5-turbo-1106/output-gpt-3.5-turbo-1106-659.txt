prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: MutSgamma. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In recent years, there has been growing interest in the role of the MutSgamma protein complex in the context of colorectal cancer development. MutSgamma has been found to play a critical role in maintaining genomic stability by recognizing and repairing DNA mismatches. Studies involving both human and mouse models have revealed a potential correlation between MutSgamma dysfunction and an increased predisposition to colorectal cancer. The accumulation of cytosine to thymine mutations in the presence of MutSgamma deficiency has been identified as a contributing factor to the tumorigenic transformation of colonic epithelial cells. Understanding the precise mechanisms underlying the involvement of MutSgamma in colorectal cancer pathogenesis holds promise for the development of targeted therapeutic interventions aimed at mitigating the impact of this debilitating disease.
