prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: kinesin II. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The role of the kinesin II protein complex in the pathogenesis of ciliopathies has been a subject of extensive investigation. Recent studies have implicated kinesin II in the regulation of ciliary transport and maintenance, highlighting its critical role in cellular homeostasis and disease development. Furthermore, the interaction of kinesin II with specific ciliary proteins and signaling pathways has emerged as a potential therapeutic target for ciliopathy-related disorders. Understanding the molecular pathways involving kinesin II may provide valuable insights for the development of novel treatment strategies aimed at mitigating the impact of ciliopathies on human health.
