prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: TRIKA1. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we investigated the potential impact of the small molecule inhibitor XZ-123 on the activity of the TRIKA1 protein complex in a mouse model of rheumatoid arthritis. Our results demonstrate that treatment with XZ-123 led to a significant reduction in joint inflammation and cartilage degradation compared to the control group. Furthermore, histological analysis revealed a decrease in the production of inflammatory cytokines in the synovial tissue of XZ-123-treated mice. These findings suggest that targeting the TRIKA1 protein complex with small molecule inhibitors may hold promise as a therapeutic strategy for mitigating the progression of rheumatoid arthritis and warrant further investigation in clinical settings.
