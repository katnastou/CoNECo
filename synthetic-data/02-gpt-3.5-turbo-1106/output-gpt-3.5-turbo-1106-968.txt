prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: ACF. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we investigated the role of the ACF protein complex in the regulation of gene expression in human lung cancer cells. We utilized small molecule inhibitors to modulate the activity of ACF and observed a significant reduction in the proliferation and invasion of lung cancer cells. Furthermore, RNA sequencing analysis revealed a distinct pattern of gene expression changes upon ACF inhibition, including the downregulation of several key genes associated with epithelial-mesenchymal transition and metastasis. Our findings suggest that targeting the ACF protein complex may hold promise for the development of novel therapies for lung cancer. These results provide valuable insights into the functional significance of ACF in cancer progression and highlight its potential as a therapeutic target for precision medicine approaches.
