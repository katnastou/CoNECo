prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: EGO. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The EGO protein complex, known for its role in regulating cellular growth and nutrient sensing, has been the subject of extensive research in the field of molecular biology. Recent studies have implicated EGO in the development of cancer, particularly in the context of nutrient starvation and metabolic stress. The complex interplay between EGO and its downstream effectors, such as mTOR and S6K, has opened new avenues for investigating potential therapeutic targets for cancer treatment. Furthermore, the EGO complex has been shown to interact with various cellular signaling pathways, including the PI3K/Akt pathway, highlighting its pivotal role in cell survival and proliferation. Understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying the function of the EGO complex may offer novel insights into the pathophysiology of cancer and inform the development of targeted therapies.
