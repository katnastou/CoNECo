prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: H3 HAT. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The histone acetyltransferase complex H3 HAT has been implicated in the regulation of chromatin structure and gene expression. Recent studies have suggested its potential role in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's disease, wherein aberrant acetylation of histone H3 has been linked to dysregulated gene transcription. Additionally, dysregulation of H3 HAT has been observed in certain cancer types, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target. Understanding the molecular mechanisms by which H3 HAT modulates gene expression and chromatin remodeling may provide insights into the development of novel therapeutic strategies for these complex diseases.
