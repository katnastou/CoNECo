prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: mitochondrial cytochrome bc(1). Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: A pivotal role of the mitochondrial cytochrome bc(1) complex has been well established in the pathogenesis of various diseases, including those associated with energy metabolism. Recent studies have indicated a potential link between alterations in the expression levels of this protein complex and the development of neurodegenerative disorders, such as Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease. Furthermore, the interaction of certain chemical agents with the mitochondrial cytochrome bc(1) complex has been implicated in drug-induced toxicities, emphasizing the importance of further investigating the molecular mechanisms underlying such interactions. These findings underscore the significance of targeted research efforts aimed at elucidating the functional implications of the mitochondrial cytochrome bc(1) complex in the context of disease development and therapeutic interventions.
