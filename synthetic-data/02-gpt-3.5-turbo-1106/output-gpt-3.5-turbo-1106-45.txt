prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: SRP. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The signal recognition particle (SRP) is a key component of the cellular protein targeting pathway and plays a crucial role in protein transport to the endoplasmic reticulum. Recently, studies have shown that mutations in the SRP gene are associated with a rare congenital disorder characterized by skeletal abnormalities and developmental delays. Furthermore, investigations into the involvement of SRP in cancer metastasis have revealed its potential as a therapeutic target for inhibiting tumor cell invasion and progression. Understanding the complex interplay between SRP and various disease states could provide valuable insights into the development of novel treatment strategies for a range of human pathologies.
