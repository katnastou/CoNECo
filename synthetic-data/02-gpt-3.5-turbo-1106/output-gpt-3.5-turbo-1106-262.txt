prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: MACIT. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The membrane attack complex inhibitory protein complex (MACIT) is a crucial component of the innate immune system, responsible for modulating the formation and function of the membrane attack complex (MAC) to prevent excessive host cell damage during complement activation. Studies have demonstrated the involvement of MACIT in the regulation of various inflammatory responses and autoimmune diseases, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target. Significant advances have been made towards elucidating the structural and functional properties of MACIT, providing insights into its potential interactions with small molecule inhibitors and its role in specific disease pathologies. Further investigation into the molecular mechanisms governing MACIT's activity is essential for the development of novel immunomodulatory therapies.
