prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: ABC lipid flippase MsbA. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we investigate the impact of ABC lipid flippase MsbA on cellular lipid homeostasis. We employed cell lines stably expressing wild-type and mutant forms of ABC lipid flippase MsbA to examine its role in the regulation of lipid transport and distribution. Our results demonstrate that the activity of ABC lipid flippase MsbA is crucial for maintaining proper lipid asymmetry across cellular membranes. Furthermore, we found that dysregulation of ABC lipid flippase MsbA function is associated with lipid metabolism disorders and cellular pathologies. These findings shed light on the pivotal role of ABC lipid flippase MsbA in maintaining lipid equilibrium and provide insights into potential therapeutic strategies for lipid-related diseases.
