prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: eif2B. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The regulation of protein synthesis is critical for cellular function, and dysregulation of the eukaryotic initiation factor 2B (eif2B) protein complex has been implicated in various pathologies, including neurodegenerative diseases and metabolic disorders. eif2B plays a crucial role in the initiation of translation by facilitating the exchange of guanine nucleotides on eukaryotic initiation factor 2 (eIF2), allowing it to participate in subsequent rounds of translation initiation. Dysfunctional eif2B has been associated with reduced protein synthesis and the activation of the integrated stress response, leading to impaired cellular homeostasis. Furthermore, eif2B dysfunction has been linked to the development of conditions such as vanishing white matter disease and cognitive impairment. Understanding the intricate regulatory mechanisms of eif2B could provide valuable insights into the pathophysiology of these disorders and potentially lead to targeted therapeutic interventions.
