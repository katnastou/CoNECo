prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: membrane-bound IgA. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: Membrane-bound IgA is a critical component of the mucosal immune system, playing a pivotal role in the defense against pathogens at mucosal surfaces. This protein complex, consisting of immunoglobulin A molecules anchored to the membranes of mucosal epithelial cells, serves as the primary antibody isotype in the mucosal immune system. Membrane-bound IgA is involved in the neutralization of microorganisms and toxins, as well as the regulation of the composition of the gut microbiota. Dysregulation of membrane-bound IgA expression has been implicated in the pathogenesis of various mucosal infections and inflammatory disorders, highlighting the importance of further research into the molecular mechanisms underlying its function.
