prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: CFIIm. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The study aimed to investigate the functional role of the CFIIm protein complex in the pathogenesis of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). A cohort of COPD patients and healthy controls were recruited for this investigation. The CFIIm complex was found to be significantly upregulated in the lung tissue of COPD patients compared to healthy controls, as confirmed by quantitative proteomic analysis. Furthermore, correlation analysis revealed a positive association between CFIIm expression levels and disease severity as measured by pulmonary function tests. In vitro experiments utilizing small molecule inhibitors targeting CFIIm demonstrated a significant reduction in inflammatory cytokine production in lung epithelial cells. These findings suggest a potential involvement of the CFIIm complex in the inflammatory processes underlying COPD, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target for this debilitating respiratory condition.
