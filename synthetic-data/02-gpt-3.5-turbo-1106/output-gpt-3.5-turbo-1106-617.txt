prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: SHREC. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The SWI/SNF-related matrix-associated actin-dependent regulator of chromatin (SHREC) complex is a crucial player in the regulation of chromatin structure and gene expression. Recent studies have demonstrated a direct association between SHREC and the progression of cancer, particularly in the context of breast cancer. Dysregulation of SHREC has been implicated in the development of several aggressive malignancies, including ovarian and prostate cancers. Furthermore, it has been observed that the dysregulation of SHREC contributes to the emergence of drug-resistant phenotypes in certain cancer cell lines. Targeting the SHREC complex may thus offer a promising avenue for the development of novel therapeutic strategies for cancer treatment. Understanding the intricate interplay between SHREC and various signaling pathways could unveil new opportunities for precision medicine approaches targeting cancer progression and resistance.
