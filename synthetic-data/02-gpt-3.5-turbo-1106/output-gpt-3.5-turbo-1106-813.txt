prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: Cryopyrin inflammasome. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: Activation of the Cryopyrin inflammasome has been implicated in numerous inflammatory disorders, including cryopyrin-associated periodic syndromes (CAPS) and systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS). The Cryopyrin inflammasome is known to recognize pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) and danger-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) as well as endogenous and exogenous danger signals. Upon activation, the Cryopyrin inflammasome recruits and activates caspase-1, leading to proteolytic cleavage and release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin-1Î² and interleukin-18. Targeting the Cryopyrin inflammasome has thus emerged as a promising therapeutic strategy for mitigating excessive inflammation and associated pathologies. Future studies are warranted to further elucidate the mechanistic underpinnings of Cryopyrin inflammasome activation and to identify novel pharmacological agents that can modulate its activity in the context of various inflammatory diseases.
