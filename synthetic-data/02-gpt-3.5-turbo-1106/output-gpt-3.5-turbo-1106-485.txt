prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: FtsQBL. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The FtsQBL protein complex has been identified as a key player in the regulation of bacterial cell division. Recent studies have implicated this complex in the precise coordination of cytokinesis, highlighting its significance in maintaining cellular integrity. The intricate interplay between the FtsQBL complex and other essential cell division proteins, such as FtsZ and FtsW, underscores its pivotal role in facilitating the formation of the septum during the late stages of cell division. Dysregulation of the FtsQBL complex has been associated with various pathological conditions, including bacterial infections and antibiotic resistance. Further elucidation of the molecular mechanisms governing the function of the FtsQBL complex may provide valuable insights for the development of novel antimicrobial strategies.
