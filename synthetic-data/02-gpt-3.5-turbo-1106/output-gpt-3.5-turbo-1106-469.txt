prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: cullin-RING ligase 4A. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we investigated the role of the cullin-RING ligase 4A (CRL4A) protein complex in the progression of prostate cancer. We conducted in vitro experiments using human prostate cancer cell lines and observed a significant upregulation of CRL4A expression in androgen-independent prostate cancer cells compared to androgen-dependent cells. Furthermore, we found that inhibition of CRL4A activity with a specific small molecule inhibitor led to a decrease in the proliferation and migration of prostate cancer cells. In addition, our in vivo studies using a mouse xenograft model demonstrated that targeting CRL4A resulted in a significant reduction in tumor growth and metastasis. These findings highlight the potential of CRL4A as a therapeutic target for the treatment of advanced prostate cancer.
