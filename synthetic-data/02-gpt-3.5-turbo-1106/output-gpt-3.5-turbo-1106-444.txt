prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: LSU. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we investigated the potential role of the LSU protein complex in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease. Utilizing a mouse model of Parkinson's disease, we observed a significant alteration in the expression levels of LSU in the substantia nigra region of the brain. Furthermore, we identified a correlation between LSU expression and the accumulation of alpha-synuclein aggregates in dopaminergic neurons. These findings suggest a possible involvement of LSU in the regulation of protein homeostasis and its implication in the neurodegenerative processes associated with Parkinson's disease. Our results provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying LSU function and its relevance to neurodegenerative disorders.
