prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: Cut1-2. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we sought to investigate the role of the Cut1-2 protein complex in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular disease. We utilized a murine model to examine the impact of genetic knockout of Cut1-2 on atherosclerotic lesion development. Our findings revealed that the absence of Cut1-2 led to a significant reduction in lesion size and severity, suggesting a potential protective role of this protein complex in atherosclerosis. Furthermore, we observed alterations in the expression of key inflammatory cytokines and chemokines in the absence of Cut1-2, implicating its involvement in the regulation of immune responses within the vessel wall. These results provide valuable insights into the function of Cut1-2 and its potential as a therapeutic target for cardiovascular diseases.
