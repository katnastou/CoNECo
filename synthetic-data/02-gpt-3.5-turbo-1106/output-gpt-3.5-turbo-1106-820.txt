prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: TREX-2. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The TREX-2 protein complex has recently emerged as a crucial player in the regulation of mRNA export from the nucleus to the cytoplasm in eukaryotic cells. This multifunctional complex is composed of several subunits, whose precise coordination is required for its proper function. Recent studies have highlighted the potential role of TREX-2 in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases, such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), through its influence on mRNA transport and processing. Understanding the intricate interplay of TREX-2 with other cellular components, including RNA-binding proteins and nuclear pore complexes, promises to shed light on fundamental cellular processes and may provide novel targets for therapeutic interventions in neurodegeneration. Further investigation into the regulation and function of TREX-2 is warranted to elucidate its precise role in health and disease.
