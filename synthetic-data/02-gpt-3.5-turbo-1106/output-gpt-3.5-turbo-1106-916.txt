prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: interleukin-2 receptor. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: Interleukin-2 receptor (IL-2R) is a critical protein complex involved in the immune response and is composed of three subunits: IL-2Rα, IL-2Rβ, and IL-2Rγ. Dysregulation of the IL-2 receptor has been implicated in various autoimmune diseases, such as type 1 diabetes and multiple sclerosis, where aberrant signaling through the IL-2 receptor leads to immune dysfunction and tissue damage. Recent studies have highlighted the potential of targeting the IL-2 receptor with monoclonal antibodies to modulate immune responses in the context of cancer immunotherapy. Furthermore, the IL-2 receptor plays a key role in T cell activation and proliferation, making it an attractive therapeutic target for immunomodulatory interventions. Understanding the signaling pathways and molecular mechanisms associated with the IL-2 receptor complex is crucial for the development of novel treatments for immune-related disorders and cancer.
