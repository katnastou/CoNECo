prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: membrane-bound IgD. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The membrane-bound IgD protein complex is a critical component of the B cell receptor signaling pathway. Recent studies have shown that the activation of membrane-bound IgD is essential for the initiation of an effective immune response against pathogens. Furthermore, dysregulation of membrane-bound IgD has been implicated in the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases, such as systemic lupus erythematosus and rheumatoid arthritis. Understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying the activation and regulation of membrane-bound IgD may offer new insights into the development of therapeutic strategies for the treatment of immune-related disorders. Overall, elucidating the role of membrane-bound IgD in immune function and disease pathogenesis represents a crucial area of investigation in biomedical research.
