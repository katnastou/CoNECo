prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: AMPA glutamate receptor. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we investigated the role of the AMPA glutamate receptor in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease. We utilized transgenic mouse models with overexpression of amyloid beta peptides to examine the effect of AMPA glutamate receptor modulation on cognitive function and neurodegeneration. Our findings indicate that upregulation of AMPA glutamate receptor activity exacerbates synaptic dysfunction and neurotoxicity in the presence of amyloid beta accumulation. Furthermore, pharmacological inhibition of the AMPA glutamate receptor ameliorated cognitive deficits and attenuated neuronal loss in the hippocampus. These results provide novel insights into the potential therapeutic targeting of AMPA glutamate receptors for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease.
