prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: DNA-directed RNA polymerase III. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The DNA-directed RNA polymerase III (Pol III) is a crucial enzyme responsible for the transcription of genes encoding small structural RNAs such as tRNAs and 5S rRNA. Dysregulation of Pol III activity has been implicated in various human diseases, including cancer and developmental disorders. In a recent study, the interaction between Pol III and the tumor suppressor protein p53 was investigated in the context of mediating cellular responses to stress and DNA damage. The findings revealed that p53 exerts a regulatory role on Pol III transcription, suggesting a potential link between Pol III activity and the p53 signaling pathway in the context of cancer development and progression. Understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying the regulation of Pol III function may provide valuable insights for the development of targeted therapeutic strategies for cancer and other human diseases.
