prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: PDGF-AA-receptor alpha. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The expression and function of the PDGF-AA-receptor alpha complex have been studied extensively in the context of cancer biology. Previous research has identified a crucial role for this complex in mediating the proliferative and migratory effects of PDGF-AA in cancer cells, and its overexpression has been associated with disease progression and poor prognosis in various types of cancer. Furthermore, targeting the PDGF-AA-receptor alpha complex has emerged as a promising therapeutic strategy for inhibiting tumor growth and metastasis. In addition to cancer, the involvement of this complex in other pathophysiological processes, such as fibrosis and vascular remodeling, has also been a subject of investigation. This body of work underscores the significance of the PDGF-AA-receptor alpha complex as a potential therapeutic target across a variety of human diseases.
