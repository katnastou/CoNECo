prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: Tenascin-C. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The extracellular matrix (ECM) protein complex Tenascin-C has been implicated in a wide range of physiological and pathological processes. A growing body of evidence suggests that Tenascin-C plays a key role in tissue development, remodeling, and repair. Elevated levels of Tenascin-C have been associated with various pathological conditions, including cancer, fibrosis, and cardiovascular diseases. Furthermore, studies in animal models have demonstrated the involvement of Tenascin-C in the regulation of cell adhesion, migration, and proliferation. The intricate interactions between Tenascin-C and various cellular signaling pathways highlight the potential of targeting this protein complex for therapeutic interventions in several human diseases. Further investigation into the molecular mechanisms underlying the functions of Tenascin-C may uncover novel therapeutic strategies for addressing a wide spectrum of diseases.
