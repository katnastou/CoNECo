prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: MICOS. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The mitochondrial contact site and cristae organizing system (MICOS) is a conserved protein complex that plays a crucial role in maintaining mitochondrial structure and function. Dysfunction of MICOS has been associated with various human diseases, including neurodegenerative disorders and metabolic syndromes. Recent studies have revealed the involvement of MICOS in the regulation of mitochondrial dynamics, as well as its interaction with other organelles such as the endoplasmic reticulum. Furthermore, alterations in MICOS expression have been implicated in the progression of mitochondrial-related diseases, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target. Understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying MICOS function and its impact on cellular homeostasis may provide valuable insights for developing novel treatments for a range of debilitating conditions.
