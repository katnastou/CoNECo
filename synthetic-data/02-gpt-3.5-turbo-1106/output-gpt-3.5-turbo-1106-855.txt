prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: alphaM-beta2 integrin. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The alphaM-beta2 integrin protein complex has been implicated in various inflammatory responses and is considered an essential mediator of leukocyte transmigration. Several studies have demonstrated the critical role of alphaM-beta2 integrin in the adhesion and migration of leukocytes to sites of infection and inflammation. In particular, the interaction of alphaM-beta2 integrin with its ligands, such as ICAM-1 and ICAM-3, has been shown to be crucial for the recruitment and activation of leukocytes, contributing to the pathogenesis of inflammatory conditions like rheumatoid arthritis and atherosclerosis. Targeting the alphaM-beta2 integrin complex has emerged as a potential therapeutic strategy for modulating leukocyte recruitment and attenuating inflammation in various disease states. Further investigations into the precise mechanisms underlying alphaM-beta2 integrin-mediated leukocyte adhesion and migration are warranted to uncover novel avenues for therapeutic intervention in inflammatory diseases.
