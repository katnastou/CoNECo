prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: PDGF-AB-receptor alpha. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The study aimed to investigate the role of the PDGF-AB-receptor alpha protein complex in the progression of atherosclerosis. Utilizing a murine model of atherosclerosis, we observed a significant upregulation of PDGF-AB-receptor alpha expression in atherosclerotic plaques compared to healthy vascular tissue. Furthermore, our findings demonstrated a strong correlation between PDGF-AB-receptor alpha levels and the degree of macrophage infiltration and foam cell formation within the atherosclerotic lesions. In addition, treatment with a specific inhibitor of the PDGF-AB-receptor alpha complex resulted in a reduction in plaque size and a decrease in the inflammatory response in the arterial wall. These results suggest that targeting the PDGF-AB-receptor alpha complex may hold therapeutic potential for inhibiting the progression of atherosclerosis and reducing associated cardiovascular complications.
