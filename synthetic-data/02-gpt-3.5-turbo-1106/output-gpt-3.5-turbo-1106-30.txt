prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: prefoldin. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The prefoldin protein complex has been implicated in numerous biological processes, including protein folding and cytoskeletal organization. Recent studies have suggested that prefoldin may also play a role in the development of neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease. Furthermore, the upregulation of prefoldin expression has been observed in various cancer types, indicating its potential involvement in tumorigenesis. Additionally, it has been proposed that the dysregulation of prefoldin could contribute to the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis. These findings underscore the importance of further investigating the molecular mechanisms underlying the diverse functions of prefoldin in health and disease.
