prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: Kir6.2-SUR. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we investigated the impact of a novel pharmacological intervention targeting the Kir6.2-SUR complex in a mouse model of type 2 diabetes. Administration of the compound resulted in a significant decrease in blood glucose levels and improvement in insulin sensitivity compared to the control group. Histological analysis revealed reduced hepatic steatosis and improved pancreatic islet morphology in treated animals. Furthermore, molecular profiling indicated a downregulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines in adipose tissue. These findings suggest that modulation of the Kir6.2-SUR complex presents a promising therapeutic approach for type 2 diabetes and its associated complications.
