prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: AP-4 adaptor. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: Recent studies have highlighted the role of the AP-4 adaptor protein complex in the pathogenesis of neurodevelopmental disorders, particularly in the context of autism spectrum disorders (ASD). The AP-4 adaptor complex has been implicated in the intracellular trafficking and sorting of various cargo molecules, including neurotransmitter receptors and ion channels, which are crucial for proper synaptic function and neuronal communication. Aberrant functioning of the AP-4 adaptor complex has been associated with disruptions in neurotransmission and synaptic plasticity, leading to cognitive and behavioral abnormalities observed in individuals with ASD. Understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying the involvement of the AP-4 adaptor complex in synaptic dysfunction may provide valuable insights for the development of targeted therapeutic interventions for ASD and other related neurodevelopmental conditions.
