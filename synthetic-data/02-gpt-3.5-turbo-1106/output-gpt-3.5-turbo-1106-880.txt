prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: MetNIQ. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we investigated the role of the MetNIQ protein complex in the regulation of cysteine metabolism in Salmonella enterica. Our findings demonstrate that the MetNIQ complex plays a crucial role in the transport and utilization of sulfur-containing amino acids. Through a series of genetic knockout experiments, we confirmed that the absence of the MetNIQ complex led to a significant reduction in cysteine uptake and diminished growth in media deficient in cysteine. Furthermore, we observed a correlation between the dysregulation of the MetNIQ complex and increased susceptibility to oxidative stress, highlighting its potential involvement in the cellular response to reactive oxygen species. This study sheds light on the importance of the MetNIQ complex in sulfur amino acid metabolism and its potential as a target for therapeutic interventions in bacterial infections.
