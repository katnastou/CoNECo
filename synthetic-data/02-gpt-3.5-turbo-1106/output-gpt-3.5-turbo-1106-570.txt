prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: NEXT. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The nuclear export factor, NEXT, has been recognized as a crucial player in the regulation of mRNA export from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. Studies have indicated that NEXT interacts with a variety of proteins involved in mRNA processing and export, including RNA helicases and transport factors. Additionally, dysregulation of NEXT has been implicated in the pathogenesis of certain neurodegenerative diseases, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target. Furthermore, the identification of small molecule inhibitors targeting NEXT may offer new strategies for intervention in diseases associated with impaired mRNA export machinery. Further investigation into the molecular mechanisms and regulatory pathways involving NEXT is warranted to fully elucidate its role in cellular homeostasis and disease pathogenesis.
