prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: MPCOX. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we investigated the association between MPCOX and mitochondrial dysfunction in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Using a cohort of T2DM patients, we observed a significant upregulation of MPCOX levels in skeletal muscle tissue. Furthermore, using immunofluorescence microscopy and Western blot analysis, we found an increased colocalization of MPCOX with mitochondrial markers, indicating its potential involvement in mitochondrial function. Additionally, we observed a correlation between elevated MPCOX expression and insulin resistance, suggesting a potential link between MPCOX and T2DM pathogenesis. Our findings highlight the potential role of MPCOX in the pathophysiology of T2DM and suggest it may serve as a promising therapeutic target for mitigating mitochondrial dysfunction in this patient population.
