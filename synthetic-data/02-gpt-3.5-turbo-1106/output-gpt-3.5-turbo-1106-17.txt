prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: UTP-A. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we investigate the role of the UTP-A complex in the regulation of ribosomal RNA synthesis. Our findings demonstrate a novel interaction between UTP-A and the signaling pathways involved in cellular stress response. Using a combination of chemical inhibition and genetic manipulation, we show that UTP-A activity can be modulated to affect the cellular response to oxidative stress. Furthermore, we observed that perturbation of UTP-A function leads to dysregulation of ribosomal RNA transcription, resulting in impaired ribosome biogenesis and a subsequent decrease in overall protein synthesis. These insights suggest a potential link between UTP-A and cellular responses to oxidative stress, implicating UTP-A as a potential therapeutic target for conditions associated with impaired protein synthesis and cellular stress, such as neurodegenerative diseases and cancer.
