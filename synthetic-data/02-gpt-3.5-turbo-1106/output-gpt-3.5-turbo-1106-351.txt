prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: Geranylgeranyl transferase type II. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: Geranylgeranyl transferase type II (GGTII) is a critical enzyme involved in the post-translational modification of certain target proteins, known to play essential roles in the regulation of cell signaling and membrane trafficking. Its aberrant activity has been associated with various pathological conditions, including cancer, cardiovascular diseases, and neurodegenerative disorders. Inhibition of GGTII has emerged as a promising strategy for therapeutic intervention in diseases such as cancer, due to its potential to disrupt cancer cell proliferation and metastasis. Additionally, GGTII has been implicated in the pathogenesis of metabolic disorders, highlighting its significance in health and disease. Furthermore, the study of GGTII and its substrates has provided important insights into the regulation of cellular processes and its dysregulation in disease, offering potential targets for diagnostic and therapeutic interventions.
