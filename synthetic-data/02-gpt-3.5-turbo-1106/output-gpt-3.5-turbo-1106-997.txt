prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: SufS. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The SufS protein complex has been implicated in the pathogenesis of various neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease. Recent findings have highlighted the crucial role of SufS in the regulation of iron-sulfur cluster biogenesis, a process essential for the functioning of numerous cellular enzymes involved in key metabolic pathways. Additionally, dysregulation of SufS activity has been associated with mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress, suggesting a potential link between SufS and the development of neurodegenerative disorders. Elucidating the molecular mechanisms underlying the involvement of SufS in these diseases may pave the way for the development of novel therapeutic strategies aimed at restoring iron homeostasis and mitigating neuronal damage.
