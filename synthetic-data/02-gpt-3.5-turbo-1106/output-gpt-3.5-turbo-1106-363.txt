prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: Intrinsic tenase. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: A characteristic hallmark of hemophilia A is the deficiency or dysfunction of clotting factor VIII, which leads to impaired hemostasis and excessive bleeding. Central to the formation of a stable blood clot is the assembly and regulation of the intrinsic tenase complex, a critical enzyme involved in the coagulation cascade. Previous studies have demonstrated that aberrations in the intrinsic tenase complex contribute to the pathophysiology of hemophilia A, presenting potential targets for therapeutic intervention. Understanding the dynamic interplay of coagulation factors and inhibitors in the intrinsic tenase complex is crucial for advancing the development of treatments aimed at restoring hemostasis in individuals with hemophilia A. This research thus sheds light on the intricate molecular mechanisms that govern clot formation and provides valuable insights into potential strategies for managing hemostatic disorders.
