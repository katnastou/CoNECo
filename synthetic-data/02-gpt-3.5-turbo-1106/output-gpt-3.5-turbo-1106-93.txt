prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: phenylacetyl-CoA 1,2-epoxidase. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The phenylacetyl-CoA 1,2-epoxidase is a key enzyme involved in the metabolism of certain aromatic compounds in bacteria and fungi. Research has shown that this enzyme plays a crucial role in the degradation of phenylacetic acid, a precursor of several important natural products. Deficiency or inhibition of phenylacetyl-CoA 1,2-epoxidase activity has been linked to the accumulation of toxic intermediates and the disruption of metabolic pathways. Furthermore, studies have indicated a potential association between altered phenylacetyl-CoA 1,2-epoxidase function and the pathogenesis of certain microbial infections. Understanding the regulation and function of this enzyme has significant implications for the development of novel antimicrobial strategies and the engineering of microbial metabolic pathways for biotechnological applications.
