prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: PaoABC periplasmic aldehyde oxidoreductase. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we investigated the role of the PaoABC periplasmic aldehyde oxidoreductase complex in the catabolism of aldehydes in the bacterium Pseudomonas aeruginosa. We found that disruption of the PaoABC complex led to a significant decrease in the ability of the bacterium to metabolize aldehydes, resulting in the accumulation of toxic aldehyde intermediates within the cell. Furthermore, we identified a novel small molecule inhibitor that specifically targets the PaoABC complex, leading to a potent bactericidal effect against P. aeruginosa. Our findings suggest that targeting the PaoABC complex may represent a promising strategy for the development of novel therapeutics against Pseudomonas infections.
