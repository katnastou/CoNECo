prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: interleukin-9 receptor. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The interleukin-9 receptor has been implicated in several human diseases, including asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Previous studies have shown that interleukin-9 receptor signaling plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of these conditions. In a recent study, investigators sought to elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying the dysregulation of interleukin-9 receptor in the context of asthma. Using an animal model of allergic airway inflammation, the researchers demonstrated that the upregulation of interleukin-9 receptor expression in airway epithelial cells was associated with increased disease severity. Furthermore, pharmacological inhibition of interleukin-9 receptor signaling ameliorated airway hyperresponsiveness and inflammation. These findings highlight the potential therapeutic utility of targeting the interleukin-9 receptor pathway in the treatment of asthma and related respiratory disorders.
