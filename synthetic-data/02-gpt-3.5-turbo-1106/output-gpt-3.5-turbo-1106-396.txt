prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: CysPTWAM. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: Recent studies have shown the potential involvement of the protein complex CysPTWAM in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular diseases. CysPTWAM has been implicated in the regulation of oxidative stress and inflammation, both of which are known to play key roles in the development of cardiovascular disorders. Moreover, dysregulation of CysPTWAM has been associated with impaired vascular function and endothelial dysfunction. Additionally, experimental evidence has suggested that targeting CysPTWAM may have therapeutic implications for mitigating the progression of atherosclerosis and other related conditions. Further investigation into the molecular mechanisms underlying the role of CysPTWAM in cardiovascular pathophysiology is warranted, with the potential to contribute to the development of novel treatment strategies for these prevalent and debilitating diseases.
