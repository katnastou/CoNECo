prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: MRN. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The MRN protein complex plays a crucial role in the DNA damage response pathway, and its dysregulation is associated with various human diseases, including ataxia-telangiectasia-like disorder and breast cancer. In this study, we aimed to investigate the impact of small molecule inhibitors on the functionality of the MRN complex in the context of neurodegenerative disorders. We identified a novel chemical compound that demonstrated a potent inhibitory effect on the MRN complex, leading to reduced activation of ATM and downstream effector proteins involved in DNA repair. Our findings suggest a potential therapeutic strategy for targeting the MRN complex in the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases.
