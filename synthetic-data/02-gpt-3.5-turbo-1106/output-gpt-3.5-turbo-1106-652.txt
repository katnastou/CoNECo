prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: 5HT3AR. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The 5HT3AR protein complex, referred to as the 5-hydroxytryptamine type 3A receptor, is a ligand-gated cation channel expressed in the central and peripheral nervous systems. Activation of the 5HT3AR has been associated with various physiological and pathological conditions, including nausea, vomiting, and anxiety. Recent studies have revealed potential interactions between the 5HT3AR and serotonin, implicating the receptor complex in the modulation of serotonin signaling pathways. Furthermore, the 5HT3AR has been shown to be a potential target for antiemetic and anxiolytic drugs. Understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying the function and regulation of the 5HT3AR complex may provide insights for the development of novel therapeutic strategies for the management of conditions associated with altered serotonin signaling.
