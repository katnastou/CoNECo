prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: fibrillar collagen trimer. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we investigated the role of the fibrillar collagen trimer in the pathogenesis of osteogenesis imperfecta, a rare genetic disorder characterized by brittle bones and skeletal deformities. Using a murine model with a targeted disruption of the fibrillar collagen trimer gene, we observed a significant decrease in bone mineral density and impaired bone formation, demonstrating the crucial role of this protein complex in maintaining skeletal integrity. Furthermore, our findings suggest that mutations in the fibrillar collagen trimer gene may be a key determinant in the development of severe bone fragility and susceptibility to fractures in individuals with osteogenesis imperfecta. This insight into the molecular basis of the disease may facilitate the development of targeted therapeutic strategies to improve bone strength and quality in affected individuals.
