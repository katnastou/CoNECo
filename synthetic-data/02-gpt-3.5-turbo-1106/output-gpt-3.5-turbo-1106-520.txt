prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: FceRI. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: Recent studies have indicated a potential role for the FceRI protein complex in the pathogenesis of allergic diseases such as asthma and atopic dermatitis. The FceRI complex, which is expressed on the surface of mast cells and basophils, functions as a high-affinity receptor for immunoglobulin E (IgE). Activation of FceRI by IgE binding leads to the release of inflammatory mediators, resulting in the characteristic symptoms of allergic reactions. Notably, the dysregulation of FceRI signaling has been implicated in the amplification of allergic responses and the development of chronic allergic diseases. Furthermore, targeting the FceRI complex has emerged as a potential therapeutic strategy for the management of allergic disorders. These findings underscore the significance of elucidating the molecular mechanisms underlying FceRI-mediated allergic immune responses and highlight the potential importance of FceRI as a therapeutic target for allergic diseases.
