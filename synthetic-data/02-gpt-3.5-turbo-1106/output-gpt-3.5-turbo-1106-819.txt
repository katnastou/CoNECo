prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: matrilin-2. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The extracellular matrix (ECM) plays a critical role in maintaining tissue structure and function. Within the ECM, the matrilin-2 protein complex has been associated with the regulation of cartilage development and maintenance. Emerging evidence suggests that matrilin-2 may be involved in modulating the activity of various growth factors and cytokines, thereby affecting cellular processes such as proliferation, differentiation, and survival. Dysregulation of matrilin-2 has been implicated in the pathogenesis of osteoarthritis, a common degenerative joint disease characterized by cartilage degradation and joint pain. Understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying the function of matrilin-2 in the ECM may provide new insights into the development of therapeutic strategies for osteoarthritis and other cartilage-related disorders.
