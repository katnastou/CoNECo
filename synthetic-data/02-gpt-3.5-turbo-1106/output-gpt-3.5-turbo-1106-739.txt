prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: condensin. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The condensin protein complex plays a critical role in the organization and compaction of chromatin during various cell processes, particularly during cell division. Recent studies have highlighted the involvement of condensin in the maintenance of genome stability and proper chromosome segregation. Dysregulation of condensin has been linked to a variety of diseases, including cancer and developmental disorders. Furthermore, the interaction of condensin with other cellular components, such as the spindle apparatus and regulatory proteins, underscores the intricate molecular mechanisms underlying its function. Understanding the precise molecular dynamics and regulatory pathways involving condensin is crucial for elucidating its potential as a therapeutic target for diseases associated with chromosomal instability.
