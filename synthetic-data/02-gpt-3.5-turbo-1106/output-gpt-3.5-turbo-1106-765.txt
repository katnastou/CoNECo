prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: xseAB. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The xseAB protein complex has been implicated in a variety of cellular processes, including DNA repair and recombination in the model organism Escherichia coli. Recent studies have suggested a potential role for xseAB in the response to oxidative stress and its association with the development of oxidative damage-related diseases. The interaction of xseAB with small molecule inhibitors has also been characterized, highlighting the potential for targeted therapeutic interventions. Further investigation into the regulatory mechanisms governing the activity of xseAB may shed light on its broader physiological significance and potential implications for human health.
