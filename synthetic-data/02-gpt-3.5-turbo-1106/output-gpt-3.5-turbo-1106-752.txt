prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: mitotic cohesin. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The mitotic cohesin protein complex plays a critical role in maintaining genome stability during cell division. Dysregulation of mitotic cohesin has been linked to various developmental disorders and cancer. Recent studies have uncovered the importance of post-translational modifications in regulating the functions of mitotic cohesin. For instance, phosphorylation of specific subunits has been shown to influence the loading and release of mitotic cohesin, impacting chromosome segregation during mitosis. Furthermore, the interaction between mitotic cohesin and other proteins, such as the condensin complex, underscores its intricate role in organizing chromatin structure. Understanding the molecular mechanisms governing mitotic cohesin function holds great promise for the development of targeted therapies for diseases associated with genomic instability.
