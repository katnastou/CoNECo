prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: TGFB. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The role of the TGFB protein complex in the pathogenesis of fibrotic disorders has garnered considerable attention in recent years. Dysregulation of TGFB signaling has been implicated in the development and progression of systemic sclerosis, a devastating autoimmune disease characterized by excessive fibrosis in the skin and internal organs. Additionally, studies have suggested that aberrant activation of the TGFB complex may contribute to the pathogenesis of other fibrotic conditions, including idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and liver fibrosis. Given the significant impact of these diseases on patient morbidity and mortality, understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying TGFB complex activation and its downstream effects presents an important opportunity for the development of targeted therapeutic interventions.
