prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: centralspindlin. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The centralspindlin protein complex plays a pivotal role in cytokinesis, the final stage of cell division. Comprising the proteins CYK4 and MgcRacGAP, centralspindlin is essential for the proper assembly and function of the midzone during cytokinesis. Numerous studies have demonstrated that centralspindlin functions as a critical regulator of Rho GTPase signaling, coordinating actin and myosin dynamics in the contractile ring and promoting successful cleavage furrow ingression. Dysregulation of centralspindlin has been implicated in various pathological conditions, including cancer, where aberrant cytokinesis contributes to tumorigenesis and metastasis. Therefore, understanding the mechanisms underlying centralspindlin function holds great promise for developing targeted therapies in cancer treatment and other diseases involving abnormal cell division.
