prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: LsrACDB. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In recent years, studies have revealed a crucial role for the LsrACDB protein complex in the regulation of quorum sensing in bacteria, including several important human pathogens. Quorum sensing is a mechanism by which bacteria coordinate their gene expression in response to changes in population density. LsrACDB has been shown to mediate the import of autoinducer-2 (AI-2), a critical signaling molecule involved in interspecies communication among bacteria. Disruption of the LsrACDB complex has been demonstrated to have profound effects on biofilm formation, virulence factor production, and antibiotic resistance in various bacterial species. Given the importance of quorum sensing in the pathogenicity of many bacteria, targeting the LsrACDB complex may hold promise for the development of novel therapeutic strategies against bacterial infections.
