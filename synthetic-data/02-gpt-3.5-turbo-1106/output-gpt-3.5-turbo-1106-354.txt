prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: Syp1. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: Recent studies have shown the involvement of the Syp1 protein complex in the regulation of synaptic plasticity in neurological disorders such as Alzheimer's disease. The complex has been found to modulate the interactions between glutamate receptors and scaffolding proteins, leading to alterations in synaptic strength and plasticity. Furthermore, dysregulation of Syp1 has been implicated in the impairment of learning and memory processes. Therefore, understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying the function of Syp1 may provide valuable insights into the pathophysiology of neurodegenerative diseases and offer potential therapeutic targets for the treatment of synaptic dysfunction in such conditions.
