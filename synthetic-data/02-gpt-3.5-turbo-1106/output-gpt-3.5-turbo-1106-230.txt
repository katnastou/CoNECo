prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: alpha5-beta1 integrin. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The alpha5-beta1 integrin protein complex is a crucial mediator of cell adhesion and migration processes that are key to tumor progression and metastasis. In the context of various cancers, dysregulation of the alpha5-beta1 integrin complex has been shown to promote invasiveness and metastatic potential. Recent studies have indicated a potential therapeutic approach targeting the interaction between fibronectin and alpha5-beta1 integrin to inhibit the invasive phenotype of melanoma cells. Furthermore, the role of alpha5-beta1 integrin in inflammatory processes and fibrosis suggests its potential as a therapeutic target for chronic inflammatory diseases and fibrotic disorders. The interaction of alpha5-beta1 integrin with its ligands in the tumor microenvironment has emerged as a promising area for further investigation, offering potential avenues for the development of novel targeted therapies.
