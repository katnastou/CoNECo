prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: SR. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The SR protein complex plays a crucial role in regulating alternative splicing events in eukaryotic cells. Recent studies have identified a potential association between the activity of the SR complex and the progression of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's. The SR complex has been implicated in the post-transcriptional regulation of various genes involved in neuronal signaling and maintenance of synaptic function. Furthermore, evidence suggests that dysregulation of the SR complex may contribute to aberrant RNA splicing patterns observed in neurodegenerative disorders, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target for mitigating the molecular mechanisms underlying these debilitating conditions. Understanding the precise molecular interactions and regulatory networks involving the SR complex may provide valuable insights into the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases, potentially paving the way for the development of novel therapeutic interventions.
