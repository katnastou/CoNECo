prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: HDAC3. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: Histone deacetylase 3 (HDAC3) is a crucial epigenetic regulator that has been implicated in various biological processes, including gene expression, cell differentiation, and development. HDAC3 forms a complex with other protein partners, such as nuclear receptor corepressor (NCOR) and silencing mediator of retinoic and thyroid hormone receptors (SMRT), to exert its regulatory functions. Dysregulation of HDAC3 activity has been associated with numerous diseases, including cancer, cardiovascular disorders, and neurological conditions. Given the key role of HDAC3 in epigenetic regulation, targeting this complex has emerged as an attractive therapeutic strategy for various diseases. In addition to its role in gene regulation, HDAC3 has been linked to metabolic processes, with potential implications for metabolic diseases such as diabetes and obesity. Therefore, elucidating the precise mechanisms of action of the HDAC3 complex may provide important insights for the development of novel therapeutic interventions.
