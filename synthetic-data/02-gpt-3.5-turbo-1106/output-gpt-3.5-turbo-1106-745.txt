prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: basal TBC. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The basal TBC protein complex has been implicated in various cellular pathways and is thought to play a critical role in cellular homeostasis. Recent studies have highlighted the involvement of the basal TBC complex in the regulation of cell proliferation and apoptosis. Furthermore, dysregulation of the basal TBC complex has been linked to several human diseases, including certain cancers and neurodegenerative disorders. Understanding the precise molecular mechanisms governing the activity of the basal TBC complex may provide valuable insights into disease pathogenesis and pave the way for the development of targeted therapeutic interventions. Further exploration of the interactions and functions of the basal TBC complex in various cellular contexts is crucial for elucidating its physiological significance and potential as a therapeutic target.
