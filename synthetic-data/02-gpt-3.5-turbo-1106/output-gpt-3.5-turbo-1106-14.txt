prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: CRL5. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: Recent studies have demonstrated the critical role of the CRL5 protein complex in regulating cell cycle progression and cellular proliferation. The CRL5 complex has been shown to function as an E3 ubiquitin ligase, targeting various substrates for proteasomal degradation, including those involved in the regulation of DNA replication and mitotic checkpoints. Dysregulation of CRL5 activity has been implicated in the pathogenesis of certain cancers, such as colorectal carcinoma and breast cancer. Moreover, small molecule inhibitors targeting CRL5 have shown promising results in preclinical models, suggesting a potential therapeutic strategy for cancer treatment. Further investigation into the molecular mechanisms underlying CRL5 function and its potential as a therapeutic target is warranted to exploit its role in cancer progression and metastasis.
