prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: FN-TGM2. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The FN-TGM2 protein complex has been implicated in the pathogenesis of several diseases, including celiac disease and fibrosis. Previous studies have demonstrated that the interaction between fibronectin (FN) and transglutaminase 2 (TGM2) is crucial in the deposition of extracellular matrix proteins, leading to tissue remodeling and fibrotic changes. Furthermore, TGM2 has been shown to play a role in the crosslinking of fibronectin, contributing to the stabilization of the extracellular matrix. Given the importance of the FN-TGM2 complex in disease progression, targeting this complex may hold promise for the development of novel therapeutic strategies for conditions characterized by aberrant tissue remodeling and fibrosis.
