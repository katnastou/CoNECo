prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: CPS. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The Lysosomal Cysteine Protease System (CPS) is a critical complex of proteolytic enzymes within the lysosome that plays a central role in the degradation of cellular proteins and maintenance of cellular homeostasis. Dysfunction of CPS has been implicated in various lysosomal storage disorders, such as cystinosis and neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis. Recent studies have also highlighted the involvement of CPS in the turnover of misfolded proteins and the regulation of autophagy, linking its dysfunction to neurodegenerative diseases like Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease. Moreover, CPS has been shown to interact with various small molecule inhibitors, further emphasizing its potential as a therapeutic target for the treatment of lysosomal storage disorders and neurodegenerative diseases. Understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying the function and regulation of CPS presents a promising avenue for the development of novel therapeutic interventions targeting these debilitating diseases.
