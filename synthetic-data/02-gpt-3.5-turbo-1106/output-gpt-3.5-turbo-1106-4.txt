prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: IL-18 receptor. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The IL-18 receptor is a vital mediator of the immune response, playing a crucial role in the pathogenesis of various inflammatory diseases. Activation of the IL-18 receptor leads to downstream signaling events that ultimately modulate the production and secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines, contributing to the progression of conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease, and psoriasis. Recent studies have implicated dysregulation of the IL-18 receptor in the etiology of these diseases, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target. Furthermore, crosstalk between the IL-18 receptor and other immune signaling pathways underscores its significance in orchestrating the complex network of immune responses. Understanding the intricate mechanisms governing IL-18 receptor signaling is therefore imperative for advancing the development of targeted therapies for inflammatory disorders.
