prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: GOGAT. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we investigated the function of the GOGAT protein complex in the context of nitrogen metabolism in Arabidopsis thaliana. We observed that mutants lacking the GOGAT complex exhibited reduced growth and chlorosis, characteristic of nitrogen deficiency. Furthermore, our metabolomic analysis revealed altered levels of key nitrogen-containing compounds, such as glutamine and glutamate, in the GOGAT-deficient plants. We also examined the expression patterns of genes involved in nitrogen assimilation and found that the GOGAT complex plays a critical role in regulating the transcription of these genes. Our findings shed light on the importance of the GOGAT complex in maintaining nitrogen homeostasis in plants, and may have implications for improving nitrogen use efficiency in agricultural crops.
