prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: dRAF. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we investigate the role of the dRAF protein complex in the pathogenesis of colorectal cancer, a prevalent malignancy characterized by dysregulated cell proliferation and survival. We analyzed tissue samples from colorectal cancer patients and observed a significant upregulation of dRAF expression compared to healthy colon tissue. Furthermore, our in vitro experiments using colorectal cancer cell lines demonstrated that inhibition of dRAF activity with small molecule inhibitors resulted in a marked decrease in cell viability and proliferation. Importantly, our findings suggest that dRAF may serve as a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of colorectal cancer, warranting further exploration of dRAF-targeted interventions in preclinical and clinical settings.
