prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: THSC. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The interaction between the transcription factor 1 (TF1) and the THSC protein complex has been identified as a key regulator of cellular differentiation in adipose tissue. Previous studies have shown that the expression of TF1 is significantly elevated in adipocytes undergoing adipogenesis. However, the specific role of the THSC complex in this process has remained unclear. In this study, we investigated the molecular mechanisms underlying the interaction between TF1 and the THSC complex in adipocyte differentiation. Our results demonstrate that TF1 directly interacts with the THSC complex, leading to the upregulation of key adipogenic genes. Furthermore, inhibition of the THSC complex resulted in impaired adipocyte differentiation, highlighting the critical role of THSC in adipogenesis. These findings provide essential insights into the regulatory network governing adipocyte differentiation and offer potential therapeutic targets for obesity-related disorders.
