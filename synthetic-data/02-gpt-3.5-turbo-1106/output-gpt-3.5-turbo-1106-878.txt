prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: VPS4. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: Recent studies have highlighted the intricate role of the VPS4 complex in cellular homeostasis and disease pathology. VPS4, a key regulator of endosomal sorting complexes required for transport (ESCRT) machinery, has been implicated in various cellular processes, including membrane remodeling and protein trafficking. Dysregulation of VPS4 has been associated with neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's disease and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Additionally, emerging evidence suggests that VPS4 may play a crucial role in viral budding and pathogenesis, making it a potential target for antiviral therapies. Despite recent advancements in understanding the functional significance of VPS4, further research is warranted to elucidate its precise molecular mechanisms and potential therapeutic implications in various disease settings.
