prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: interleukin-23. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In recent years, significant attention has been directed towards the role of interleukin-23 (IL-23) in the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases. IL-23, a member of the IL-12 family of cytokines, has emerged as a key player in the regulation of immune responses, particularly in the context of chronic inflammatory conditions. Mounting evidence suggests that dysregulation of IL-23 signaling is closely associated with the development and progression of several autoimmune disorders, including psoriasis, inflammatory bowel disease, and rheumatoid arthritis. Therefore, targeting the IL-23 pathway has garnered considerable interest as a potential therapeutic strategy for these debilitating diseases. This growing body of research underscores the importance of further elucidating the intricate mechanisms underlying IL-23-mediated immune dysregulation, with the ultimate goal of harnessing this knowledge to develop more effective treatments for autoimmune disorders.
