prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: interleukin-3 receptor. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we investigated the role of interleukin-3 receptor in the pathogenesis of asthma. Our findings revealed a significant upregulation of interleukin-3 receptor expression in bronchial epithelial cells from asthmatic patients compared to healthy controls. Furthermore, we observed a positive correlation between interleukin-3 receptor levels and disease severity, as indicated by forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) measurements. Pharmacological inhibition of interleukin-3 receptor signaling using a specific antagonist attenuated airway inflammation and mucus production in a murine model of allergic asthma. These results suggest that targeting interleukin-3 receptor may represent a promising therapeutic strategy for the treatment of asthma.
