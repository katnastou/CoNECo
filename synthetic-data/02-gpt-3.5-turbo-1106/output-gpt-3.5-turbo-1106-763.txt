prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: RNApII. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: RNApII, a pivotal enzyme complex involved in the transcription of genetic information, has been the subject of intensive investigation due to its central role in cellular function. Recent studies have identified a potential regulatory mechanism involving the interaction between RNApII and specific small molecule inhibitors. Additionally, research has suggested a potential link between RNApII dysregulation and the pathogenesis of certain neurological disorders. Understanding the intricate interplay between RNApII and its modulators holds promise for the development of novel therapeutic strategies targeting diseases associated with transcriptional dysfunction.
