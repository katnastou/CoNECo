prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: DDS. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The development and progression of metastatic breast cancer, a devastating disease with high mortality rates, are influenced by various molecular pathways. In this study, we investigated the role of the DNA damage-specific sirtuin 1 (DDS) protein complex in the regulation of cancer cell growth and survival. Through a series of in vitro and in vivo experiments, we demonstrate that the activity of DDS is crucial for the maintenance of genomic stability and the suppression of tumor growth. Additionally, we found that the expression of DDS is dysregulated in aggressive breast cancer subtypes, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer. This study sheds light on the importance of DDS in cancer biology and provides insights into its potential as a novel target for precision oncology strategies.
