prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: SQR. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The SQR protein complex has been implicated in the pathogenesis of mitochondrial diseases, particularly those related to the electron transport chain. Recent studies have revealed a potential role for SQR in modulating the redox balance within the mitochondria, which may impact cellular homeostasis and contribute to disease progression. Furthermore, investigations into SQR interactions with small molecule inhibitors have demonstrated the potential for targeted drug development in diseases such as Leigh syndrome and mitochondrial encephalomyopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episodes (MELAS). This emerging understanding of SQR's involvement in mitochondrial dysfunction presents a promising avenue for therapeutic intervention and warrants further investigation into its molecular mechanisms and potential clinical applications.
