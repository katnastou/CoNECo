prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: Ferric coprogen receptor. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we investigate the role of the Ferric coprogen receptor in iron homeostasis in the context of Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection. Our results demonstrate a significant upregulation of the Ferric coprogen receptor in macrophages exposed to M. tuberculosis, which suggests a potential link between this protein complex and the pathogenesis of tuberculosis. Additionally, we found that the expression of the Ferric coprogen receptor is modulated by the presence of iron in the host environment, highlighting its importance in iron metabolism during infection. These findings provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying M. tuberculosis pathogenesis and lay the groundwork for further exploration of the Ferric coprogen receptor as a potential therapeutic target for tuberculosis.
