prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: T cell receptor. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The T cell receptor (TCR) plays a crucial role in the adaptive immune system by recognizing and responding to antigens. Upon binding to a specific peptide presented by major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules, the TCR activates signaling pathways that lead to T cell activation, proliferation, and differentiation. Dysregulation of TCR signaling has been implicated in various autoimmune diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis and multiple sclerosis. Furthermore, the development of targeted therapies that modulate TCR signaling holds promise for the treatment of these autoimmune disorders. This review summarizes the current understanding of T cell receptor function, its role in disease pathogenesis, and the potential for targeting TCR signaling as a therapeutic strategy.
