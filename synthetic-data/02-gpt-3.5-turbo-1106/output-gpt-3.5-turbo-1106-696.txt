prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: yFACT. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we investigated the role of the yFACT protein complex in the context of prostate cancer progression. Our findings demonstrate a significant upregulation of yFACT expression in prostate cancer cell lines compared to healthy control cells. Furthermore, inhibition of yFACT activity using a novel small molecule inhibitor resulted in a marked attenuation of cell proliferation and a significant decrease in tumor growth in a mouse xenograft model. These results unveil yFACT as a promising therapeutic target for prostate cancer and highlight the potential of yFACT inhibitors in the treatment of this aggressive malignancy.
