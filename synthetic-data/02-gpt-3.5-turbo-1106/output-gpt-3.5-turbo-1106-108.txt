prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: PGH. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we investigated the role of the PGH protein complex in regulating inflammatory processes in a murine model of arthritis. We found that the PGH complex was significantly upregulated in the synovial tissue of arthritic joints compared to healthy controls. Furthermore, treatment with a small molecule inhibitor targeting the PGH complex resulted in a significant decrease in the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and a reduction in disease severity. Our findings highlight the potential of targeting the PGH complex as a therapeutic strategy for inflammatory joint diseases. This study sheds light on the intricate interplay of protein complexes in the pathogenesis of arthritis and points towards novel therapeutic targets for intervention.
