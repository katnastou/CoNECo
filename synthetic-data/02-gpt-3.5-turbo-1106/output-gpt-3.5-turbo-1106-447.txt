prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: complex III. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: Complex III, also known as the cytochrome bc1 complex, plays a crucial role in the electron transport chain during oxidative phosphorylation. This multi-subunit complex facilitates the transfer of electrons from ubiquinol to cytochrome c, generating a proton gradient across the inner mitochondrial membrane. Dysfunction of complex III has been implicated in various diseases, including mitochondrial disorders and cancer. Furthermore, chemical compounds targeting the activity of complex III have shown promise as potential therapeutic agents for conditions associated with mitochondrial dysfunction. Understanding the intricate regulatory mechanisms and structural organization of complex III is essential for elucidating its role in health and disease, as well as for developing novel interventions to modulate its function.
