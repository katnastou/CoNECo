prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: QFR. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The QFR protein complex has been shown to play a critical role in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's. Previous studies have indicated that the dysregulation of QFR is associated with an accumulation of amyloid-beta peptides in the brain, leading to the formation of toxic aggregates and neuronal dysfunction. In addition, aberrant interactions between QFR and reactive oxygen species have been implicated in the oxidative stress observed in Parkinson's disease. These findings highlight the potential of targeting QFR as a therapeutic strategy for mitigating the progression of neurodegenerative disorders. Further investigation into the molecular mechanisms underlying the involvement of QFR in disease pathology is warranted to fully elucidate its therapeutic potential.
