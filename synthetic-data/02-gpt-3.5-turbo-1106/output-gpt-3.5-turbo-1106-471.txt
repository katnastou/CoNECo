prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: VLA-4. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The VLA-4 protein complex has been implicated in the pathogenesis of multiple sclerosis (MS), a chronic inflammatory disease affecting the central nervous system. Previous studies have suggested a crucial role for VLA-4 in mediating the migration of leukocytes across the blood-brain barrier, amplifying neuroinflammation in the context of MS. Small molecule inhibitors targeting VLA-4 have shown promise in preclinical models of MS, highlighting the potential therapeutic value of modulating VLA-4 function. Additionally, the upregulation of VLA-4 expression on immune cells has been observed in patients with active MS lesions, further underscoring the relevance of VLA-4 in the disease process. Understanding the intricate involvement of VLA-4 in the pathophysiology of MS may yield novel therapeutic strategies for this debilitating condition.
