prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: DnaB hexamer. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The DnaB hexamer is a crucial component in the initiation of DNA replication in bacteria. Studies have shown that the interaction between the DnaB hexamer and the DNA helicase is essential for the unwinding of the double helix during the replication process. Mutations in the genes encoding the DnaB hexamer have been linked to increased susceptibility to certain bacterial infections, highlighting the importance of this protein complex in maintaining genomic stability. Furthermore, the development of small molecule inhibitors targeting the DnaB hexamer may hold promise as a novel therapeutic strategy for combating antibiotic-resistant bacterial infections. These findings underscore the significance of elucidating the mechanisms underlying the function and regulation of the DnaB hexamer in bacterial replication.
