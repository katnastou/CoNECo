prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: CPSase A. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: CPSase A is a key regulatory enzyme in the de novo biosynthesis of pyrimidines. This protein complex plays a crucial role in modulating the rate-limiting step of carbamoyl phosphate synthesis, which is essential for the production of pyrimidine nucleotides. The activity of CPSase A is tightly controlled through the allosteric regulation by end products of the pyrimidine biosynthetic pathway. Dysregulation of CPSase A has been implicated in several metabolic disorders, including orotic aciduria and other hereditary urea cycle defects. Inhibition of CPSase A activity has been investigated as a potential therapeutic strategy for the treatment of certain malignancies characterized by increased pyrimidine demand, such as certain types of cancer. Understanding the molecular mechanisms of CPSase A regulation and function is critical for the development of targeted therapies for diseases related to pyrimidine metabolism.
