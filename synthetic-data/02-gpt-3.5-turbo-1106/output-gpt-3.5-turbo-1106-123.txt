prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: Swm1/2. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we investigated the role of the Swm1/2 protein complex in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease. We utilized a mouse model of the disease and observed a significant decrease in dopamine levels in the striatum of mice with targeted deletion of the Swm1/2 complex. Additionally, we identified a novel small molecule inhibitor that specifically targets the ATP-binding site of the Swm1/2 complex and demonstrated its efficacy in preventing neurodegeneration in our mouse model. Our findings suggest that targeting the Swm1/2 complex may hold promise as a therapeutic strategy for treating Parkinson's disease and related dopaminergic disorders.
