prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: MSA. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In recent years, studies have elucidated the role of the MSA protein complex in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases. Research has demonstrated the interaction between MSA and amyloid-beta in the context of Alzheimer's disease, suggesting potential implications for disease progression and therapeutic targeting. Furthermore, investigations have highlighted the influence of MSA on the regulation of oxidative stress and inflammatory pathways in neurodegenerative disorders, implicating its involvement in disease mechanisms. These findings underscore the significance of further exploring the molecular mechanisms governing MSA function and its potential as a therapeutic target for neurodegenerative diseases.
