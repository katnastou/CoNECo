prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: MlaFEDB. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The MlaFEDB protein complex is a critical component involved in the outer membrane lipid transport and maintenance of membrane integrity in gram-negative bacteria. Disruption of MlaFEDB function has been linked to increased susceptibility to antimicrobial agents and alterations in cell envelope composition. Recent studies have shown that the MlaFEDB complex interacts with various phospholipids and lipopolysaccharides, thereby influencing the barrier properties of the outer membrane. Furthermore, dysregulation of MlaFEDB has been implicated in the development of multidrug resistance and increased virulence in pathogenic bacterial species. Understanding the precise molecular mechanisms underlying the function and regulation of MlaFEDB could have implications for the development of novel therapeutic strategies targeting bacterial membrane integrity.
