prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: KAR. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The X-47B inhibitor has been shown to significantly disrupt the function of the KAR protein complex in various cancer cell lines. In this study, we investigated the potential of X-47B as a therapeutic agent for KAR-related tumors. Our results demonstrate that treatment with X-47B resulted in a marked reduction in cell proliferation and the induction of apoptosis in KAR-overexpressing cancer cells. Furthermore, in vivo studies in xenograft mouse models revealed a significant regression in tumor size following X-47B treatment. Our findings support the potential of targeting the KAR protein complex using X-47B as a promising strategy for cancer therapy.
