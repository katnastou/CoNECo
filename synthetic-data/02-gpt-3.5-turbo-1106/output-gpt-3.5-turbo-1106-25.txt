prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: MCM core. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: Recent studies have implicated the MCM core as a key regulator in the initiation of DNA replication in eukaryotic cells. The MCM core complex is composed of six subunits and is essential for the formation of the pre-replicative complex (pre-RC). Dysregulation of the MCM core has been associated with various human diseases, including cancer, due to its crucial role in maintaining genomic stability. Furthermore, the discovery of small molecule inhibitors targeting the MCM core has opened up new avenues for therapeutic intervention in cancer and other proliferative disorders. Understanding the mechanisms of MCM core regulation and its potential as a therapeutic target holds promise for advancing treatment strategies for these diseases.
