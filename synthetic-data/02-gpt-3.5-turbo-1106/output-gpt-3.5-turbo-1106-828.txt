prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: ETF. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In recent research, the role of the electron transfer flavoprotein (ETF) in metabolic disorders such as fatty acid oxidation disorders has garnered increased attention. The ETF complex, consisting of ETF-alpha and ETF-beta subunits, plays a critical role in shuttling electrons from various flavoprotein dehydrogenases to the electron transport chain, thereby facilitating energy production. Defects in the ETF complex have been implicated in the pathogenesis of multiple acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiencies, leading to impaired fatty acid metabolism and subsequent accumulation of toxic intermediates. Moreover, the study of ETF-related metabolic diseases has important clinical implications for early diagnosis and therapeutic intervention, highlighting the significance of understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying ETF dysfunction in human health and disease.
