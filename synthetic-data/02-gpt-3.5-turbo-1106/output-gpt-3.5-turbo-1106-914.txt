prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: DSIF. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The transcriptional elongation factor DRB sensitivity-inducing factor (DSIF) has been implicated in the regulation of gene expression in various organisms, including humans. In particular, DSIF has been shown to interact with the positive transcription elongation factor b (P-TEFb) complex, playing a critical role in the control of RNA polymerase II elongation during the transcription process. Dysregulation of DSIF has been associated with various diseases, including cancer and infectious diseases, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target. Modulation of DSIF activity and its interaction with other transcriptional regulators may offer promising avenues for the development of novel treatments for a range of human diseases.
