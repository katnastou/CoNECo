prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: eukaryotic translation elongation factor 1. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we investigated the role of the eukaryotic translation elongation factor 1 (eEF1) in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease. We examined the interaction between eEF1 and amyloid beta peptides, the hallmark protein of Alzheimer's disease, in neuronal cells. Our results revealed that eEF1 directly binds to amyloid beta peptides, leading to impaired protein synthesis and the accumulation of neurotoxic proteins within the cell. Furthermore, we found that the dysregulation of eEF1 function exacerbates the synaptic dysfunction and cognitive decline observed in Alzheimer's disease. These findings suggest that targeting eEF1 signaling pathways may present a novel therapeutic strategy for mitigating the progression of Alzheimer's disease.
