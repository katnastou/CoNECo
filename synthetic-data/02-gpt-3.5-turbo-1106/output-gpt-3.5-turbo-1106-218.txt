prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: IL-10 receptor. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The interleukin-10 receptor (IL-10 receptor) has been implicated in various human diseases, such as inflammatory bowel disease, rheumatoid arthritis, and cancer. In this study, we investigated the role of IL-10 receptor in modulating the immune response in a murine model of colitis. Our results show that the binding of IL-10 to its receptor led to the attenuation of pro-inflammatory cytokine production and reduced tissue damage in the colon. Furthermore, we observed an upregulation of anti-inflammatory signaling pathways upon IL-10 receptor activation. These findings suggest that targeting the IL-10 receptor may hold therapeutic potential for the treatment of inflammatory diseases.
