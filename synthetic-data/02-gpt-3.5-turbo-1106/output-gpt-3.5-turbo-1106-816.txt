prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: HAUS augmin. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: Recent studies have shown that the HAUS augmin complex plays a crucial role in the regulation of microtubule networks during mitosis and cytokinesis in eukaryotic cells. The HAUS augmin complex is known to interact with Î³-tubulin and is essential for the proper assembly and function of the mitotic spindle. Dysregulation of the HAUS augmin complex has been implicated in various human diseases, including cancer and developmental disorders. Further research into the molecular mechanisms underlying the function of the HAUS augmin complex may provide valuable insights into potential therapeutic targets for diseases associated with aberrant cell division. Understanding the intricate interplay between the HAUS augmin complex and other regulatory proteins involved in cell division will pave the way for the development of novel treatment strategies for diseases characterized by abnormal mitotic processes.
