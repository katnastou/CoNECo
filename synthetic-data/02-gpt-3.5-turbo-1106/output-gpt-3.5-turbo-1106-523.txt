prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: NDC1. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The nuclear division cycle 1 (NDC1) protein complex plays a critical role in maintaining the integrity of the nuclear envelope in eukaryotic cells. This complex consists of multiple subunits that are essential for the proper localization and assembly of nuclear pore complexes (NPCs). Dysfunction of the NDC1 complex has been linked to the development of various human diseases, including genetic disorders and cancer. Recent studies have shown that the NDC1 complex interacts with specific lipid molecules within the nuclear membrane, highlighting the importance of lipid-protein interactions in nuclear envelope organization. Furthermore, the NDC1 complex has been implicated in the regulation of nuclear transport and the maintenance of genome stability. Understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying the function of the NDC1 complex is of great importance for the development of targeted therapies for diseases associated with nuclear envelope defects.
