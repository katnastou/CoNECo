prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: IL-28 receptor. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The IL-28 receptor is a key component in the signaling pathway associated with the antiviral response. Recent research has implicated the IL-28 receptor in the modulation of interferon gamma (IFN-Î³) signaling, highlighting its potential role in immune regulation. Studies have also suggested a link between the IL-28 receptor and the pathogenesis of hepatitis C virus infection, underscoring its importance in the context of viral diseases. Furthermore, investigations into the interaction between the IL-28 receptor and specific cytokines have revealed insights into the broader impact of this receptor on the inflammatory response. These findings contribute to a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying immune regulation and hold promise for the development of targeted therapies for infectious and inflammatory conditions.
