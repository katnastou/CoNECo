prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: Hpa3. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we investigated the role of the Hpa3 protein complex in the pathogenesis of Escherichia coli-induced urinary tract infections (UTIs). Our results revealed that the Hpa3 complex is upregulated in response to E. coli infection in a murine model of UTI, suggesting its involvement in the host immune response to bacterial invasion. Furthermore, we observed that chemical inhibition of Hpa3 complex activity resulted in exacerbation of UTI symptoms, indicating a potential protective role for this complex in the context of urinary tract infections. These findings provide important insights into the complex interplay between host factors and bacterial pathogens in the context of UTIs and highlight the potential of targeting the Hpa3 complex as a therapeutic strategy for UTI management.
