prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: cullin-RING ligase 2. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The cullin-RING ligase 2 (CRL2) is a multi-subunit ubiquitin ligase complex involved in the regulation of protein degradation and cell cycle control. Dysregulation of CRL2 has been associated with various human diseases, including cancer and neurodegenerative disorders. Studies have shown that CRL2 targets specific substrates for ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation, playing critical roles in maintaining cellular homeostasis. Furthermore, emerging evidence suggests that the pharmacological modulation of CRL2 activity may hold therapeutic potential for the treatment of certain diseases. Understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying the function of CRL2 is crucial for the development of targeted interventions aimed at restoring normal cellular function and preventing pathological progression.
