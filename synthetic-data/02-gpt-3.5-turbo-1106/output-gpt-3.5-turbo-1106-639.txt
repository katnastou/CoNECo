prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: transforming growth factor beta1-type II receptor-type I receptor. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The transforming growth factor beta1-type II receptor-type I receptor (TGF-β1-TβRI-TβRII) complex plays a pivotal role in the regulation of cellular processes implicated in numerous diseases, including cancer and fibrosis. Dysregulation of TGF-β signaling has been associated with pathogenesis of a wide array of disorders, such as pulmonary fibrosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. The intricate interaction between TGF-β ligands and the TGF-β1-TβRI-TβRII complex has been extensively studied, shedding light on potential therapeutic targets for conditions involving aberrant TGF-β signaling. Further investigations into the molecular mechanisms underlying the functional diversity of this complex may potentially unravel new avenues for drug development and therapeutic interventions in the treatment of TGF-β-related diseases.
