prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: Hydrogenase-2. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In recent years, there has been growing interest in studying the role of the Hydrogenase-2 protein complex in various physiological processes. Hydrogenase-2, a key enzyme involved in hydrogen metabolism, has been implicated in the pathogenesis of certain microbial infections. Previous studies have demonstrated that the activity of the Hydrogenase-2 complex is crucial for the survival and virulence of pathogenic bacteria in host organisms. Furthermore, the inhibition of Hydrogenase-2 has shown promising potential as a therapeutic strategy to combat bacterial infections. Understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying the function of Hydrogenase-2 in pathogenic organisms is of great significance for the development of novel antimicrobial agents. This research sheds light on the potential of targeting the Hydrogenase-2 complex as a promising avenue for the treatment of infectious diseases.
