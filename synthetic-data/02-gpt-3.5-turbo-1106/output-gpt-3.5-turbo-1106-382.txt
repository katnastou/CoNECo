prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: IL-23. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The IL-23 protein complex has been the subject of intensive investigation in the context of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Recent studies have shown that IL-23 plays a pivotal role in the modulation of the immune response and the development of IBD. The dysregulation of IL-23 has been associated with increased production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and disruption of mucosal barrier function in IBD patients. Furthermore, IL-23 has been implicated in the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis and psoriasis. Given its central role in these inflammatory processes, IL-23 represents a promising target for the development of novel therapeutic interventions for IBD and other autoimmune disorders.
