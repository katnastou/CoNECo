prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 (eIF2) is a critical component in the regulation of protein synthesis in eukaryotic cells. Dysregulation of eIF2 has been implicated in a variety of human diseases, including cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, and metabolic syndromes. Through its interaction with a range of kinases and phosphatases, eIF2 plays a central role in coordinating the cellular response to environmental stressors, such as nutrient deprivation, viral infection, and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. Furthermore, research has shown that eIF2 can influence the translation of specific mRNAs, thereby contributing to the regulation of gene expression in both health and disease. A better understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying eIF2 function may offer insights into potential therapeutic strategies for treating eIF2-related disorders.
