prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: Pol epsilon. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The study aimed to investigate the role of the Pol epsilon protein complex in the context of DNA replication fidelity and genome stability. Utilizing a combination of biochemical assays and genetic approaches, we observed a direct interaction between Pol epsilon and the DNA repair machinery in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Furthermore, we found that a deficiency in Pol epsilon function led to an increased frequency of replication errors and a higher susceptibility to DNA damage. These findings have important implications for understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying the development of cancer and neurodegenerative diseases, as well as for the potential development of novel therapeutic strategies targeting genome maintenance pathways.
