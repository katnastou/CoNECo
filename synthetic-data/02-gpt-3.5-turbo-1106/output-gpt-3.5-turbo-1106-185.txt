prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: Cystine/glutamate antiporter system xc. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The Cystine/glutamate antiporter system xc plays a critical role in the regulation of oxidative stress and inflammation in various pathological conditions. Recent studies have highlighted its involvement in the modulation of cellular redox status and immune responses. Dysregulation of system xc activity has been implicated in neurodegenerative disorders, such as Parkinson's disease, and psychiatric disorders, such as schizophrenia. Moreover, the dysregulated function of system xc has been associated with the etiology of certain types of cancer. Understanding the mechanisms that govern the activity of system xc may offer novel therapeutic targets for the management of oxidative stress-related diseases and immune-mediated disorders. Further research elucidating the molecular intricacies of system xc function is warranted to develop targeted interventions for these diverse pathophysiological conditions.
