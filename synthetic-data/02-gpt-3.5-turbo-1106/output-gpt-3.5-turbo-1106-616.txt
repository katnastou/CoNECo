prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: PDHC. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDHC) plays a critical role in connecting glycolysis and the citric acid cycle by catalyzing the conversion of pyruvate to acetyl-CoA. Dysregulation of PDHC activity has been implicated in metabolic disorders such as diabetes and heart disease. Recent studies have identified potential regulators of PDHC activity, including phosphorylation and acetylation of the E1 and E2 subunits. Additionally, small molecules targeting PDHC have shown promising effects in preclinical models of metabolic diseases. Understanding the regulation and therapeutic potential of PDHC may uncover new strategies for treating metabolic disorders and related conditions.
