prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: Snf1 kinase. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we investigated the role of the Snf1 kinase complex in cellular energy homeostasis. Our findings demonstrate that the Snf1 kinase complex plays a crucial role in the regulation of glucose metabolism in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Through a series of biochemical and genetic analyses, we show that the Snf1 kinase complex acts as a molecular switch, governing the transition between glycolysis and gluconeogenesis in response to cellular energy status. Furthermore, our results indicate that dysregulation of the Snf1 kinase complex is associated with impaired glucose tolerance and insulin resistance in a murine model of type 2 diabetes. These findings highlight the potential therapeutic relevance of targeting the Snf1 kinase complex in the treatment of metabolic disorders.
