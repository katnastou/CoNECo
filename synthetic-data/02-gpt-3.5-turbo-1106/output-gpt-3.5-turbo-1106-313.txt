prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: CKII. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The CKII protein complex has been implicated in the regulation of cellular processes across various organisms. Studies have shown that CKII plays a role in cancer progression, as its dysregulation has been linked to the development and progression of various malignancies. Furthermore, CKII has been suggested to have a regulatory role in neurodegenerative diseases, such as Parkinson's and Alzheimer's. Moreover, CKII has been shown to interact with certain chemicals involved in intracellular signaling pathways, highlighting its potential as a target for pharmacological intervention. This emerging understanding of the diverse roles of the CKII protein complex underscores the importance of further investigation into its potential as a therapeutic target for various diseases.
