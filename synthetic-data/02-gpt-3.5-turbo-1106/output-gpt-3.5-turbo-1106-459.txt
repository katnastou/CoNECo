prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: CoaC. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: Recent studies have explored the role of the CoaC protein complex in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease. The interaction between CoaC and certain chemical modulators has been found to influence the aggregation of misfolded proteins, a hallmark feature of neurodegenerative disorders. Furthermore, investigation into the effects of CoaC on the biological pathways involved in neuroinflammation and oxidative stress has revealed potential links to disease progression. These findings suggest that targeting the CoaC complex may provide new therapeutic opportunities for the treatment of neurodegenerative conditions. Additionally, the impact of CoaC on the immune response and its potential association with autoimmune diseases warrant further investigation. Overall, the emerging role of CoaC in the pathophysiology of neurodegenerative and autoimmune diseases presents an exciting area for future research and therapeutic development.
