prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: Lutropin. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The role of the Lutropin protein complex in the regulation of reproductive function has been the subject of significant research interest in recent years. Lutropin, also known as luteinizing hormone, is a glycoprotein hormone primarily produced by the anterior pituitary gland. Its interaction with the Lutropin receptor on ovarian and testicular cells plays a critical role in the regulation of gonadal function, including steroidogenesis, ovulation, and spermatogenesis. Dysregulation of the Lutropin complex has been implicated in a variety of reproductive disorders, including polycystic ovary syndrome, hypogonadism, and infertility. Understanding the mechanisms underlying Lutropin signaling and its interactions with other regulatory pathways may provide valuable insights into the development of novel therapeutic interventions for these conditions.
