prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: PreaT. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we investigated the role of the protein complex PreaT in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease. We utilized transgenic mouse models overexpressing the amyloid precursor protein to demonstrate the interaction between PreaT and beta-amyloid, the hallmark protein of Alzheimer's disease pathology. We further explored the effect of small molecule inhibitors targeting PreaT in mitigating the cognitive decline associated with amyloid plaque deposition. Our findings suggest that modulation of PreaT activity could represent a promising therapeutic strategy for alleviating the neurotoxic effects of beta-amyloid in Alzheimer's disease.
