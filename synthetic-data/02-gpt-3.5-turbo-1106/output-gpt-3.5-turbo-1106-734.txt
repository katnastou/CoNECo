prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: elongin. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: Recent studies have implicated the elongin protein complex in the pathogenesis of multiple myeloma, a hematological malignancy characterized by abnormal plasma cell proliferation in bone marrow. The dysregulation of elongin has been shown to play a key role in the disruption of critical cellular pathways, leading to uncontrolled cell growth and survival. Furthermore, experimental evidence suggests that the overexpression of certain microRNAs may directly influence the activity of elongin, highlighting the complex interplay between non-coding RNAs and protein complexes in cancer development. These findings underscore the potential of targeting elongin as a therapeutic strategy for combating multiple myeloma, offering promising avenues for the development of precision medicine approaches in the treatment of hematologic malignancies.
