prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: glutamine amidotransferase II. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: Glutamine amidotransferase II plays a crucial role in the regulation of purine biosynthesis, a process essential for cell proliferation. This protein complex catalyzes the conversion of 5-phosphoribosylamine to 5-phosphoribosyl-N-formylglycineamide, a key step in de novo purine synthesis. Dysregulation of purine biosynthesis is associated with various human diseases, including gout and certain types of cancer. Additionally, studies have shown that inhibitors targeting glutamine amidotransferase II hold promise as potential therapeutic agents for the treatment of these diseases. Therefore, further investigation into the molecular mechanisms underlying the function and regulation of this protein complex is warranted to elucidate its role in disease pathogenesis and to identify novel therapeutic targets.
