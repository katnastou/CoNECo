prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: surface IgA. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The role of the surface IgA protein complex in gastrointestinal immune regulation is critical for maintaining homeostasis and protection against pathogens. It has been shown that secretory IgA plays a key role in providing mucosal immunity in the gut, as evidenced by its association with infectious diarrhea and inflammatory bowel disease. The heterotrimeric structure of the surface IgA complex allows for specific recognition and neutralization of antigens, and its interaction with the gut microbiota also contributes to the maintenance of intestinal barrier function. Understanding the function and regulation of surface IgA may provide insights into therapeutic strategies for managing gut-related diseases and dysbiosis.
