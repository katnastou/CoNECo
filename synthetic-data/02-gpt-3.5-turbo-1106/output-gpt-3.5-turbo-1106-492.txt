prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: Kir6.1-SUR. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The ATP-sensitive potassium channel (KATP) is an important regulator of insulin secretion and glucose homeostasis. The channel is composed of two main subunits, Kir6.1 and the sulfonylurea receptor (SUR). The Kir6.1-SUR complex plays a crucial role in coupling cellular metabolism to insulin secretion. Mutations in the Kir6.1-SUR complex have been implicated in various diseases, including neonatal diabetes and congenital hyperinsulinism. Additionally, pharmacological modulators of the Kir6.1-SUR complex have been investigated as potential therapeutic targets for diabetes and other metabolic disorders. Understanding the structure and function of the Kir6.1-SUR complex is essential for the development of novel treatments for these diseases.
