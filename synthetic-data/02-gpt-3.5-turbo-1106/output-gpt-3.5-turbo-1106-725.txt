prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: HOPS. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The HOPS protein complex in yeast is a key player in vesicular trafficking, regulating the transport of cargo between different organelles within the cell. Disruption of HOPS function has been linked to various cellular defects, including impaired endosomal maturation and vacuolar protein sorting. Recent studies have also implicated HOPS in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases, such as Parkinson's disease, highlighting its potential significance in human health. Furthermore, small molecule inhibitors targeting the HOPS complex have shown promise as potential therapeutic agents for treating certain infectious diseases by disrupting the intracellular trafficking of pathogens. Understanding the regulatory mechanisms and functional significance of HOPS in cellular processes may offer new insights into the development of novel therapeutic strategies for a range of human diseases.
