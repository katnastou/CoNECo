prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: polycystin. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we investigated the role of polycystin in the development of kidney cysts in a model of autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD). Through immunofluorescence and co-immunoprecipitation assays, we demonstrated the interaction between polycystin and calcium signaling proteins in renal epithelial cells. Moreover, our findings suggest that dysregulation of polycystin function leads to abnormal calcium influx, resulting in the activation of the mTOR pathway and subsequent cell proliferation. Furthermore, treatment with a specific inhibitor of mTOR signaling attenuated cyst formation in a mouse model of ADPKD. Our results provide insights into the mechanistic role of polycystin and offer potential therapeutic targets for the treatment of polycystic kidney disease.
