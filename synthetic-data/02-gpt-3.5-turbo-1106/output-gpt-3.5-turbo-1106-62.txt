prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: positive transcription elongation factor complex b. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In recent years, there has been growing interest in the role of the positive transcription elongation factor complex b (P-TEFb) in various disease states. Previous studies have implicated P-TEFb in the pathogenesis of several cancers, including breast cancer and leukemia. More recently, researchers have also explored the potential involvement of P-TEFb in the development of neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease. Furthermore, emerging evidence suggests that dysregulation of P-TEFb activity may be linked to metabolic disorders, including diabetes and obesity. Given the diverse range of diseases with potential P-TEFb involvement, further investigation into the molecular mechanisms underlying P-TEFb function and dysregulation is warranted, offering opportunities for the development of novel therapeutic interventions.
