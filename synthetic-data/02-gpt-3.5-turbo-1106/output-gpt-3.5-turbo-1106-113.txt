prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: energy coupling factor (ECF)-type ABC transporter. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we investigated the role of the energy coupling factor (ECF)-type ABC transporter in the pathogenesis of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB). We examined the impact of ECF-type ABC transporter expression on the efflux of antimicrobial agents in Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the causative agent of TB. Our findings reveal a correlation between overexpression of the ECF-type ABC transporter and increased resistance to multiple antibiotics, leading to a higher prevalence of MDR-TB. These results highlight the potential of targeting the ECF-type ABC transporter as a novel therapeutic strategy for combating drug-resistant TB.
