prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: mitofilin. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The role of mitofilin in mitochondrial function and human disease has been the subject of intense research in recent years. Mitofilin is a crucial component of the mitochondrial inner membrane organizing system, essential for the maintenance of mitochondrial structure and function. Dysfunction of mitofilin has been linked to various human diseases, including mitochondrial myopathy, neuropathy, and cardiomyopathy. Furthermore, studies have demonstrated the association of mitofilin with cellular apoptosis and oxidative stress responses. In addition, the role of mitofilin in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's and Alzheimer's has garnered attention, raising the possibility of targeting mitofilin as a potential therapeutic strategy for these conditions. These findings underline the importance of further investigating the impact of mitofilin in mitochondrial biology and human health.
