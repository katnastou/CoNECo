prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: membrane-bound IgA1. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we investigated the role of the membrane-bound IgA1 protein complex in the pathogenesis of IgA nephropathy, a common form of glomerulonephritis characterized by the deposition of IgA antibodies in the renal glomeruli. Our analysis revealed a significant upregulation of membrane-bound IgA1 in renal biopsy specimens from patients with IgA nephropathy compared to healthy controls. Furthermore, we observed a positive correlation between the expression levels of membrane-bound IgA1 and the severity of renal lesions in affected individuals. Our findings suggest that membrane-bound IgA1 may play a pivotal role in the development and progression of IgA nephropathy, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target for this chronic renal disease.
