prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: CRL3. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The CRL3 protein complex has been implicated in the regulation of various cellular processes, including cell cycle control, DNA damage response, and signal transduction. Recent studies have revealed a potential role for CRL3 in the development of certain types of cancer, such as hepatocellular carcinoma and pancreatic adenocarcinoma. Additionally, CRL3 has been shown to interact with certain small molecules and pharmacological agents, suggesting its potential as a target for drug development. Further investigations into the mechanisms of action and regulatory pathways of CRL3 may provide valuable insights into the pathogenesis of cancer and potential therapeutic interventions.
