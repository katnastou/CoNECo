prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: SUN-KASH. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: Recent studies have shed light on the critical role of the SUN-KASH protein complex in maintaining nuclear envelope integrity and regulating nuclear positioning. The SUN-KASH complex is conserved across various organisms and is involved in mediating the connection between the nuclear envelope and the cytoskeleton. Disruption of this complex has been implicated in a range of diseases, including muscular dystrophies and Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy. Furthermore, the dysregulation of SUN-KASH has been associated with defects in cellular migration and mechanotransduction, highlighting its significance in development and tissue homeostasis. Understanding the functional significance of the SUN-KASH complex may offer insights into the pathogenesis of various diseases and guide the development of novel therapeutic strategies targeting this critical molecular interface.
