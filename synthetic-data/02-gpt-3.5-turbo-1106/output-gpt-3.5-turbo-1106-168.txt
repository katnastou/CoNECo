prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: AHRC. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The AHRC protein complex has been implicated in the regulation of cellular homeostasis and the response to oxidative stress in human cells. Recent studies have demonstrated that AHRC interacts with key transcription factors involved in the activation of antioxidant response elements, playing a critical role in the maintenance of cellular redox balance. Furthermore, dysregulation of AHRC has been associated with increased susceptibility to oxidative damage and the development of neurodegenerative disorders such as Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease. Given its important role in cellular defense mechanisms, targeting the AHRC complex may hold therapeutic potential for mitigating oxidative stress-related pathologies. Understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying AHRC function could provide valuable insights into the development of targeted interventions for oxidative stress-related disorders.
