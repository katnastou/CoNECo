prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: FA core. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The FA core is a crucial protein complex implicated in the pathogenesis of Fanconi anemia, a rare genetic disorder characterized by bone marrow failure, developmental abnormalities, and an increased risk of cancer. Recent studies have revealed the potential role of small molecule inhibitors targeting key participants of the FA core in sensitizing cancer cells to DNA-damaging agents, providing a promising strategy for enhancing the efficacy of chemotherapy in various malignancies. Furthermore, dysregulation of the FA core has been associated with increased genomic instability and impaired DNA repair, highlighting its significance in maintaining genome integrity and cellular homeostasis. These findings underscore the potential of targeting the FA core as a therapeutic approach for Fanconi anemia and cancer treatment.
