prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: NAD(P)H-dependent FMN reductase. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we sought to investigate the role of the NAD(P)H-dependent FMN reductase in oxidative stress-related neurodegenerative diseases. Using a murine model of Parkinson's disease, we observed a significant upregulation of NAD(P)H-dependent FMN reductase expression in the substantia nigra, a brain region known to be affected in Parkinson's disease. Furthermore, we identified a novel small molecule inhibitor of NAD(P)H-dependent FMN reductase, which exhibited potent neuroprotective effects in vitro and in vivo. Our findings suggest that targeting NAD(P)H-dependent FMN reductase may represent a promising therapeutic approach for the treatment of Parkinson's disease and other oxidative stress-related neurodegenerative disorders.
