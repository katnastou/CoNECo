prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: SAS-I. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The SAS-I protein complex has been implicated in the regulation of chromatin structure and gene expression in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Previous studies have shown that the SAS-I complex is essential for maintaining proper chromatin organization and for the acetylation of histone proteins. Additionally, the SAS-I complex has been associated with the development of certain neurological disorders, suggesting a potential role in disease pathogenesis. Despite its importance, the precise mechanisms by which the SAS-I complex functions in these processes remain poorly understood. Further investigation into the interactions and functions of the SAS-I complex may provide valuable insights into its role in gene regulation and its potential implications for disease pathology.
