prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: cullin. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In recent years, there has been growing interest in the role of the cullin protein complex in cancer development and progression. The cullin complex is a crucial component of the ubiquitin-proteasome system, which regulates the degradation of key proteins involved in cell cycle control and signaling pathways. Dysfunction of the cullin complex has been implicated in the pathogenesis of various malignancies, including breast, lung, and colorectal cancer. Furthermore, studies have shown that aberrant activation of the cullin complex is associated with increased tumor growth and metastasis. Targeting the cullin complex and its associated regulatory pathways may therefore represent a promising therapeutic strategy for cancer treatment. Further investigation into the precise mechanisms underlying cullin complex dysregulation and its impact on tumorigenesis is warranted to uncover potential therapeutic targets for cancer therapy.
