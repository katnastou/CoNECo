prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: surface IgE. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: Surface IgE, an essential protein complex involved in the immune response, plays a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of allergic diseases such as asthma and atopic dermatitis. Our study investigated the binding specificity of surface IgE in the context of allergic sensitization to environmental allergens. Utilizing a murine model, we observed a marked increase in surface IgE expression in response to allergen exposure, indicating a potential link between environmental triggers and the upregulation of surface IgE. Furthermore, we examined the impact of pharmacological interventions on surface IgE levels, with promising results suggesting that targeting this protein complex may offer novel therapeutic opportunities for the management of allergic conditions. These findings shed light on the intricate interplay between surface IgE and allergen-induced immune responses, paving the way for further exploration of its potential as a therapeutic target in allergic diseases.
