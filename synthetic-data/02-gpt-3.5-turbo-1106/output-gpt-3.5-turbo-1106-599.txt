prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: Adapter complex AP-2. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we investigated the role of the Adapter complex AP-2 in the internalization of transferrin receptor in human cells. We found that depletion of Adapter complex AP-2 resulted in a significant decrease in the internalization of transferrin receptor, suggesting a crucial role of Adapter complex AP-2 in this process. Furthermore, we observed that the treatment with chlorpromazine, a known inhibitor of clathrin-mediated endocytosis, also led to reduced levels of transferrin receptor internalization, indicating the involvement of Adapter complex AP-2 in this pathway. Our findings provide new insights into the mechanisms underlying the endocytic pathway and highlight the importance of Adapter complex AP-2 in regulating cellular processes related to transferrin receptor trafficking.
