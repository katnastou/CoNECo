prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: laminin-332. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: Laminin-332 is a basement membrane glycoprotein complex found in the extracellular matrix of various tissues, where it plays essential roles in cell adhesion, migration, and tissue organization. Dysregulation of laminin-332 expression has been implicated in the pathogenesis of various diseases, including certain forms of cancer and skin diseases. Recent studies have highlighted the involvement of laminin-332 in the regulation of epithelial cell polarity and tissue morphogenesis, providing potential insights into its contributions to developmental processes and disease progression. Elucidating the molecular pathways and interactions involving laminin-332 may lead to novel therapeutic strategies targeting diseases associated with aberrant basement membrane composition and function.
