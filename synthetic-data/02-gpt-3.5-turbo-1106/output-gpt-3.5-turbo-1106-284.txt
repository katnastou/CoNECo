prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: mitochondrial ribonuclease P. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we investigated the potential role of mitochondrial ribonuclease P (mtRNase P) in the pathogenesis of mitochondrial disorders. Through targeted molecular and cellular approaches, we observed that dysregulation of mtRNase P activity led to aberrant processing of mitochondrial tRNAs, resulting in impaired mitochondrial protein synthesis and energy production. Furthermore, we found that mutations in the gene encoding the RNA subunit of mtRNase P were associated with a spectrum of mitochondrial diseases, such as mitochondrial encephalomyopathy with lactic acidosis and stroke-like episodes (MELAS) and myoclonic epilepsy with ragged-red fibers (MERRF). Our findings suggest that mtRNase P dysfunction contributes to the pathophysiology of mitochondrial disorders and may represent a potential therapeutic target for this class of diseases.
