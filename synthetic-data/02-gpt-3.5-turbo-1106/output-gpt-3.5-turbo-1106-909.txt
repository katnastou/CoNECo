prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: TXT. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The transcription export (TXT) protein complex has been implicated in the regulation of gene expression through its interaction with various RNA species. In a recent study, the role of the TXT complex in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease was explored. It was found that dysregulation of the TXT complex led to impaired RNA export, resulting in accumulation of toxic RNA species in neuronal cells. Additionally, chemical inhibitors targeting the function of the TXT complex were shown to alleviate neurodegenerative symptoms in an animal model of Parkinson's disease. These findings suggest that targeting the TXT complex may offer a potential therapeutic strategy for treating Parkinson's disease and other neurodegenerative disorders associated with RNA dysregulation.
