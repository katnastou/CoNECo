prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: cysND. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The cysND protein complex plays a crucial role in the pathogenesis of tuberculosis, a chronic infectious disease caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Recent studies have demonstrated the involvement of cysND in the oxidative stress response within the bacterial cell, leading to increased survival and persistence of the pathogen in the host. Furthermore, cysND has been identified as a potential target for novel drug development strategies aimed at combating drug-resistant strains of tuberculosis. Understanding the structure and function of the cysND complex is therefore essential for the design of effective therapeutic interventions targeting this critical pathway in the infectious cycle of M. tuberculosis.
