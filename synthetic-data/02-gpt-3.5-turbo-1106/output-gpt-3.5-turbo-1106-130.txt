prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: ADPG pyrophosphorylase. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The ADPG pyrophosphorylase (ADPG-P) protein complex plays a crucial role in carbohydrate metabolism, specifically in the synthesis of starch in plants and glycogen in animals. This enzyme catalyzes the conversion of glucose-1-phosphate and ATP to ADP-glucose and pyrophosphate, a reaction essential for the production of storage polysaccharides. Mutations in the genes encoding ADPG-P have been associated with metabolic disorders such as glycogen storage diseases, highlighting the significance of this protein complex in human health. Furthermore, inhibitors targeting ADPG-P have shown promise as potential therapeutic agents for conditions characterized by dysregulated glycogen metabolism, making this enzyme an attractive target for drug development. Further research into the structure and function of ADPG-P may provide valuable insights into potential strategies for managing and treating these metabolic disorders.
