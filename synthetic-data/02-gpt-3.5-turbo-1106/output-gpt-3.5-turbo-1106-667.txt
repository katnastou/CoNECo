prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: alpha4-beta1 integrin. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The alpha4-beta1 integrin protein complex has been implicated in numerous pathological processes, including inflammation and metastatic spread of cancer. In a recent study, the role of alpha4-beta1 integrin in mediating T cell migration to inflammatory sites was investigated. Results indicated that blocking the interaction between alpha4-beta1 integrin and its ligand inhibited T cell recruitment to inflamed tissues, suggesting a potential therapeutic target for inflammatory diseases. Furthermore, the association between alpha4-beta1 integrin and cancer metastasis was explored, revealing a significant enhancement of tumor cell adhesion and invasion in the presence of this protein complex. These findings highlight the diverse implications of alpha4-beta1 integrin in disease progression and underscore its potential as a therapeutic target in multiple pathological conditions.
