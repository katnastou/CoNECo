prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: gamma-secretases. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: Recent studies have provided substantial evidence implicating the gamma-secretases in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease, a devastating neurodegenerative disorder characterized by cognitive decline and memory loss. The dysregulation of this protein complex has been linked to the aberrant processing of amyloid precursor protein, resulting in the accumulation of amyloid-β peptides in the brain, a hallmark feature of Alzheimer's disease pathology. Inhibition of gamma-secretases has emerged as a potential therapeutic strategy to mitigate amyloid-β peptide production and diminish disease progression. However, the complexity of the proteolytic activities of gamma-secretases and their involvement in diverse physiological processes necessitates comprehensive investigations to fully elucidate their roles in health and disease. These efforts hold promise for the development of targeted interventions for Alzheimer's disease and related neurodegenerative conditions.
