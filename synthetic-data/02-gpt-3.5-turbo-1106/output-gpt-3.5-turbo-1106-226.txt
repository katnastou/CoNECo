prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: brahma. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The brahma protein complex has been implicated in various cellular processes, including chromatin remodeling and transcriptional regulation. Its role in modulating gene expression has important implications in cancer biology. Previous studies have shown that alterations in the activity of the brahma complex are associated with tumorigenesis and metastasis in diverse cancer types. Furthermore, the dysregulation of brahma complex function has been linked to the development of drug resistance and poor clinical outcomes in cancer patients. Understanding the interactions and regulatory mechanisms of the brahma complex may lead to the development of novel therapeutic strategies for cancer treatment. Hence, further investigation into the molecular pathways involving the brahma complex is crucial for identifying potential targets for cancer therapy.
