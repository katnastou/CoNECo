prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: electron transport complex III. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The electron transport complex III, also known as cytochrome bc1 complex, is a crucial component of the mitochondrial respiratory chain, playing a vital role in the process of oxidative phosphorylation. This complex is responsible for the transfer of electrons from ubiquinol to cytochrome c, which generates a proton gradient across the inner mitochondrial membrane. Dysfunction of electron transport complex III has been implicated in various pathophysiological conditions, including mitochondrial diseases and neurodegenerative disorders. In particular, mutations in genes encoding subunits of this complex have been associated with conditions such as Leigh syndrome and mitochondrial encephalomyopathy. Understanding the structure and function of electron transport complex III is essential for developing targeted therapies to mitigate the impact of its dysfunction on human health.
