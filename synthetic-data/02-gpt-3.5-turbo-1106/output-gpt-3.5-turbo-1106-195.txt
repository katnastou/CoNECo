prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: 5FMC. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The role of the 5FMC protein complex in the pathogenesis of colorectal cancer has been a subject of great interest in recent years. Researchers have investigated the interaction between 5FMC and key signaling pathways involved in tumorigenesis, such as the MAPK and PI3K/Akt pathways. Additionally, the dysregulation of 5FMC expression has been found to correlate with the progression and metastasis of colorectal cancer in clinical studies. Furthermore, studies have shown that targeting the 5FMC complex with small molecule inhibitors can suppress tumor growth and metastatic potential in preclinical models. These findings highlight the potential of 5FMC as a therapeutic target for colorectal cancer and warrant further investigation into its molecular mechanisms and clinical implications.
