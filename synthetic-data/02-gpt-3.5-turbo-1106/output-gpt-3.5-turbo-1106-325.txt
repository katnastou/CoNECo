prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: DPNH-coenzyme Q reductase. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we investigated the interaction between DPNH-coenzyme Q reductase and oxidative stress in the context of Parkinson's disease. We examined the effect of the chemical compound rotenone on the activity of DPNH-coenzyme Q reductase in cellular models of Parkinson's disease. Our results show that rotenone treatment led to a significant decrease in the activity of DPNH-coenzyme Q reductase, indicating a potential association between the dysfunction of this protein complex and the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease. Further elucidation of the specific molecular mechanisms underlying this interaction could offer valuable insights into the development of potential therapeutic strategies for Parkinson's disease.
