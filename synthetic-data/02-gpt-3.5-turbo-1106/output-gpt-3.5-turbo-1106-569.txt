prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: C3PO. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The C3PO protein complex has been shown to play a critical role in the regulation of immune responses. In a study conducted on mouse models of rheumatoid arthritis, researchers observed a significant increase in disease severity in C3PO-deficient mice compared to wild-type controls. Interestingly, treatment with a small molecule inhibitor targeting the enzymatic activity of C3PO resulted in reduced inflammation and joint damage in the arthritic mice. Further investigation revealed that C3PO inhibition led to a decrease in the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and a shift towards a more anti-inflammatory immune profile. These findings suggest that targeting C3PO may hold therapeutic potential for the treatment of autoimmune diseases like rheumatoid arthritis.
