prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: HEX S. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we investigated the role of the HEX S protein complex in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease. Our results demonstrate a significant upregulation of HEX S in post-mortem brain tissues from Alzheimer's disease patients compared to healthy controls. Furthermore, we observed a positive correlation between the level of HEX S expression and the severity of cognitive impairment in a cohort of Alzheimer's disease patients. Mechanistic experiments revealed that inhibition of HEX S activity using a small molecule inhibitor attenuated the neurotoxic effects of amyloid-beta peptides in cellular and animal models. These findings highlight the potential of targeting HEX S as a therapeutic strategy for Alzheimer's disease.
