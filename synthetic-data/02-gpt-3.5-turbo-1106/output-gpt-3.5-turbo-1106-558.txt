prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: CeBCD. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we investigated the role of CeBCD in the regulation of iron metabolism in Caenorhabditis elegans. We observed that inhibition of CeBCD activity led to a significant decrease in iron uptake and storage in the nematodes. Furthermore, our findings demonstrated that CeBCD plays a crucial role in the maintenance of iron homeostasis within the organism. Notably, dysregulation of CeBCD activity was associated with increased susceptibility to iron-related disorders, such as anemia and iron overload. Our study highlights the importance of CeBCD in the modulation of iron levels in C. elegans and provides valuable insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying iron metabolism in this model organism.
