prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: EARP. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we investigated the role of the Endosome-Associated Recycling Protein (EARP) complex in the pathogenesis of familial hypercholesterolemia. By utilizing a combination of in vitro cellular assays and in vivo transgenic animal models, we demonstrated a critical link between EARP and the regulation of low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) recycling in hepatocytes. Our findings suggest that dysregulation of EARP function may contribute to the impaired clearance of circulating LDL cholesterol, thereby exacerbating atherogenesis and increasing the risk of cardiovascular events in affected individuals. These insights shed light on the potential therapeutic significance of targeting EARP-mediated pathways in the treatment of familial hypercholesterolemia and associated cardiovascular complications.
