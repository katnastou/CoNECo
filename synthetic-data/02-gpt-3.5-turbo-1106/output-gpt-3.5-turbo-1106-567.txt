prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: SWI-SNF. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we investigated the role of the SWI-SNF protein complex in the pathogenesis of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). We hypothesized that dysregulation of the SWI-SNF complex might contribute to aberrant chromatin remodeling and gene expression patterns, thereby leading to leukemogenesis. To test this hypothesis, we utilized a murine model of ALL and performed RNA sequencing to assess the transcriptomic effects of SWI-SNF perturbation. Our results demonstrated significant alterations in gene expression profiles, particularly those related to cell cycle regulation and differentiation. Furthermore, we observed that chemical inhibitors targeting SWI-SNF components were able to impair leukemia cell proliferation and induce differentiation. These findings provide important insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying ALL and suggest that targeting the SWI-SNF complex may represent a promising therapeutic strategy for this disease.
