prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: MPF. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we investigated the role of the MPF protein complex in the regulation of cell cycle progression in ovarian cancer cells. Our findings demonstrate a significant upregulation of MPF expression in cancerous tissues compared to normal ovarian tissues, suggesting a potential association of MPF with ovarian cancer pathogenesis. Furthermore, we observed that treatment with a specific inhibitor of MPF led to a dose-dependent decrease in cell proliferation and an increase in apoptosis in ovarian cancer cell lines. These results imply that targeting MPF may hold promise as a therapeutic strategy for the management of ovarian cancer. Overall, our study highlights the potential of MPF as a novel molecular target for the development of targeted therapies against ovarian cancer.
