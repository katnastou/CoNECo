prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: PAF1C. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In recent years, much attention has been directed towards understanding the role of the PAF1C protein complex in the pathogenesis of cancer. The PAF1C complex has been implicated in the regulation of gene expression, and its dysregulation has been linked to the development and progression of various malignancies. Studies have shown that disruption of the PAF1C complex can lead to abnormal transcriptional elongation, resulting in aberrant expression of critical oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes. Furthermore, aberrant PAF1C function has been associated with increased cell proliferation and metastatic potential in several cancer types. Therefore, targeting the PAF1C complex may hold promise as a therapeutic strategy for cancer treatment. Further investigation into the molecular mechanisms underlying the dysregulation of the PAF1C complex in cancer is warranted to fully elucidate its potential as a target for novel anticancer therapies.
