prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: SSR. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we investigated the potential interaction between SSR and the pathogenesis of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Our findings demonstrate that the downregulation of SSR is associated with the overactivation of microglia and the subsequent neuroinflammation, leading to the progression of ALS in a mouse model. Additionally, we observed a significant increase in the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines in the spinal cord tissues of SSR-deficient mice. Moreover, upon the administration of a specific small molecule agonist targeting SSR, we observed a marked attenuation of ALS-associated motor deficits, suggesting a potential therapeutic strategy for ALS by modulating the activity of SSR. Our results provide novel insights into the role of SSR in neuroinflammation and offer promising avenues for the development of targeted therapies for ALS.
