prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: CK2. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The protein complex CK2, also known as casein kinase 2, plays a crucial role in the regulation of various cellular processes. CK2 is associated with the phosphorylation of a wide range of substrates, impacting cell signaling, gene expression, and cell cycle progression. Dysregulation of CK2 has been implicated in numerous diseases, including cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, and inflammatory conditions. The complex is known to interact with various chemical compounds, either as activators or inhibitors, and has been extensively studied in model organisms such as mice and Caenorhabditis elegans. Targeting CK2 for therapeutic interventions has shown promising results in preclinical studies, making it a potential drug target for various human diseases. Understanding the intricate regulatory mechanisms and functional significance of CK2 is critical for developing novel therapeutic strategies and improving clinical outcomes.
