prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: Biotin-dependent acetyl-coenzyme A carboxylase. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we investigated the role of Biotin-dependent acetyl-coenzyme A carboxylase (Biotin-ACC) in the development of obesity-related metabolic disorders. Using a murine model, we observed that Biotin-ACC activity was significantly altered in adipose tissue of diet-induced obese mice compared to controls. Furthermore, perturbations in the Biotin-ACC complex were associated with dysregulation of fatty acid metabolism and increased lipogenesis in the obese phenotype. Our findings suggest a potential link between Biotin-ACC and metabolic disturbances in obesity, shedding light on the complex interplay between Biotin-ACC and adipose tissue function in the context of metabolic disease. These findings may have implications for the development of novel therapeutic strategies targeting the Biotin-ACC complex to mitigate the impact of obesity-related metabolic complications.
