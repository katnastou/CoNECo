prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: MetNI transporter. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The MetNI transporter is a well-characterized protein complex in bacteria responsible for the uptake of methionine and its derivative, selenomethionine, into the cells. Previous studies have shown that the MetNI transporter is crucial for the survival and virulence of pathogenic bacteria, making it an attractive target for novel antimicrobial therapies. In recent years, the molecular structure and function of the MetNI transporter have been elucidated, shedding light on its intricate mechanism of substrate recognition and translocation. The regulatory factors influencing the expression and activity of the MetNI transporter are under active investigation, with potential implications for the treatment of infectious diseases. Understanding the molecular details of the MetNI transporter may open new avenues for the development of antimicrobial strategies aimed at disrupting bacterial methionine uptake and survival.
