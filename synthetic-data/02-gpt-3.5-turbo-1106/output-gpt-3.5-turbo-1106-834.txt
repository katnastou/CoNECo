prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: BRM. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we investigated the role of the BRM protein complex in the development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Through the use of a mouse model, we observed a significant upregulation of BRM in HCC tissues compared to non-tumor liver tissues. Knockdown of BRM using siRNA resulted in a marked decrease in the proliferation and migration of HCC cells, suggesting a crucial role for BRM in HCC progression. Furthermore, we identified a potential interaction between BRM and the oncogene c-Myc, providing insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying HCC development. Our findings highlight the significance of the BRM protein complex in HCC pathogenesis and suggest its potential as a therapeutic target for this aggressive liver cancer.
