prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: parCE. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we investigated the role of the parCE protein complex in the pathogenesis of ovarian cancer. Our results demonstrated a significant upregulation of parCE expression in tumor tissue compared to normal ovarian tissue. Furthermore, using a combination of chemical inhibitors and genetic knockdown approaches, we were able to show that parCE plays a critical role in promoting the proliferation and metastatic potential of ovarian cancer cells. Additionally, we observed a positive correlation between parCE levels and tumor grade, suggesting a potential biomarker for disease severity. Overall, our findings highlight the importance of targeting parCE as a potential therapeutic strategy for ovarian cancer.
