prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: U2AF. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The splicing of pre-mRNA is a critical step in gene expression, and the U2AF protein complex plays a key role in this process. Recent studies have shown that U2AF is crucial for the recognition of 3' splice sites, contributing to the fidelity and efficiency of splicing. The interaction of U2AF with other splicing factors, such as the U2 snRNP, has been extensively investigated in various model organisms, including human, mouse, and yeast. Dysregulation of U2AF function has been implicated in several human diseases, including various types of cancer and neurodegenerative disorders. Understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying U2AF function may offer new insights into the pathogenesis and potential therapeutic targets for these conditions.
