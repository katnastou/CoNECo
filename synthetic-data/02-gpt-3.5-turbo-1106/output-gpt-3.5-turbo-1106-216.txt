prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: NMS. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we investigate the impact of a novel small molecule inhibitor on the activity of the NMS protein complex in a murine model of Alzheimer's disease. Our results show that treatment with the inhibitor leads to a significant reduction in the production of amyloid beta peptide, a key pathological marker of the disease. Furthermore, we observed a decrease in neuroinflammation and improved cognitive function in treated animals compared to untreated controls. These findings suggest that targeting the NMS protein complex holds promise as a therapeutic strategy for Alzheimer's disease. Our study provides important insights into the role of the NMS complex in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease and sheds light on potential avenues for the development of novel therapeutics.
