prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: nuclear pore. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In recent years, the role of the nuclear pore has emerged as a critical determinant of cellular function and homeostasis. The nuclear pore is a large protein complex spanning the nuclear envelope and is responsible for regulating the transport of various molecules between the cytoplasm and the nucleus. Dysregulation of nuclear pore function has been implicated in several human diseases, including cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, and viral infections. Furthermore, the interaction between the nuclear pore and specific chemical compounds has been shown to influence cellular processes, providing potential therapeutic targets for the treatment of nuclear pore-related diseases. Understanding the intricate regulatory mechanisms governing the nuclear pore complex holds promise for the development of novel interventions aimed at restoring cellular homeostasis and mitigating disease pathology.
