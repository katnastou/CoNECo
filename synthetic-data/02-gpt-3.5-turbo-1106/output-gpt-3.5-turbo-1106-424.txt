prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: IL7-receptor. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we investigated the role of the IL7-receptor in the development of T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL). We utilized a murine model to assess the impact of IL7-receptor dysregulation on disease progression and found that aberrant IL7-receptor signaling significantly accelerated leukemic cell proliferation and dissemination in vivo. Furthermore, analysis of patient samples revealed a positive correlation between elevated IL7-receptor expression and disease severity in T-ALL. These findings highlight the potential of IL7-receptor as a therapeutic target for T-ALL and underscore the significance of further elucidating the molecular mechanisms underlying its involvement in disease pathogenesis.
