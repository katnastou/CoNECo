prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: collagen type VI trimer. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we investigated the role of the collagen type VI trimer in the pathogenesis of muscular dystrophy. Through our examination of muscle biopsies from affected individuals, we observed a significant reduction in the abundance of collagen type VI trimers compared to healthy control samples. Furthermore, our findings revealed a correlation between the decreased levels of collagen type VI trimers and the severity of muscle fibrosis and atrophy in patients with muscular dystrophy. These results provide valuable insights into the potential therapeutic targets for the amelioration of muscular dystrophy-associated pathologies and underscore the importance of understanding the involvement of collagen type VI trimers in the disease progression.
