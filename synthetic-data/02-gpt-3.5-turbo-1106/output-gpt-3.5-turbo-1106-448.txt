prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: interleukin-28 receptor. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: Recent studies have shed light on the intricate signaling pathways involving the interleukin-28 receptor (IL-28 receptor) and their association with the progression of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. The IL-28 receptor is known to primarily interact with interferon lambda leading to the activation of downstream antiviral responses. Furthermore, the dysregulation of IL-28 receptor signaling has been implicated in the development of liver fibrosis and cirrhosis, major complications of chronic HCV infection. Targeted therapeutics aimed at modulating IL-28 receptor activity hold promise for the treatment of HCV-associated liver diseases. These findings underscore the crucial role of IL-28 receptor in mediating immune responses against HCV and its potential as a therapeutic target for mitigating disease progression.
