prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: Follitropin. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we investigated the relationship between Follitropin and the development of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) in a cohort of women. We assessed the levels of Follitropin in the serum of patients with PCOS and found a significant correlation with the severity of the condition. Additionally, we examined the genetic variants of the Follitropin receptor in this population and identified mutations associated with increased Follitropin signaling, which may contribute to the pathogenesis of PCOS. Our findings suggest that Follitropin may play a key role in the pathophysiology of PCOS and could serve as a potential therapeutic target for this common endocrine disorder.
