prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: ESCRT IV. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The ESCRT IV protein complex has been identified as a key player in endosomal sorting and multivesicular body (MVB) biogenesis pathways. It functions in the recognition and sorting of ubiquitinated proteins destined for degradation, highlighting its crucial role in maintaining cellular homeostasis. Additionally, ESCRT IV has been implicated in various cellular processes, including membrane remodeling, cytokinesis, and viral budding. Dysregulation of ESCRT IV has been associated with several human diseases, such as neurodegenerative disorders and viral infections. Understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying ESCRT IV function could provide new insights into disease pathogenesis and potential therapeutic targets. Further investigation into the regulation and interactions of ESCRT IV may uncover novel strategies for the treatment of ESCRT IV-related diseases.
