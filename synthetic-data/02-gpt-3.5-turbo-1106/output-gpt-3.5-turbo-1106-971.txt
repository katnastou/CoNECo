prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: SAT. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we investigated the role of the SAT protein complex in the regulation of cellular antioxidant pathways. Our findings reveal a novel interaction between the SAT complex and the redox signaling molecule, glutathione, in the context of oxidative stress. Furthermore, we observed that the SAT complex plays a crucial role in mitigating the effects of oxidative damage in mammalian cells, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target for oxidative stress-related diseases such as neurodegenerative disorders and cardiovascular complications. Our data provides valuable insights into the functional significance of the SAT complex in cellular homeostasis and its implications for the development of novel therapeutics.
