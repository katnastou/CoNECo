prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: clathrin. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The clathrin protein complex plays a crucial role in the process of receptor-mediated endocytosis, a key mechanism involved in the regulation of cell signaling and nutrient uptake. Previous studies have shown that disruption of clathrin function can lead to impaired internalization of important signaling receptors, resulting in dysregulated cell signaling and potential pathogenesis of various diseases. Recent investigations have focused on understanding the intricate interplay between clathrin-mediated endocytosis and the intracellular trafficking of vital nutrients and pathogens. The involvement of clathrin in these fundamental cellular processes highlights its potential as a target for therapeutic intervention in diseases characterized by aberrant endocytic trafficking. Further elucidation of the molecular mechanisms governing clathrin function holds promise for the development of novel strategies aimed at modulating cellular uptake and signaling pathways.
