prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: PRC2.2. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The Polycomb Repressive Complex 2.2 (PRC2.2) is a key regulator of gene expression involved in the epigenetic control of cellular processes. Recent studies have implicated PRC2.2 in the aberrant silencing of tumor suppressor genes in several types of cancer, including prostate cancer and leukemia. Dysregulation of PRC2.2 has also been associated with developmental disorders such as Weaver syndrome. The activity of PRC2.2 is modulated by various chemical compounds and signaling pathways, and its interactions with other protein complexes, such as SWI/SNF and NuRD, have been shown to influence its repressive function. Understanding the role of PRC2.2 in disease pathogenesis may provide novel therapeutic targets for the treatment of these conditions.
