prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: HDL3. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: High-density lipoprotein 3 (HDL3) is a crucial component of the lipid metabolism system and plays a central role in cardiovascular health. Numerous epidemiological studies have established an inverse relationship between plasma levels of HDL3 and the risk of developing coronary heart disease. This complex, consisting of lipids such as cholesterol and phospholipids, has been shown to exert potent anti-atherogenic effects, including the promotion of reverse cholesterol transport, antioxidative activity, and anti-inflammatory properties. Dysregulation or dysfunction of HDL3 has been implicated in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis, a condition characterized by the formation of arterial plaques and increased risk of myocardial infarction. Furthermore, ongoing investigations are delving into the potential therapeutic interventions targeting HDL3 to mitigate the burden of cardiovascular diseases in at-risk populations. Understanding the role of HDL3 in lipid metabolism and cardiovascular health is crucial for the development of novel approaches for prevention and treatment of coronary artery disease.
