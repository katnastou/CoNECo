prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: Fc-gamma receptor I. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we investigated the role of the Fc-gamma receptor I (FcγRI) in the pathogenesis of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Using a murine model of SLE, we demonstrated that FcγRI plays a critical role in the initiation and progression of the disease. We found that FcγRI expression was upregulated in the immune cells of SLE mice, and blockade of FcγRI resulted in a significant reduction in disease severity and improved survival. Furthermore, we observed that FcγRI-mediated immune complex uptake and activation of inflammatory pathways were essential for the development of SLE manifestations. Our findings highlight FcγRI as a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of SLE and provide mechanistic insights into the contribution of this protein complex to autoimmune pathologies.
