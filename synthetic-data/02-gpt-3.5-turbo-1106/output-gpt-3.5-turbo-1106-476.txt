prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: PAXT. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The PAXT protein complex has been implicated in the regulation of mRNA decay in eukaryotic cells. Recent studies have identified an interaction between PAXT and the exosome complex, suggesting a role in the targeting of mRNA for degradation. Additionally, the PAXT complex has been shown to associate with various RNA-binding proteins, such as GRSF1 and ZC3HAV1, highlighting its involvement in RNA processing and surveillance. Dysregulation of PAXT has been linked to neurodegenerative diseases, such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, implicating its potential role in the pathogenesis of these disorders. Further investigation of the molecular mechanisms underlying PAXT function may provide insights into novel therapeutic strategies for diseases associated with mRNA dysregulation.
