prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: TRAP transporter. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The TRAP transporter is a well-studied integral membrane protein complex in bacteria, responsible for the uptake of essential di- and tripeptides. Recent research has shed light on the regulatory mechanisms governing TRAP transporter expression and activity. By utilizing high-throughput screening assays, small molecule inhibitors targeting the TRAP transporter have been identified as potential therapeutic agents against bacterial infections. Moreover, studies have elucidated the contribution of TRAP transporter dysregulation to the pathogenesis of gastrointestinal diseases, highlighting its potential as a target for the development of novel treatment strategies. These findings underscore the significance of further investigations into the functional properties and pharmacological modulation of the TRAP transporter in both health and disease.
