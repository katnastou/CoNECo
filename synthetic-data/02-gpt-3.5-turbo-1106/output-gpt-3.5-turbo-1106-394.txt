prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: TRC. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we investigated the role of the TRC protein complex in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases. Using a transgenic mouse model, we observed significant dysregulation of neuroinflammatory markers in the brains of mice overexpressing the TRC protein complex. Furthermore, our analysis of post-mortem brain tissue from Alzheimer's disease patients revealed an abnormal accumulation of TRC in affected brain regions, suggesting a potential link between TRC and the progression of neurodegenerative disorders. Our findings underscore the importance of further exploring the molecular mechanisms underlying the involvement of TRC in neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration, with implications for the development of novel therapeutic strategies targeting TRC-mediated pathways in these devastating conditions.
