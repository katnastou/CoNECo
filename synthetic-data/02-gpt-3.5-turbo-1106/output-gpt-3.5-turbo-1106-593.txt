prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: TCR. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The T-cell receptor (TCR) is a crucial component of the adaptive immune system and plays a critical role in recognizing and responding to foreign antigens. TCR binds to peptide antigens presented by major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules on the surface of antigen-presenting cells, leading to downstream signaling events that initiate T-cell activation. Dysregulation of TCR signaling has been implicated in various autoimmune diseases, including rheumatoid arthritis and multiple sclerosis. Furthermore, studies have shown that the interaction between TCR and its ligands can be modulated by small molecule inhibitors, providing potential therapeutic targets for immune-related disorders. Understanding the molecular mechanisms governing TCR function and regulation is imperative for developing novel strategies to manipulate T-cell responses in the context of autoimmune diseases and cancer immunotherapy.
