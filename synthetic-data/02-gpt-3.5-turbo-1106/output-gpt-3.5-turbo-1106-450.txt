prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: Kat6. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The regulatory role of the lysine acetyltransferase 6 (Kat6) protein complex in the pathogenesis of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) has been the focus of extensive investigation in recent years. This study aimed to assess the potential therapeutic benefit of targeting Kat6 in AML using a novel small molecule inhibitor. Employing a range of in vitro and in vivo assays, this research delineates the critical role of Kat6 in promoting AML cell proliferation and survival. Our results demonstrate that inhibition of Kat6 activity disrupted the acetylation of key histone proteins, leading to the repression of oncogenic transcriptional programs. Furthermore, pharmacological ablation of Kat6 activity resulted in a substantial reduction in AML tumor burden and prolonged survival in a mouse model of AML. Collectively, these findings underscore the potential of targeting the Kat6 protein complex as a promising therapeutic strategy for AML.
