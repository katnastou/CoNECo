prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: surface IgG2a. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we investigated the role of the surface IgG2a protein complex in the immune response to Streptococcus pneumoniae infection. We utilized a murine model to characterize the interaction between surface IgG2a and the bacterial surface antigens. Our findings revealed a significant increase in the expression and binding affinity of surface IgG2a to pneumococcal polysaccharides, ultimately leading to enhanced opsonization and phagocytosis of the pathogen by macrophages. Furthermore, we observed that mice lacking surface IgG2a exhibited a higher susceptibility to pneumococcal infection, demonstrating the importance of this protein complex in host defense against pneumococcal disease. These results contribute to our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying the immune response to bacterial pathogens and suggest surface IgG2a as a potential target for therapeutic intervention in pneumococcal infections.
