prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: VLA-3. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The VLA-3 protein complex has gained attention in the context of autoimmune diseases, particularly in the development of therapeutic interventions for rheumatoid arthritis. Previous studies have highlighted the role of VLA-3 in mediating leukocyte adhesion to vascular endothelial cells, a key process in the pathogenesis of inflammatory responses. It has also been proposed that small molecule inhibitors targeting the interaction between VLA-3 and its ligands could potentially mitigate the progression of autoimmune disorders. Further investigations into the molecular mechanisms governing the function of VLA-3 and its potential as a therapeutic target are warranted. This could shed light on novel strategies for managing autoimmune diseases and offer new avenues for drug development.
