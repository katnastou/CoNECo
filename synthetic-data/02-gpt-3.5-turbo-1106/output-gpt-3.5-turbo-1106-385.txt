prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: RSR. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we aimed to investigate the role of the RSR protein complex in the progression of neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease. Using a combination of in vitro and in vivo models, we examined the interaction of RSR with key biochemical markers associated with neuroinflammation and oxidative stress. Our results demonstrated a potential link between the dysregulation of RSR and the development of neurodegenerative pathologies. Furthermore, our findings suggest that targeting the RSR complex may offer a novel therapeutic strategy for mitigating the progression of neurodegenerative diseases. This study sheds light on the intricate molecular mechanisms underlying neurodegeneration and highlights the potential of targeting the RSR complex for future therapeutic interventions.
