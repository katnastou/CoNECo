prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: laminin-221. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we investigated the role of laminin-221 in the pathogenesis of Duchenne muscular dystrophy. Our findings revealed a significant upregulation of laminin-221 expression in the muscle tissue of affected individuals compared to healthy controls. Furthermore, we observed a positive correlation between laminin-221 levels and disease severity, as indicated by muscle weakness and degeneration. In vitro experiments using myoblast cell lines confirmed the ability of laminin-221 to enhance adhesion and proliferation, suggesting a potential role in muscle regeneration. Our results highlight laminin-221 as a promising therapeutic target for the management of Duchenne muscular dystrophy and provide valuable insights into the underlying molecular mechanisms contributing to the disease pathology.
