prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: laminin-4. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: Laminin-4, a heterotrimeric glycoprotein complex, plays a crucial role in maintaining the structural integrity of the extracellular matrix (ECM). Aberrant laminin-4 expression has been implicated in various pathological conditions, including cancer metastasis and basement membrane disorders. Recent studies have revealed the involvement of laminin-4 in promoting angiogenesis and vascularization, thus highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target for diseases such as diabetic retinopathy and wound healing. Furthermore, interactions of laminin-4 with integrins and proteoglycans have been shown to modulate cell adhesion, migration, and signaling pathways, implicating its importance in cell behavior and tissue organization. Understanding the multifaceted roles of laminin-4 in physiological and pathological processes could provide novel insights for developing targeted interventions in diverse clinical settings.
