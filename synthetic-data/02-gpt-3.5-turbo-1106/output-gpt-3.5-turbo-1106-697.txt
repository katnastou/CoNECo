prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: mitochondrial complex III. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: Mitochondrial complex III is a crucial component of the electron transport chain located within the inner mitochondrial membrane. This complex plays a fundamental role in cellular respiration by transferring electrons from ubiquinol to cytochrome c, thereby contributing to the generation of the proton gradient necessary for ATP synthesis. Recent studies have highlighted the importance of mitochondrial complex III in the context of various pathophysiological conditions, including mitochondrial diseases and neurodegenerative disorders. Dysregulation or dysfunction of this complex has been implicated in the pathogenesis of diseases such as Parkinson's disease and Leigh syndrome. Furthermore, small molecule inhibitors targeting mitochondrial complex III have shown promise as potential therapeutic agents for certain malignancies, providing a novel avenue for cancer treatment. Given its critical role in energy production and its implications in human health and disease, mitochondrial complex III represents an intriguing target for further investigation and potential therapeutic intervention.
