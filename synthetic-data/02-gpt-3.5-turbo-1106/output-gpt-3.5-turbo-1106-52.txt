prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: phosphoinositide 3-kinase complex, class III. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The phosphoinositide 3-kinase complex, class III (PI3KC3) plays a crucial role in the regulation of autophagy, a cellular process important for maintaining cellular homeostasis and responding to various stress conditions. This complex consists of several subunits, including VPS34, VPS15, Beclin-1, and ATG14. Dysregulation of PI3KC3 has been implicated in various human diseases, including cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, and infectious diseases. Understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying the function of PI3KC3 is essential for the development of targeted therapies aimed at modulating autophagy to treat these diseases. This review provides an overview of the current knowledge regarding the role of PI3KC3 in autophagy and its potential therapeutic implications.
