prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: TIMM23. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: Recent studies have demonstrated the crucial role of the translocase of the inner mitochondrial membrane 23 (TIMM23) protein complex in the import of nuclear-encoded proteins into the mitochondria. Mutations in genes encoding components of this complex have been associated with a variety of mitochondrial disorders, including neuromuscular diseases and metabolic dysfunction. The proposed involvement of TIMM23 in the pathogenesis of such disorders highlights the significance of studying the molecular mechanisms underlying its function. These findings shed light on potential therapeutic targets for the treatment of mitochondrial diseases and provide valuable insights for the development of novel therapeutic strategies aimed at restoring normal mitochondrial protein import and function. Further investigation into the regulation and function of TIMM23 is warranted to fully understand its role in health and disease.
