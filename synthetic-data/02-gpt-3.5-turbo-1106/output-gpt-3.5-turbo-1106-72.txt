prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: DNA polymerase Vs. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we investigated the impact of nucleotide analogs on the activity of the DNA polymerase Vε protein complex. We utilized a cell-based assay system to assess the effects of specific nucleotide analogs, including cytarabine and gemcitabine, on the fidelity and efficiency of DNA replication mediated by DNA polymerase Vε. Our findings demonstrate that certain nucleotide analogs can induce errors in DNA replication, leading to the accumulation of DNA damage and potential genomic instability. These results have important implications for understanding the mechanisms underlying the development of drug resistance in cancer cells, as well as for the design of more effective chemotherapeutic strategies targeting DNA polymerase Vε-mediated DNA synthesis.
