prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: Sim4. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The study investigated the role of the Sim4 protein complex in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease. Using a transgenic mouse model overexpressing the Sim4 protein complex, we observed a significant increase in amyloid beta deposition in the brain, as well as enhanced neuroinflammation and cognitive impairment compared to control mice. Furthermore, pharmacological inhibition of Sim4 resulted in a reduction of amyloid beta levels and improved cognitive function in the mouse model. Our findings suggest that the Sim4 protein complex may play a crucial role in the progression of Alzheimer's disease and could serve as a potential therapeutic target for intervention.
