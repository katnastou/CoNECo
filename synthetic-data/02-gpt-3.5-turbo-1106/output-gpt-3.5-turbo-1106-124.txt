prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: alpha-glucosidase II. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we investigated the role of the protein complex alpha-glucosidase II in the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes mellitus. Using a mouse model of the disease, we observed that inhibition of alpha-glucosidase II activity resulted in improved glucose homeostasis and reduced insulin resistance. Furthermore, we identified a novel small molecule inhibitor of alpha-glucosidase II that exhibited potent anti-diabetic effects in vivo. Our findings highlight alpha-glucosidase II as a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus and suggest that modulation of its activity may lead to new avenues for developing anti-diabetic therapies.
