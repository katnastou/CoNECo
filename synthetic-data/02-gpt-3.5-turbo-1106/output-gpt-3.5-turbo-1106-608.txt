prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: box C/D snoRNP. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: This study investigates the role of the box C/D snoRNP complex in the pathogenesis of pulmonary fibrosis, a progressive lung disease characterized by excessive deposition of extracellular matrix components. Using a murine model of pulmonary fibrosis, we demonstrate a dysregulation of box C/D snoRNP complex activity in lung tissue samples from affected animals, as evidenced by altered levels of specific small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs) associated with this complex. Furthermore, we identify a potential link between box C/D snoRNP dysfunction and aberrant epigenetic modifications in the lungs of fibrotic mice. Our findings suggest that targeting box C/D snoRNP function may offer a novel therapeutic strategy for the treatment of pulmonary fibrosis.
