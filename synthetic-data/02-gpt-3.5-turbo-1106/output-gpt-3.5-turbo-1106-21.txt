prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: semaphorin receptor. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The semaphorin receptor has been increasingly implicated in the pathogenesis of various neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative disorders. This protein complex has been found to interact with a range of ligands, including semaphorins and plexins, and has been shown to be involved in axon guidance, synaptic plasticity, and neuroinflammation. Studies have also demonstrated dysregulation of the semaphorin receptor in neurological diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and autism spectrum disorders. Furthermore, small molecule inhibitors targeting the semaphorin receptor are being investigated as potential therapeutic agents for these conditions. Further elucidation of the role of the semaphorin receptor in these diseases may provide novel insights into their pathophysiology and identify new avenues for therapeutic intervention.
