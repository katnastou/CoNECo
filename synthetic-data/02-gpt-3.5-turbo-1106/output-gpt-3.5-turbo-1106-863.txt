prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: GABA-A receptor. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The GABA-A receptor is a crucial component of the inhibitory neurotransmission system in the central nervous system. Dysfunction of this protein complex has been implicated in numerous neurological disorders, including epilepsy, anxiety disorders, and insomnia. Recent studies have focused on the development of novel allosteric modulators targeting the GABA-A receptor to enhance its inhibitory function, thereby potentially offering new therapeutic avenues for these neurological conditions. Moreover, the interaction between the GABA-A receptor and small molecule ligands, such as benzodiazepines, has been extensively investigated, shedding light on the molecular mechanisms underlying their anxiolytic and sedative effects. Understanding the structure and function of the GABA-A receptor is key for the development of more effective and safer pharmacological interventions for neurological disorders.
