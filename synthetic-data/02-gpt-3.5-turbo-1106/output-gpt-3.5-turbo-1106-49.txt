prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: MsbA. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The ATP-binding cassette transporter MsbA has been the focus of recent studies due to its critical role in the efflux of lipid A, a key component of bacterial outer membrane, and its potential implications in antibiotic resistance. The interaction of MsbA with lipid A is of particular interest in understanding the mechanisms of Gram-negative bacterial pathogenesis, as alterations in MsbA's function have been associated with changes in cellular susceptibility to antibiotics. Additionally, the link between MsbA dysfunction and the development of bacterial infections such as meningitis and sepsis underscores the importance of further research to elucidate the underlying molecular mechanisms. The elucidation of the structure and function of MsbA may provide valuable insights for the development of novel therapeutic strategies targeting bacterial infections and antibiotic resistance.
