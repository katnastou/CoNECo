prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: IRF. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The transcription factor IRF is a key regulator of the innate immune response, playing a critical role in the activation of interferon-stimulated genes. Dysregulation of IRF has been linked to various autoimmune diseases, including systemic lupus erythematosus and rheumatoid arthritis. Previous studies have shown that the phosphorylation of IRF is essential for its nuclear translocation and subsequent binding to target gene promoters. Furthermore, small molecule inhibitors targeting the interaction between IRF and its co-activators have shown promising results in preclinical models of inflammatory conditions. Further elucidation of the molecular mechanisms underlying IRF activation and function may inform the development of novel therapeutic interventions for immune-mediated disorders.
