prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: extracellular ferritin. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: Extracellular ferritin has emerged as a crucial hub in the regulation of iron metabolism and oxidative stress. Recent studies have provided insights into the role of extracellular ferritin in the pathogenesis of various diseases, including neurodegenerative disorders, cardiovascular diseases, and cancer. Notably, extracellular ferritin has been implicated in modulating the inflammatory response and influencing the progression of chronic inflammatory conditions. Furthermore, extracellular ferritin has been identified as a potential target for therapeutic intervention aiming to mitigate the damaging effects of iron overload and oxidative stress. Therefore, a deeper understanding of the signaling pathways involving extracellular ferritin holds promise for the development of novel therapeutic strategies in the management of diseases associated with dysregulated iron homeostasis and oxidative damage.
