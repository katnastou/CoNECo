prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: cohesin. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The cohesin protein complex has been implicated in various human diseases, including Cornelia de Lange syndrome and some types of cancer. Recent studies have highlighted the role of cohesin in regulating chromosome condensation during cell division, as well as in DNA repair processes. Dysregulation of cohesin function has been linked to genomic instability and aberrant cell proliferation. Furthermore, evidence suggests that cohesin interacts with specific chemical modulators, such as the small molecule inhibitor known as aclarubicin, which may offer potential therapeutic opportunities for diseases associated with cohesin dysfunction. Understanding the intricate regulatory mechanisms of the cohesin complex may pave the way for the development of novel targeted therapies for these debilitating conditions.
