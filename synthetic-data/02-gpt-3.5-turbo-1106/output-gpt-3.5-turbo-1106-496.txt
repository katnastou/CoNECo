prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: MutLbeta. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: MutLbeta is a key player in the DNA mismatch repair process, where it is involved in the recognition and subsequent correction of DNA replication errors. This protein complex, consisting of MutL homolog 1 and MutL homolog 2 subunits, has been extensively studied in various model organisms including bacteria, yeast, and mammals. Dysfunction of MutLbeta has been implicated in the development of hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer, highlighting its crucial role in maintaining genomic stability. Recent research has also uncovered potential interactions between MutLbeta and specific chemical agents, suggesting a possible avenue for targeted therapeutics in cancer treatment. Understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying the function of MutLbeta is essential for developing interventions to mitigate its pathological effects in human health.
