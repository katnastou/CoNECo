prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: N-terminal acetyltransferase B. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The protein complex N-terminal acetyltransferase B has been implicated in various cellular processes, including protein stability and function. Previous studies have shown that the enzymatic activity of N-terminal acetyltransferase B is critical for the proper acetylation of nascent polypeptides, thus impacting their subsequent folding and subcellular localization. Notably, dysregulation of N-terminal acetyltransferase B has been linked to several neurodegenerative disorders, suggesting a potential role in the pathogenesis of these diseases. Furthermore, recent investigations have unveiled the interplay between N-terminal acetyltransferase B and specific cellular signaling pathways, providing insights into its broader regulatory functions. Understanding the molecular mechanisms governing the activity of N-terminal acetyltransferase B may offer novel opportunities for therapeutic intervention in diseases characterized by protein misfolding and dysfunction.
