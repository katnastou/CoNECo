prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: NuMRP. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The NuMRP protein complex has been implicated in the regulation of mitochondrial ribosome biogenesis. Recent studies have highlighted the role of NuMRP in modulating the expression of mitochondrial respiratory chain subunits, leading to increased oxidative phosphorylation capacity. Furthermore, dysregulation of NuMRP has been associated with the development of mitochondrial dysfunction-related diseases, such as mitochondrial encephalomyopathy. These findings underscore the importance of further exploring the molecular mechanisms underlying the function of NuMRP and its potential as a therapeutic target for mitochondrial disorders.
