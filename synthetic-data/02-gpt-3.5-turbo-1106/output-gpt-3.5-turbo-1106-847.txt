prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: Rad50. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The Rad50 protein complex has been implicated in the maintenance of genome stability and has drawn significant attention due to its role in DNA repair mechanisms. Recent studies have focused on the interactions of Rad50 with key tumor suppressor proteins, providing insights into its potential involvement in modulating the cellular response to DNA damage. Furthermore, investigations into the functional significance of Rad50 in cellular processes such as cell cycle regulation and telomere maintenance have uncovered its potential as a therapeutic target for cancer treatment. Understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying the functions of the Rad50 complex may have crucial implications for the development of novel strategies for cancer therapy and prevention.
