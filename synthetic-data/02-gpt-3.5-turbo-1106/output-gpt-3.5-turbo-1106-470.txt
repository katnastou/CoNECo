prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: galectin-2. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: Galectin-2, a member of the galectin family, has gained attention in the field of cardiovascular research due to its potential role in atherosclerosis development and progression. Recent studies have identified galectin-2 as a key mediator of inflammatory processes within the arterial wall, with implications for the pathogenesis of atherosclerotic plaques. Additionally, galectin-2 has been implicated in regulating endothelial cell function and vascular remodeling, suggesting a potential link between galectin-2 expression and cardiovascular disease progression. Further investigation into the precise molecular mechanisms and signaling pathways involving galectin-2 is warranted to elucidate its potential as a therapeutic target for atherosclerosis and related cardiovascular disorders.
