prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: 5-hydroxytryptamine receptor 3. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we investigated the role of the 5-hydroxytryptamine receptor 3 (5-HT3 receptor) in the pathogenesis of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Our results demonstrate that the activation of 5-HT3 receptors by serotonin leads to increased gut motility and visceral hypersensitivity in a rodent model of IBS. Additionally, we found that the use of a specific 5-HT3 receptor antagonist mitigated the symptoms of IBS in these animals, suggesting a potential therapeutic target for this prevalent gastrointestinal disorder. These findings provide valuable insights into the underlying mechanisms of IBS and highlight the potential for targeting the 5-HT3 receptor as a novel therapeutic approach for the management of this condition.
