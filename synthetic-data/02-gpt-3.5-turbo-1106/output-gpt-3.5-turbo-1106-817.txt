prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: interleukin-13 receptor. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we investigated the role of the interleukin-13 receptor (IL-13R) in the pathogenesis of asthma. We examined the expression levels of IL-13R in bronchial tissue samples from patients with asthma and healthy controls using immunohistochemistry. Our results demonstrated a significant upregulation of IL-13R expression in the bronchial epithelium of asthmatic patients compared to controls. Furthermore, we observed a positive correlation between IL-13R expression and disease severity as measured by bronchial hyperresponsiveness and forced expiratory volume in 1 second. These findings suggest that IL-13R may play a crucial role in the inflammatory response in asthma and could serve as a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of this debilitating disease.
