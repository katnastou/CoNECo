prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: respiratory chain complex IV. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The role of mitochondrial dysfunction in cardiomyopathy has been a subject of significant interest in recent years. In particular, the respiratory chain complex IV, also known as cytochrome c oxidase, has been implicated in the pathogenesis of various cardiomyopathies. Defects in this protein complex have been associated with impaired electron transfer and ATP synthesis, leading to reduced energy production in cardiac muscle cells. Mutations in genes encoding subunits of respiratory chain complex IV have been linked to familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and dilated cardiomyopathy in humans. Furthermore, exposure to environmental toxins such as cyanide, a known inhibitor of cytochrome c oxidase, has been shown to induce myocardial damage and cardiac dysfunction. Understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying the involvement of respiratory chain complex IV in cardiomyopathy may provide insights for the development of targeted therapies for these debilitating heart diseases.
