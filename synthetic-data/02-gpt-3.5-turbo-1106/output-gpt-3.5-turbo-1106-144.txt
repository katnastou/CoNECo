prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: GABA transaminase. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we aimed to investigate the role of the GABA transaminase protein complex in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease. Using a murine model of the disease, we observed a significant downregulation of GABA transaminase expression in the striatum, suggesting a potential link between GABA transaminase dysfunction and the development of Parkinson's disease. Furthermore, we also identified a correlation between GABA transaminase activity and the levels of dopamine in the brain, implicating the involvement of GABA transaminase in the regulation of dopamine neurotransmission. Our findings shed light on the potential therapeutic targets involving GABA transaminase for the treatment of Parkinson's disease.
