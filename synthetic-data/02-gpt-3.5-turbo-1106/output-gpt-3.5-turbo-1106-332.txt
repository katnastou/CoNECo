prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: polkadots. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In recent years, there has been growing interest in investigating the role of the polkadots protein complex in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases. Studies have demonstrated that the dysregulation of polkadots complex activity is associated with an increased risk of developing Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease. The complex interplay between polkadots and amyloid beta in Alzheimer's disease has attracted particular attention, with emerging evidence suggesting that the complex may play a key role in the formation of amyloid plaques and the progression of neuroinflammation. Additionally, studies in animal models have implicated dysregulated polkadots complex activity in the disruption of mitochondrial function, highlighting its potential contribution to the pathophysiology of neurodegenerative disorders. These findings underscore the importance of further investigating the intricate molecular mechanisms underlying the involvement of the polkadots complex in neurodegenerative diseases, with the ultimate goal of identifying novel therapeutic targets for intervention.
