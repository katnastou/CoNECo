prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: TCC. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The terminal complement complex (TCC) is a key effector of innate immunity, playing a crucial role in the pathophysiology of various diseases, including autoimmune disorders and inflammatory conditions. Upon activation of the complement cascade, TCC is formed by the assembly of multiple complement proteins, culminating in the formation of a pore-like structure on the surface of target cells. Recent studies have implicated TCC in the progression of systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis, and other autoimmune diseases, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target. Furthermore, dysregulation of TCC has been linked to neurodegenerative disorders and ischemia-reperfusion injury. Elucidating the molecular mechanisms underlying TCC assembly and its interactions with cellular and molecular targets holds promise for the development of novel therapeutic interventions for a wide range of immune-mediated and inflammatory conditions.
