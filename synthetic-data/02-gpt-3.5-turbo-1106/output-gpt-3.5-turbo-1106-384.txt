prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: NendoU. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: Recent studies have implicated the role of the NendoU protein complex in the pathogenesis of viral infections. The NendoU complex is a key component of the innate immune response, facilitating the process of viral RNA degradation and providing crucial defense mechanisms against viral replication. The dysregulation of NendoU activity has been linked to a variety of viral illnesses, including coronaviruses and influenza. Furthermore, investigations into the therapeutic potential of targeting the NendoU complex for the treatment of viral diseases have yielded promising results. These findings highlight the significance of the NendoU complex as a potential target for antiviral drug development, offering new avenues for combating viral infections and improving patient outcomes.
