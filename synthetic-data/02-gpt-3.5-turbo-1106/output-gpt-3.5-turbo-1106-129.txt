prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: HAUS. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The HAUS protein complex has been implicated in various cellular processes, including microtubule assembly and maintenance. Previous studies have indicated that mutations in genes encoding subunits of the HAUS complex are associated with developmental disorders and neurodegenerative diseases. In a recent investigation, it was found that the chemical compound MG132, a proteasome inhibitor, can disrupt the interaction between the HAUS complex and its downstream targets, leading to impaired cell division and increased susceptibility to DNA damage in human cell lines. Furthermore, experiments in a mouse model demonstrated that overexpression of the HAUS complex attenuated the progression of neurodegenerative symptoms associated with a familial form of Parkinson's disease. These findings provide novel insights into the functional role of the HAUS complex in disease pathways and may have therapeutic implications for neurodegenerative disorders.
