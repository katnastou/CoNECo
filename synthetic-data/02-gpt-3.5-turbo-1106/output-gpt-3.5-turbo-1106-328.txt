prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: MalFGK(2). Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we investigated the role of the MalFGK(2) protein complex in the pathogenesis of bacterial infections in humans. Upon exposure to various exogenous stressors, such as high glucose concentrations and lipopolysaccharides, the expression levels of MalFGK(2) were found to be upregulated in vitro using Escherichia coli strains. Additionally, our findings revealed a significant increase in the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor-alpha and interleukin-6, in response to MalFGK(2) overexpression. Furthermore, the in vivo model demonstrated a correlation between MalFGK(2) expression and the severity of infection, indicative of its potential as a therapeutic target for bacterial diseases. These results underscore the importance of MalFGK(2) in modulating host immune responses and suggest its involvement in the pathology of infectious diseases.
