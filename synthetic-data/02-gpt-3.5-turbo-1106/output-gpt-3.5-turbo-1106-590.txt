prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: interleukin-4 receptor. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The interleukin-4 receptor (IL-4R) is a crucial component in the immune response, playing a significant role in the pathogenesis of various diseases. IL-4R signaling has been implicated in the regulation of allergic inflammation, asthma, and other immune-related disorders. The binding of interleukin-4 to its receptor initiates downstream signaling cascades that modulate the activity of immune cells, including T cells, B cells, and macrophages. Dysregulation of IL-4R signaling has been associated with inflammatory bowel disease and certain types of cancer, making it an attractive target for therapeutic intervention. Understanding the intricate mechanisms underlying IL-4R function and regulation is essential for the development of novel treatment strategies for immune-mediated diseases.
