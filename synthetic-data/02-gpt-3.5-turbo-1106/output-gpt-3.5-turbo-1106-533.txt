prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: ZnuABC. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In recent years, the zinc transporter complex ZnuABC has garnered attention for its role in the acquisition of zinc in various bacterial species. Through metal uptake and transport mechanisms, this complex has been implicated in the virulence and survival of numerous pathogens, including Escherichia coli and Salmonella enterica. Dysregulation of zinc homeostasis has been linked to various diseases, such as inflammatory bowel disease and certain types of cancer, highlighting the importance of understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying ZnuABC function. Further investigation into the structure and regulation of this complex may provide valuable insights into the development of novel antimicrobial therapies and the treatment of zinc-related disorders.
