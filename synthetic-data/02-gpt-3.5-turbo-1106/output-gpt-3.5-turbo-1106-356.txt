prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: HA1. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In recent years, research on the pathogenesis of Influenza A virus (IAV) has focused on the role of the hemagglutinin protein in viral entry and pathogenicity. One notable protein complex involved in this process is the HA1. Studies have shown that the interaction between HA1 and sialic acid receptors on host cells is a critical determinant of viral tropism and infection. Furthermore, the conformational changes in HA1 that facilitate membrane fusion and endosomal escape have been identified as potential targets for antiviral drug development. The HA1 complex has also been implicated in the evasion of host immune responses, highlighting its significance in the establishment of viral infection. Understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying HA1 function may provide insights into the development of novel therapeutic strategies to combat Influenza A virus infections.
