prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: mtCU. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: Our study aimed to investigate the functional role of the mitochondrial calcium uptake (mtCU) complex in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease (PD). Using a combination of in vitro and in vivo models, we demonstrated that impairment of mtCU activity leads to dysregulation of mitochondrial calcium homeostasis, resulting in increased oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction. Moreover, we found that restoration of mtCU function using a specific small molecule agonist attenuated neurodegeneration and ameliorated motor deficits in a PD mouse model. Our findings suggest that targeting mtCU could represent a potential therapeutic strategy for preventing or treating PD by preserving mitochondrial function and attenuating neuronal damage.
