prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: eNoSc. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The eNoSc protein complex has been implicated in various cellular processes, including cellular respiration, cellular signaling, and gene regulation. Recent studies have highlighted a potential role for eNoSc in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular diseases, such as atherosclerosis and heart failure. Furthermore, eNoSc has been shown to interact with nitric oxide, a key signaling molecule involved in vasodilation and blood pressure regulation. Given its multifaceted functions, targeting eNoSc could offer new therapeutic strategies for the treatment of cardiovascular disorders. These findings underscore the importance of further investigating the molecular mechanisms underlying the biological functions of the eNoSc protein complex to uncover its potential as a therapeutic target for cardiovascular diseases.
