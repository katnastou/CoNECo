prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: 60S ribosomal subunit. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we investigated the role of the 60S ribosomal subunit in the pathogenesis of breast cancer. Through the analysis of breast cancer tissues and cell lines, we found a significant upregulation of the 60S ribosomal subunit in aggressive subtypes of breast cancer, particularly triple-negative breast cancer. Furthermore, our in vitro experiments demonstrated that inhibition of the 60S ribosomal subunit using a specific small molecule inhibitor resulted in a dramatic reduction in cancer cell proliferation and migration. Our findings suggest that the 60S ribosomal subunit may play a crucial role in the progression of aggressive breast cancer and could serve as a potential therapeutic target for this devastating disease.
