prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: Shu. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: Recent studies have illuminated the critical role of the Shu protein complex in maintaining genomic stability and preserving cellular integrity. The Shu complex has been shown to interact with various DNA repair pathways, such as homologous recombination and non-homologous end joining, thus highlighting its significance in safeguarding the genome from deleterious DNA lesions. Dysregulation of the Shu complex has been implicated in the pathogenesis of certain hereditary diseases, including Fanconi anemia and breast cancer. Furthermore, the Shu complex has been identified as a potential target for therapeutic interventions aimed at enhancing DNA repair mechanisms and mitigating the progression of cancer. As our understanding of the intricate functions and regulatory networks involving the Shu complex continues to expand, it offers promising prospects for the development of novel strategies to combat genomic instability-related disorders.
