prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: Tim22. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In recent studies, the involvement of the mitochondrial protein complex Tim22 in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases has come to light. Through a series of experiments involving cellular and animal models, it was found that mutations in the TIM22 complex resulted in impaired mitochondrial protein import and subsequent accumulation of misfolded proteins, leading to mitochondrial dysfunction and neuronal damage. Furthermore, the dysregulation of TIM22 was found to be associated with a decline in cognitive function and increased susceptibility to neurodegenerative conditions such as Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease. These findings shed light on the critical role of Tim22 in maintaining mitochondrial homeostasis and offer potential therapeutic targets for mitigating neurodegenerative disorders.
