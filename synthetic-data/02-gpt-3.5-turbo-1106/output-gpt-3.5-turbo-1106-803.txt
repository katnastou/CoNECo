prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: Hageman factor. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we aimed to investigate the role of the Hageman factor in the pathogenesis of thrombotic disorders. Utilizing a mouse model with genetic ablation of the Hageman factor, we observed a significant increase in thrombus formation following vascular injury. Furthermore, we found that the absence of Hageman factor was associated with enhanced platelet activation and aggregation. Additionally, administration of factor XIIa inhibitor effectively attenuated thrombus formation in Hageman factor-deficient mice. Our findings suggest that targeting the Hageman factor may serve as a promising therapeutic strategy for the prevention and treatment of thrombotic diseases.
