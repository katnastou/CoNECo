prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: CURI. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we investigated the role of the CURI protein complex in regulating glucose metabolism in human adipocytes. Our findings revealed that CURI plays a critical role in the maintenance of glucose homeostasis by affecting the expression and activity of key enzymes involved in glycolysis and gluconeogenesis. Furthermore, we observed that dysregulation of CURI expression was associated with insulin resistance and impaired glucose tolerance in adipose tissue from obese individuals. Importantly, our results suggest that targeting the CURI complex may hold therapeutic potential in the management of metabolic diseases such as type 2 diabetes. This research sheds light on the intricate molecular mechanisms underlying glucose metabolism and provides a foundation for future studies exploring the therapeutic targeting of CURI in metabolic disorders.
