prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: fibrinogen. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we investigated the role of fibrinogen in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis. Using a murine model of the disease, we observed a significant increase in fibrinogen levels in the plasma of ApoE-deficient mice fed a high-fat diet compared to control mice. Furthermore, histological analysis revealed a higher deposition of fibrinogen within atherosclerotic plaques, indicating its potential involvement in plaque formation and progression. Treatment with a specific fibrinogen inhibitor resulted in reduced plaque size and improved vascular function, supporting the idea that fibrinogen plays a critical role in atherosclerosis development. Overall, our findings highlight the potential therapeutic value of targeting fibrinogen in the management of atherosclerotic disease.
