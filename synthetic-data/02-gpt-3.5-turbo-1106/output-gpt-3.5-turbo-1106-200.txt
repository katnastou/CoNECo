prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: KICSTOR. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In recent years, the KICSTOR (KPTN, ITFG2, C12orf66, and SZT2) protein complex has emerged as a crucial modulator of cellular signaling pathways, particularly those involved in nutrient sensing and autophagy. Several studies have highlighted the pivotal role of KICSTOR in the regulation of mTORC1 activity and its impact on cellular growth and metabolism. Dysregulation of KICSTOR function has been linked to various pathological conditions, including neurodegenerative disorders and certain types of cancer. Furthermore, the interaction between KICSTOR and other protein complexes, such as the Rag GTPases, further underscores its significance in coordinating cellular responses to environmental cues. Understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying the function and regulation of KICSTOR holds substantial promise for the development of therapeutic strategies targeting mTORC1-related diseases.
