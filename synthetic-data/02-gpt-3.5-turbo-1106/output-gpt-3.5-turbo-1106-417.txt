prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: CD42. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The role of CD42 in platelet aggregation has been the subject of extensive investigation in recent years. Studies have suggested that CD42 plays a crucial role in the interaction between platelets and von Willebrand factor (vWF), as well as in the formation of platelet plugs at sites of vascular injury. Furthermore, there is evidence to suggest that mutations in the gene encoding CD42 are associated with a rare bleeding disorder known as Bernard-Soulier syndrome. These findings highlight the importance of CD42 in hemostasis and thrombosis, and underscore the potential clinical relevance of targeting CD42 for the treatment of bleeding disorders and cardiovascular diseases. Further research into the molecular mechanisms underlying the function of CD42 is warranted, with the aim of developing novel therapeutic strategies to modulate its activity.
