prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: WHY1. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The protein complex WHY1 has been implicated in the pathogenesis of colorectal cancer, where dysregulation of its activity has been associated with disease progression and metastasis. Recent studies have shown that the expression of WHY1 is significantly upregulated in colorectal tumor tissues compared to healthy adjacent tissues. Furthermore, downregulation of WHY1 in tumor cell lines has been shown to suppress their proliferation and invasiveness in in vitro models. Mechanistic studies have revealed that WHY1 functions as a key regulator of the Wnt signaling pathway, a pathway that is frequently dysregulated in colorectal cancer. Given its crucial role in tumor progression, WHY1 represents a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of colorectal cancer. Further research into the precise molecular mechanisms by which WHY1 regulates Wnt signaling and tumor progression may uncover novel avenues for the development of targeted therapies for this devastating disease.
