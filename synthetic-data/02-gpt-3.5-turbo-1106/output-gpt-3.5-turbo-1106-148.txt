prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: NatC. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The NatC complex is known to play a crucial role in protein targeting and initiation of translation in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. This conserved N-terminal acetyltransferase has been shown to be involved in the acetylation of numerous N-terminally acetylated proteins, impacting their cellular function and stability. Recent studies have identified potential links between dysregulation of the NatC complex and various human diseases, including cancer and neurodegenerative disorders. Furthermore, the NatC complex has been found to interact with specific small molecule inhibitors, offering potential opportunities for therapeutic interventions targeting diseases associated with NatC dysregulation. Further investigation of the molecular mechanisms underlying the function of the NatC complex and its implications in disease pathogenesis is warranted to advance our understanding of its biological significance and therapeutic potential.
