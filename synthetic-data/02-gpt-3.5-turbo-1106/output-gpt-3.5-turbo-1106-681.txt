prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: ADA HAT. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we investigated the role of the ADA HAT protein complex in the progression of X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy (X-ALD), a rare genetic disorder characterized by the accumulation of very long-chain fatty acids in various tissues. Using a mouse model of X-ALD, we found that disruption of the ADA HAT complex led to an exacerbation of neuroinflammation and demyelination in the central nervous system. Furthermore, our results suggest that the ADA HAT complex may play a critical role in regulating inflammatory responses and lipid metabolism in the context of X-ALD. These findings shed light on the potential therapeutic significance of targeting the ADA HAT complex in mitigating the neurological manifestations of X-ALD.
