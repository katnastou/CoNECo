prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: IDH3. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In recent years, there has been growing interest in the role of the IDH3 protein complex in the pathogenesis of various cancers. Studies have shown that dysregulation of the IDH3 complex is associated with abnormal metabolic processes in cancer cells, leading to the accumulation of oncometabolites such as 2-hydroxyglutarate. This aberrant metabolic profile not only contributes to tumor initiation and progression but also impacts the tumor microenvironment. Moreover, investigations into targeted therapies for IDH3 complex dysfunction have shown promising results, offering potential avenues for precision medicine in the treatment of IDH3-associated malignancies. Further research into the molecular mechanisms underlying IDH3 complex dysregulation is warranted to fully elucidate its clinical implications and pursue new therapeutic strategies.
