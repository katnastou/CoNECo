prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: intraflagellar transport complex B. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The intraflagellar transport complex B (IFT-B) plays a crucial role in the assembly and maintenance of cilia, which are essential organelles that facilitate signaling and sensory functions in various cell types. Dysfunction of IFT-B has been implicated in ciliopathies, a group of genetic disorders characterized by abnormal cilia structure and function, leading to a wide range of clinical manifestations including polycystic kidney disease, retinal degeneration, and neurological defects. Several studies have revealed the involvement of IFT-B in transporting specific cargo proteins along the ciliary axoneme, highlighting its importance in ciliary biogenesis and function. Understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying IFT-B-mediated transport and its regulation has significant implications for the development of potential therapeutic interventions for ciliopathies and related disorders.
