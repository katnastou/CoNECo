prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: dynein. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In recent years, significant attention has been dedicated to understanding the regulatory mechanisms governing the dynein protein complex, a key molecular motor involved in intracellular transportation. Dysregulation of dynein function has been implicated in a variety of neurodegenerative disorders, including Huntington's disease and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. The interaction between dynein and its associated regulatory proteins has been found to be crucial for maintaining cellular homeostasis. Moreover, emerging evidence suggests that small molecule modulators targeting dynein activity could hold therapeutic potential for mitigating the progression of neurodegenerative conditions. Thus, elucidating the molecular pathways that regulate dynein function may provide valuable insights for the development of novel therapeutic strategies targeting neurodegenerative diseases.
