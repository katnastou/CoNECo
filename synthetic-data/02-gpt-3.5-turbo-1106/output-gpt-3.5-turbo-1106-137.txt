prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: channel-forming toxin. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The channel-forming toxin has been a subject of significant interest due to its role in the pathogenesis of various infectious diseases. This potent virulence factor is known to disrupt cellular membrane integrity, leading to ion imbalance and ultimately cellular dysfunction. Studies have implicated the channel-forming toxin in the pathogenesis of infections caused by several pathogenic bacteria, including Gram-negative and Gram-positive organisms. Understanding the structure and function of this toxin is crucial for the development of targeted therapeutic interventions against infectious diseases. Furthermore, elucidating the mechanisms underlying the host-pathogen interaction mediated by the channel-forming toxin holds promise for the development of novel antimicrobial strategies.
