prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: BC. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In recent years, there has been growing interest in the role of the BC protein complex in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases. The BC complex has been implicated in regulating cellular homeostasis and metabolism, and dysfunction of this complex has been associated with the development of Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease. Furthermore, studies have shown that small molecule inhibitors targeting the BC complex exhibit promising therapeutic potential in delaying the progression of neurodegenerative disorders. These findings underscore the significance of the BC complex as a potential therapeutic target for interventions aimed at mitigating the impact of neurodegenerative diseases. Further research is warranted to elucidate the precise mechanisms underlying the involvement of the BC complex in neurodegeneration and to develop targeted therapies for these debilitating conditions.
