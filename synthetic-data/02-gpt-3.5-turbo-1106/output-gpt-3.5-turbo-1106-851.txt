prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: BUR kinase. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we investigated the functional role of the BUR kinase protein complex in the context of osteosarcoma pathogenesis. Using osteosarcoma cell lines and xenograft models in mice, we demonstrated that inhibition of BUR kinase activity led to a significant decrease in tumor growth and metastasis. Furthermore, through gene expression profiling and functional assays, we identified a novel signaling pathway involving BUR kinase that promotes osteosarcoma progression. Our findings suggest that targeting the BUR kinase complex may represent a promising therapeutic strategy for the treatment of osteosarcoma. This research has important implications for the development of targeted therapies aimed at disrupting the activity of the BUR kinase complex in osteosarcoma and possibly other cancer types.
