prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: box H/ACA RNP. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: Box H/ACA ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complexes play a critical role in the maturation and stability of ribosomal RNA (rRNA). These complexes have been implicated in various human diseases, including dyskeratosis congenita, a rare inherited disorder characterized by bone marrow failure, pulmonary fibrosis, and abnormal skin pigmentation. Recent studies have revealed the association of box H/ACA RNP with telomerase biogenesis, suggesting a potential link between defective box H/ACA RNP function and telomere maintenance in the context of age-related diseases such as cancer and aging-associated pathologies. Understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying the function of box H/ACA RNP complexes may provide valuable insights into the pathogenesis of these diseases and potentially offer new therapeutic targets for intervention.
