prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: axonemal dynein heavy chain. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The axonemal dynein heavy chain has been implicated in various genetic disorders, including primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD), a hereditary disease characterized by impaired ciliary structure and function. Recent studies have shown a correlation between mutations in the axonemal dynein heavy chain gene and the development of PCD in affected individuals. Furthermore, the axonemal dynein heavy chain has been found to interact with microtubules within the ciliary axoneme, suggesting a role in ciliary motility and function. Understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying axonemal dynein heavy chain dysfunction may provide critical insights into the pathogenesis of PCD and inform the development of potential therapeutic strategies for this debilitating condition.
