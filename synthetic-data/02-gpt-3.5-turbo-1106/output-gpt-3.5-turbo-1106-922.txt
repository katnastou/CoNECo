prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: IFT-B. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: Recent studies have highlighted the crucial role of the intraflagellar transport B (IFT-B) complex in the assembly and maintenance of primary cilia, which are essential for cell signaling and sensory functions. The IFT-B complex is composed of multiple subunits and has been found to play a critical role in the transport of ciliary proteins along the axoneme. Dysregulation of IFT-B complex function has been associated with a spectrum of ciliopathies, including Bardet-Biedl syndrome and Joubert syndrome, characterized by a range of clinical manifestations such as retinal degeneration, renal anomalies, and developmental delay. Understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying the assembly and function of the IFT-B complex holds promise for the development of targeted therapeutic strategies for ciliopathies and related disorders.
