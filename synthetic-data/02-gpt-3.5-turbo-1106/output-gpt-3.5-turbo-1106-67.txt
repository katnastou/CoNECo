prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: HEX B. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we investigated the role of the HEX B protein complex in lysosomal storage diseases, particularly in the context of Tay-Sachs and Sandhoff disease. We observed that the activity and stability of HEX B were significantly impacted by the accumulation of GM2 gangliosides in the lysosomes of affected individuals. Furthermore, our findings suggest a potential link between the dysregulation of HEX B and the progression of neurodegenerative symptoms in these disorders. Our results highlight the importance of further exploring the molecular mechanisms underlying the pathology of lysosomal storage diseases and the potential therapeutic interventions targeting the HEX B complex.
