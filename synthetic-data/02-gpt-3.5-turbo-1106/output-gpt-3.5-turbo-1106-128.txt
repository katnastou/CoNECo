prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: AHAS. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The acetohydroxy acid synthase (AHAS) protein complex plays a crucial role in the biosynthetic pathway of branched-chain amino acids in plants and bacteria. This complex is the molecular target of certain herbicidal compounds, such as sulfonylureas and imidazolinones, which are widely used in agriculture to control weed growth. In recent years, the emergence of AHAS mutations in various weed species has raised concerns about herbicide resistance and the potential impact on crop yields. Understanding the structural and functional properties of AHAS and its interactions with herbicidal compounds is essential for the development of effective weed management strategies. Additionally, studying the regulation of AHAS expression and activity in response to environmental factors and stress conditions could provide valuable insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying plant adaptation and resilience.
