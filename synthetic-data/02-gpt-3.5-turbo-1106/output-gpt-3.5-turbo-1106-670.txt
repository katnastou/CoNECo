prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: TRanscription/EXport. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The TRanscription/EXport (TREX) complex is a critical mediator for the efficient export of fully processed mRNAs from the nucleus to the cytoplasm in eukaryotic cells. Recent studies have suggested a potential role for the TREX complex in the regulation of alternative splicing, as well as its involvement in cellular responses to stress. Furthermore, dysregulation of TREX complex activity has been implicated in several human diseases, including viral infections and cancer. The molecular mechanism underlying the assembly and function of the TREX complex has been the focus of extensive research, and a better understanding of its role in mRNA export and gene expression regulation may offer new insights into the development of targeted therapies for diseases associated with its dysfunction.
