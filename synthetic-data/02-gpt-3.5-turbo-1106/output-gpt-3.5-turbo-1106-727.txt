prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: gamma-secretase. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: A hallmark event in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the dysregulation of the gamma-secretase complex. This integral membrane protein complex, consisting of presenilin, nicastrin, Aph-1, and Pen-2, is responsible for the proteolytic cleavage of amyloid precursor protein, releasing amyloid beta peptides. The altered activity of gamma-secretase has been implicated in the accumulation of neurotoxic amyloid beta aggregates, leading to neurodegeneration characteristic of AD. Recent investigations have highlighted the potential of small molecule inhibitors targeting gamma-secretase as a promising therapeutic avenue for ameliorating disease progression. Understanding the intricate regulatory mechanisms governing the functionality of this protein complex is crucial for the development of effective interventions aimed at mitigating the devastating impact of AD.
