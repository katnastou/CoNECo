prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: CENP-T-W-S-X. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we investigated the role of the CENP-T-W-S-X protein complex in the progression of breast cancer. Our investigation revealed a significant association between high expression levels of CENP-T-W-S-X and the aggressiveness of breast cancer tumors. Furthermore, we identified a novel small molecule inhibitor that effectively disrupts the interaction between CENP-T-W-S-X and its target protein, resulting in a significant reduction in the growth and metastatic potential of breast cancer cells in preclinical models. These findings highlight the potential of targeting CENP-T-W-S-X as a therapeutic strategy for treating aggressive breast cancer. This study provides valuable insights into the mechanistic underpinnings of CENP-T-W-S-X in breast cancer progression and lays the foundation for further exploration of targeted therapies against this protein complex.
