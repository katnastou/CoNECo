prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: Clr6 histone deacetylase complex II. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The Clr6 histone deacetylase complex II is a crucial player in the maintenance of chromatin structure and gene regulation. Studies have demonstrated its association with the pathogenesis of various diseases, including cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, and developmental abnormalities. The complex's role in cellular processes, such as DNA repair, cell cycle regulation, and apoptosis, underscores its significance in normal physiology and disease pathology. Further investigation into the molecular mechanisms underlying the function and regulation of Clr6 histone deacetylase complex II promises to yield valuable insights for therapeutic interventions targeting its dysregulation in disease states.
