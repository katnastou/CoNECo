prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: replisome. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we investigated the role of the replisome in the replication of DNA during cancer progression. The replisome, a multi-subunit protein complex involved in DNA synthesis, plays a critical role in ensuring accurate and efficient DNA replication. Using a mouse model of colorectal cancer, we observed dysregulation of the replisome in tumor cells compared to healthy tissue. Further characterization of replisome activity revealed aberrant protein interactions and altered enzymatic functions, suggesting potential implications for genomic instability. Our findings underscore the significance of the replisome in cancer pathogenesis and highlight its potential as a therapeutic target for intervention in disrupted DNA replication mechanisms.
