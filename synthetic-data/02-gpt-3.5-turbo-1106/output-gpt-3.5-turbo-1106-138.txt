prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: fibrinogen gamma chain. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we investigated the role of the fibrinogen gamma chain in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular disease. By analyzing fibrinogen gamma chain levels in a cohort of patients with a history of myocardial infarction, we found a positive correlation between elevated fibrinogen gamma chain levels and increased risk of recurrent thrombotic events. Furthermore, in a mouse model of atherosclerosis, we observed that genetic knockout of the fibrinogen gamma chain led to decreased atherosclerotic lesion formation and reduced plaque instability. Our findings suggest that targeting the fibrinogen gamma chain may offer a promising therapeutic strategy for mitigating thrombotic complications in cardiovascular disease.
