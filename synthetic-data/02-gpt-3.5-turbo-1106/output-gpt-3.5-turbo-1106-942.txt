prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: HULC. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In recent years, the long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) HULC has emerged as a pivotal molecule in multiple facets of cancer biology. Numerous studies have linked HULC with the progression and metastasis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), the most common type of primary liver cancer. Additionally, HULC has been implicated in the modulation of chemoresistance, with its overexpression showing an association with decreased sensitivity to chemotherapeutic agents in HCC. Moreover, HULC expression has been observed to act as a molecular switch in the regulation of glucose metabolism, thereby potentially influencing the metabolic reprogramming commonly observed in cancer cells. These findings highlight the significance of HULC as a potential target for therapeutic interventions in HCC and underscore its involvement in the intricate network of molecular events driving cancer progression. Further investigations into elucidating the precise mechanisms underlying HULC's diverse roles in cancer pathogenesis are warranted and may provide valuable insights into the development of novel treatment strategies for HCC and potentially other cancer types.
