prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: SWI/SNF-A. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we aimed to investigate the role of the SWI/SNF-A protein complex in the pathogenesis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). HCC is a primary liver cancer associated with high mortality and limited treatment options. Through comprehensive proteomic analysis, we identified dysregulation of SWI/SNF-A in HCC tissues compared to adjacent non-tumor liver tissues. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the expression levels of SWI/SNF-A correlate with disease progression and patient survival. Mechanistically, we found that the dysregulated SWI/SNF-A complex contributes to aberrant chromatin remodeling and altered gene expression patterns in HCC cells. These findings shed light on the potential therapeutic targeting of SWI/SNF-A in the treatment of HCC, offering new insights into the molecular pathogenesis of this aggressive malignancy.
