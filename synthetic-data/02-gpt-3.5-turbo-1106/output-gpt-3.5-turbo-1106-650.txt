prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: MsbA transporter. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The MsbA transporter has been extensively studied for its crucial role in bacterial multidrug resistance. This ABC transporter is responsible for the active efflux of a wide range of antibiotics and lipid A precursors, conferring resistance to Gram-negative bacteria. Recent research has highlighted the potential of small molecule inhibitors to reverse the multidrug resistance phenotype mediated by the MsbA transporter. Understanding the interplay between the unique structure and function of this transporter and its role in drug resistance mechanisms is essential for the development of novel antibacterial strategies. Moreover, elucidating the impact of specific chemical compounds on the activity of the MsbA transporter may hold promise for combating multidrug-resistant bacterial infections and improving treatment outcomes for affected patients.
