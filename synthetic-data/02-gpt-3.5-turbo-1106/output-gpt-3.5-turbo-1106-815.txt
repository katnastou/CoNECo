prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: IgW immunoglobulin. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The IgW immunoglobulin is a unique protein complex found in cartilaginous fish, including sharks and rays. This complex has been studied extensively due to its potential role in the immune response of these organisms. Recent research has focused on the interaction between IgW immunoglobulin and viral pathogens, particularly its role in providing protection against infectious diseases. Understanding the structure and function of the IgW immunoglobulin is of great interest for the development of novel therapeutic interventions targeting viral infections in cartilaginous fish. Furthermore, investigating the evolutionary implications of the IgW immunoglobulin may provide valuable insights into the adaptive immune system of these ancient organisms.
