prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: MKS. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In recent years, there has been increasing interest in the role of the MKS protein complex in the pathophysiology of ciliopathies, such as Meckel-Gruber syndrome and Joubert syndrome. The MKS protein complex is an essential regulator of primary cilia formation and function, and its dysregulation has been linked to a wide range of developmental abnormalities and disease phenotypes. Recent studies have highlighted the intricate network of interactions between the MKS protein complex and other key signaling pathways, including the hedgehog and Wnt signaling cascades. Furthermore, the identification of small molecule modulators targeting the MKS protein complex has shown promise in preclinical models, suggesting potential avenues for therapeutic intervention in ciliopathy-associated disorders. Further investigation into the molecular mechanisms underlying MKS protein complex function and its dysregulation in disease may provide valuable insights for the development of novel therapeutic strategies.
