prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: syntrophin. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we investigated the role of the protein complex syntrophin in the pathogenesis of Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). We employed a mouse model of DMD to examine the interaction between syntrophin and dystrophin, the absence of which is a hallmark of DMD. Our findings revealed that the disruption of syntrophin-dystrophin signaling contributes to the progression of muscle degeneration in DMD. Furthermore, our data indicated that pharmacological modulation of syntrophin function may represent a potential therapeutic strategy for DMD. These results provide novel insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying DMD pathology and suggest syntrophin as a promising target for therapeutic intervention.
