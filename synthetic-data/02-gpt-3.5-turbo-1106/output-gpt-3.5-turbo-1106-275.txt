prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: IL23A. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we investigated the role of the IL23A protein complex in the pathogenesis of psoriasis, a chronic inflammatory skin disorder. Using a murine model of psoriasis, we demonstrated a significant upregulation of IL23A expression in the affected skin tissue. Furthermore, treatment with a small molecule inhibitor targeting the IL23A complex resulted in a substantial reduction in disease severity, as evidenced by decreased epidermal hyperplasia and inflammatory cell infiltration. Our findings suggest that targeting the IL23A complex may represent a promising therapeutic approach for the management of psoriasis and other related inflammatory conditions. This research provides valuable insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying psoriasis and highlights the potential for IL23A inhibitory strategies in clinical management.
