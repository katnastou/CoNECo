prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: MutSbeta. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In recent years, there has been growing interest in understanding the role of the MutSbeta protein complex in the pathogenesis of Lynch syndrome, a hereditary predisposition to colorectal cancer. MutSbeta is known for its involvement in DNA mismatch repair, and mutations in its encoding genes have been associated with increased cancer risk in affected individuals. Several studies have investigated the interaction between MutSbeta and various DNA lesions, including those caused by environmental factors such as UV radiation and chemical mutagens. These findings shed light on the mechanisms underlying the development of Lynch syndrome and provide potential targets for therapeutic interventions aimed at mitigating the risk of colorectal cancer in affected individuals.
