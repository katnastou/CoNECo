prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: RSF. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The RSF protein complex has been implicated in the regulation of chromatin structure and gene expression. Recent studies have demonstrated a direct link between RSF and the progression of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), with increased expression of RSF correlating with tumor growth and metastasis. Furthermore, the interaction between RSF and specific transcription factors has been shown to play a critical role in the maintenance of pluripotency in embryonic stem cells. The dysregulation of RSF expression has also been associated with inflammatory bowel disease, highlighting its diverse roles in human health and disease. Understanding the molecular mechanisms underpinning the function of the RSF complex may offer new insights into the development of targeted therapies for HCC and other RSF-associated pathologies.
