prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: PS1. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: Alzheimer's disease is a devastating neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the progressive loss of memory and cognitive impairment. The etiology of this disease involves the dysregulation of amyloid-β peptide production and its subsequent accumulation in the brains of affected individuals. Proteolytic processing of amyloid precursor protein (APP) by γ-secretase, a membrane-bound protease complex, is a key step in the generation of amyloid-β peptides. Presenilin 1 (PS1), a critical component of the γ-secretase complex, has been implicated in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease. Mutations in the PS1 gene are known to increase the production of pathogenic amyloid-β peptides, leading to the early onset of familial Alzheimer's disease. Understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying the role of PS1 in amyloid-β production is crucial for the development of targeted therapeutic interventions for Alzheimer's disease.
