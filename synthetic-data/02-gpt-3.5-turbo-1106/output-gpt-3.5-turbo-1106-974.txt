prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: SPC. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we investigated the role of the SPC complex in the pathogenesis of autoimmune disease. We conducted a series of experiments using a murine model of systemic lupus erythematosus and found a significant upregulation of SPC expression in the affected tissues. Furthermore, our analysis revealed a direct association between the activity of SPC and the progression of autoimmune symptoms in the animal model. Through pharmacological intervention targeting the SPC complex, we were able to mitigate the severity of the disease manifestations, indicating a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of autoimmune disorders. These findings shed light on the intricate involvement of SPC in the pathophysiology of autoimmune diseases and provide insights into the development of novel treatment strategies.
