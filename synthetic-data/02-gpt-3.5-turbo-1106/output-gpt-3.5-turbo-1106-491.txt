prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: Polymerase-zeta. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The role of Polymerase-zeta (Pol-zeta), a specialized DNA polymerase complex, in the cellular response to DNA damage has been under extensive investigation. Recent studies have focused on elucidating the interaction of Pol-zeta with various DNA lesions induced by chemical carcinogens such as benzo[a]pyrene, as well as mutagenic agents like ultraviolet radiation. Furthermore, the association of Pol-zeta with human diseases such as xeroderma pigmentosum and Fanconi anemia has uncovered its crucial function in maintaining genomic stability. This research sheds light on the potential therapeutic strategies targeting Pol-zeta to mitigate the effects of DNA damage and combat carcinogenesis in human populations.
