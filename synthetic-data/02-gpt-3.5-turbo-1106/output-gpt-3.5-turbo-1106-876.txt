prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: BDC. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we investigated the role of the BDC protein complex in the pathogenesis of diabetes in a murine model. Our results demonstrate a significant upregulation of BDC in pancreatic islet cells of diabetic mice compared to non-diabetic controls. Moreover, treatment with a specific inhibitor of BDC led to a reduction in hyperglycemia and improved glucose tolerance in the diabetic mice. Interestingly, we also observed a correlation between BDC expression and the level of pro-inflammatory cytokines in the pancreatic tissue. Our findings suggest that BDC may play a pivotal role in the regulation of inflammatory processes associated with diabetes. Further investigations into the molecular mechanisms underlying the involvement of BDC in diabetes may provide novel therapeutic targets for the management of this debilitating disease.
