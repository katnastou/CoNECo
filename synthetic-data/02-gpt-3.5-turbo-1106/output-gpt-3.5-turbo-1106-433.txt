prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: VHL. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: Recent studies have revealed the critical role of the von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) protein complex in the regulation of hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) signaling in various cancers. Dysregulation of this complex has been implicated in the pathogenesis of clear cell renal cell carcinoma and other VHL-associated tumors. Furthermore, small molecule inhibitors targeting the VHL complex have shown promise as potential therapeutic agents for these malignancies. Additionally, investigations into the underlying molecular mechanisms governing the interaction between the VHL complex and HIF have illuminated new avenues for the development of novel cancer treatments. Further exploration of the VHL protein complex and its implications for cancer biology holds great promise for the advancement of targeted therapies in the clinical setting.
