prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: axonemal dynein. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we investigated the role of axonemal dynein in ciliary function in the context of primary ciliary dyskinesia. Using a combination of genetic knockout models and pharmacological inhibitors, we found that axonemal dynein plays a crucial role in regulating ciliary beat frequency and mucociliary clearance in the airways. Furthermore, we observed aberrant ciliary motility and impaired mucus clearance in mutant mice lacking functional axonemal dynein, leading to the development of chronic respiratory infections. Our findings highlight the essential role of axonemal dynein in maintaining proper ciliary function and provide insights into the pathophysiology of primary ciliary dyskinesia. These results have important implications for the development of targeted therapeutics for respiratory diseases associated with ciliary dysfunction.
