prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: PBAF. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In recent years, the role of the PBAF protein complex in cancer biology has garnered significant attention. PBAF, a key player in chromatin remodeling and gene expression regulation, has been implicated in various cancer types, including lung adenocarcinoma and breast carcinoma. Interestingly, studies have linked the dysregulation of PBAF to tumor progression and metastasis, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target. Furthermore, the interaction of PBAF with epigenetic modifiers such as histone acetyltransferases and DNA methyltransferases underscores its multifaceted impact on cellular processes. Given its involvement in oncogenesis, further investigation into the molecular mechanisms underlying PBAF function may yield novel insights into cancer development and treatment modalities.
