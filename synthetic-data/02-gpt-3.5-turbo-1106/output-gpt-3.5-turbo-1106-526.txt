prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: Adapter complex AP-3. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The Adapter complex AP-3 (AP-3) is a key player in the intracellular trafficking of membrane proteins in eukaryotic cells. It has been demonstrated that mutations in the AP-3 subunits can lead to Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome, a disorder characterized by hypopigmentation, bleeding diathesis, and ceroid lipofuscin deposition in various tissues. Additionally, studies have shown that AP-3 is involved in the transport of neurotransmitter receptors in neurons, contributing to synaptic transmission and plasticity. Given its crucial role in cellular trafficking and its implication in human diseases, a thorough understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying AP-3 function is imperative for the development of targeted therapies for disorders associated with its dysfunction.
