prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: succinic dehydrogenase. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The role of succinic dehydrogenase in the pathophysiology of Parkinson's disease has garnered significant attention in recent years. Studies have shown that alterations in the activity and expression of succinic dehydrogenase are associated with mitochondrial dysfunction and increased oxidative stress, contributing to the degeneration of dopaminergic neurons. Furthermore, the dysregulation of succinic dehydrogenase has been implicated in the disruption of the tricarboxylic acid cycle, leading to impaired energy production and the accumulation of reactive oxygen species. Modulating the activity of succinic dehydrogenase presents a promising target for therapeutic intervention in Parkinson's disease, offering potential avenues for the development of novel treatment strategies to mitigate neuronal damage and disease progression.
