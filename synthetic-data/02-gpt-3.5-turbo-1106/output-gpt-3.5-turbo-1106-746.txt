prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: LINC. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we investigated the role of the LINC protein complex in the pathogenesis of osteoporosis. Osteoporosis is a common disorder characterized by reduced bone mineral density and an increased risk of fractures. Previous studies have suggested a potential link between LINC and bone remodeling, prompting our investigation into the molecular mechanisms involved. We utilized a mouse model of osteoporosis and found that inhibition of the LINC complex resulted in exacerbated bone loss and decreased bone strength. Furthermore, our data indicated that LINC complex disruption led to dysregulation of osteoclast and osteoblast activity, key cell types involved in bone resorption and formation. These findings highlight the potential of targeting the LINC complex as a therapeutic strategy for managing osteoporosis and related bone disorders.
