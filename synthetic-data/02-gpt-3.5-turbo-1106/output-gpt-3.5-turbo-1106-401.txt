prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: gamma-delta TCR. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The gamma-delta TCR protein complex has been implicated in the modulation of immune responses in the context of various diseases, including cancer and autoimmune disorders. Studies have indicated a potential role for the gamma-delta TCR complex in recognizing and responding to non-peptide antigens, which could have broad implications for immunotherapy and vaccine development. Furthermore, recent research has highlighted the significance of this protein complex in mediating immune surveillance and immunoregulatory functions in both mice and humans. These findings underscore the importance of further investigating the molecular mechanisms and functional significance of the gamma-delta TCR complex in immune-related diseases and therapeutic interventions.
