prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: PA28. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The 11S regulator PA28 is a well-characterized protein complex involved in the regulation of antigen presentation within the cellular immune response. Studies have shown that the PA28 complex plays a critical role in the processing and presentation of antigens to major histocompatibility complex class I molecules. Furthermore, evidence has indicated that the activity of the PA28 complex is significantly impacted by post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation and acetylation. Dysregulation of PA28 expression and function has been associated with several autoimmune conditions, including rheumatoid arthritis and type 1 diabetes. Understanding the molecular mechanisms governing the activity of the PA28 complex may offer valuable insights into the pathogenesis of these diseases and provide potential therapeutic targets for intervention.
