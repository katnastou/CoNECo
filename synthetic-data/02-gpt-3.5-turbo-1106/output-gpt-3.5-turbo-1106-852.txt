prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: CENP-A containing nucleosome. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The CENP-A containing nucleosome is a critical component in ensuring proper chromosomal segregation and stability during cell division. Recent studies have highlighted the essential role of this protein complex in governing kinetochore assembly and microtubule attachment, both of which are indispensable for maintaining genomic integrity. Dysregulation of CENP-A containing nucleosome has been implicated in various human diseases, including cancer and developmental disorders. Understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying the assembly and regulation of this protein complex is crucial for elucidating the pathogenesis of these conditions, and may offer potential therapeutic targets for intervention. Moreover, the identification of small molecule modulators that specifically target the CENP-A containing nucleosome could provide valuable tools for studying its function and for the development of novel treatment strategies for diseases associated with its malfunction.
