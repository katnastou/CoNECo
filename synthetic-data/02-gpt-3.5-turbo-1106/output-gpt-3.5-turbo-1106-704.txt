prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: matrilin. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: Recent studies have suggested that the matrilin protein complex may play a significant role in the pathogenesis of osteoarthritis, particularly in the regulation of cartilage homeostasis. Osteoarthritis, a degenerative joint disease characterized by progressive loss of cartilage, is a major health concern worldwide. In an experimental model of osteoarthritis, disruption of the matrilin complex led to accelerated cartilage degradation and increased joint inflammation. Furthermore, analysis of human cartilage samples from osteoarthritis patients revealed alterations in the abundance and localization of matrilin within the extracellular matrix. These findings indicate the potential involvement of the matrilin protein complex in the development and progression of osteoarthritis, highlighting its candidacy as a therapeutic target for the management of this debilitating condition.
