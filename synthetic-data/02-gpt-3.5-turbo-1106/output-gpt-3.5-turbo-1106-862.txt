prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: collagen type III trimer. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we investigated the role of the collagen type III trimer in the pathogenesis of aortic aneurysms. Aortic aneurysms are characterized by the weakening and dilation of the aortic wall, leading to potentially life-threatening complications. Our findings revealed a significant increase in the expression of collagen type III trimer in the aortic tissues of individuals with aortic aneurysms compared to healthy controls. Furthermore, we observed a positive correlation between the levels of collagen type III trimer and the progression of aortic dilation in a murine model of the disease. These results suggest a potential association between collagen type III trimer and the development of aortic aneurysms, highlighting its potential as a biomarker for disease progression and a potential therapeutic target for future interventions.
