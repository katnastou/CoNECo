prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: APOBEC. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: A growing body of evidence has implicated the APOBEC protein complex in the development of various cancers, including breast, lung, and cervical cancer. The complex is known to play a critical role in the deamination of cytosine residues within DNA, contributing to mutagenesis and genomic instability. Additionally, dysregulation of APOBEC has been associated with the acquisition of drug resistance in certain malignancies. Studies have also suggested a potential link between APOBEC and viral infections, such as HIV and hepatitis B, underscoring the diverse implications of this complex in both oncogenesis and infectious disease. Understanding the mechanisms by which APOBEC modulates genetic alterations may provide valuable insights into the pathogenesis of cancer and aid in the development of novel therapeutic strategies targeting this complex.
