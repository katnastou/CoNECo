prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: Nup82. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The Nup82 protein complex has been shown to play a pivotal role in regulating nuclear pore complex (NPC) function and maintaining proper nuclear-cytoplasmic transport in eukaryotic organisms. Research has demonstrated that disruptions in the assembly or composition of the Nup82 complex can result in aberrant nucleocytoplasmic transport, leading to various cellular dysfunctions. Additionally, studies have revealed that the Nup82 complex interacts with multiple nucleoporins and nuclear transport factors, highlighting its involvement in mediating the transport of macromolecules across the nuclear envelope. Dysregulation of the Nup82 complex has also been associated with various human diseases, including certain types of cancers and neurodegenerative disorders, underscoring the clinical significance of understanding its molecular mechanisms and potential therapeutic implications.
