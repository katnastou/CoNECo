prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: ASTRA. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The ASTRA protein complex has been implicated in a variety of cellular processes, including cell cycle regulation, DNA damage response, and chromatin organization. Recent studies have shown that ASTRA plays a crucial role in maintaining genomic stability and preventing the accumulation of DNA damage. Dysregulation of ASTRA has been associated with increased susceptibility to chromosomal instability and tumorigenesis. Furthermore, dysfunctions in ASTRA have been observed in various cancer types, such as breast cancer and colorectal cancer. Understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying ASTRA function may provide insights into the development of novel therapeutic strategies targeting genomic instability and cancer progression. The study of ASTRA in model organisms, such as Caenorhabditis elegans and Drosophila melanogaster, has provided valuable information on the conserved nature of ASTRA function across different species, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target in human diseases.
