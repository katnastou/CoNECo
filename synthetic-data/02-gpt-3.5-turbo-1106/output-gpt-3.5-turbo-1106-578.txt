prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: APC/C. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C) is a vital regulator of cell cycle progression, playing a crucial role in the degradation of key cell cycle regulators. Emerging evidence suggests that dysregulation of the APC/C may contribute to the pathogenesis of various human diseases, including cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, and developmental abnormalities. Moreover, the APC/C is known to interact with a diverse array of proteins, including cyclins, kinases, and ubiquitin ligases, highlighting its central role in coordinating multiple cellular processes. Understanding the mechanisms governing APC/C activity and regulation is essential for elucidating its broader impact on human health and disease, and may pave the way for the development of targeted therapeutic strategies.
