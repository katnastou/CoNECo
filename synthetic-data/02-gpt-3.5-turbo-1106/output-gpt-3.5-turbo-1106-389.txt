prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: RSA. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The role of the RSA protein complex in the pathogenesis of breast cancer has been an area of increasing interest and investigation. Previous studies have implicated RSA in the regulation of cell proliferation and survival, particularly in the context of estrogen receptor (ER) positive breast cancer. Here, we report the identification of a novel small molecule inhibitor that specifically targets the interaction between RSA and its binding partner, leading to inhibition of tumor growth in preclinical models. Additionally, analysis of patient samples revealed upregulation of RSA expression in ER-positive breast cancer, suggesting a potential prognostic and predictive value of this protein complex in the clinic. These findings highlight the potential therapeutic significance of targeting the RSA complex as a novel strategy for the treatment of ER-positive breast cancer.
