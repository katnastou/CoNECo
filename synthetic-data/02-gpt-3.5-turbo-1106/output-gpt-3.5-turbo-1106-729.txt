prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: IgG4. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we aimed to investigate the role of the IgG4 protein complex in the pathogenesis of autoimmune pancreatitis. Utilizing a cohort of patients with confirmed autoimmune pancreatitis, we assessed the levels of IgG4 in serum samples and evaluated its correlation with disease severity. Additionally, we performed immunohistochemical analysis of pancreatic tissue from these patients to determine the localization and distribution of IgG4. Our results indicate a significant elevation of IgG4 levels in the serum of patients with autoimmune pancreatitis compared to controls, suggesting a potential diagnostic biomarker for this disease. Moreover, the presence of IgG4-positive plasma cells in pancreatic tissue supports the involvement of the IgG4 protein complex in the immune response underlying autoimmune pancreatitis. Further research is warranted to elucidate the specific role of IgG4 in the pathophysiology of this condition and its potential as a therapeutic target.
