prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: IL-12 receptor. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The IL-12 receptor plays a crucial role in mediating immune responses to pathogens and tumors, making it a potential target for immunotherapy. Previous studies have demonstrated that the binding of IL-12 to its receptor complex induces the activation of various immune cells, leading to the production of interferon gamma and other pro-inflammatory cytokines. Dysregulation of the IL-12 receptor signaling has been implicated in several autoimmune diseases, such as Crohn's disease and psoriasis, highlighting the therapeutic potential of targeting this pathway. Moreover, IL-12 receptor deficiency has been associated with an increased susceptibility to certain intracellular infections, emphasizing the importance of a functional IL-12 receptor in host defense against microbial pathogens. Further research into the signaling mechanisms and regulation of the IL-12 receptor complex could provide valuable insights for the development of novel therapeutic strategies for immune-related disorders and infectious diseases.
