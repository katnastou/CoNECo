prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: alphav-beta5 integrin. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: Recent studies have elucidated the crucial role of the alphav-beta5 integrin in the progression of metastatic cancer. This protein complex has been implicated in facilitating tumor cell migration and invasion within the tumor microenvironment, leading to the development of distant metastases. In addition, interactions between the alphav-beta5 integrin and extracellular matrix components, such as fibronectin and vitronectin, have been shown to promote angiogenesis, further enhancing tumor growth and dissemination. Targeting the alphav-beta5 integrin signaling pathway has emerged as a promising therapeutic strategy for inhibiting metastatic spread and improving patient outcomes in aggressive cancer types, including pancreatic adenocarcinoma and melanoma. Harnessing the specificity of alphav-beta5 integrin inhibitors holds potential for the development of novel anti-cancer agents with reduced off-target effects. These findings underscore the significance of further investigating the molecular mechanisms underlying alphav-beta5 integrin-mediated tumor progression, with the ultimate goal of identifying effective interventions to combat metastatic disease.
