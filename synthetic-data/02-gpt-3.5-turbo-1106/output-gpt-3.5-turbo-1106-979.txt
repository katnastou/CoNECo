prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: RNAPIII. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The RNAPIII protein complex plays a crucial role in the transcription of transfer RNAs and other small non-coding RNAs in eukaryotic cells. Dysregulation of RNAPIII activity has been associated with a variety of human diseases, including neurological disorders, cancer, and developmental abnormalities. Several studies have suggested a potential link between altered expression or function of specific components of the RNAPIII complex and disease pathogenesis. Furthermore, small molecule inhibitors targeting the activity of RNAPIII have shown promise as potential therapeutic agents for certain cancer types. Therefore, a comprehensive understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying RNAPIII regulation and function is essential for the development of novel therapeutic strategies targeting RNAPIII-associated diseases.
