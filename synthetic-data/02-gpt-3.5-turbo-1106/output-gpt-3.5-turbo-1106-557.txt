prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: LH1. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The role of the LH1 protein complex in the pathogenesis of age-related macular degeneration (AMD) has been a topic of intense investigation in recent years. In a recent study, researchers utilized a novel high-throughput screening approach to identify small molecule modulators of LH1 activity in retinal pigmented epithelial cells. Through this screening, the team identified a potent inhibitor of LH1, which effectively reduced the accumulation of drusen and attenuated the progression of AMD in a mouse model. These findings suggest that targeting the LH1 protein complex may represent a promising therapeutic strategy for the treatment of AMD and other retinal degenerative diseases. Further studies are warranted to elucidate the precise mechanism of action of LH1 and to optimize the therapeutic potential of LH1 inhibitors for clinical applications.
