prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: vacuolar HOPS. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: Vacuolar HOPS is a highly conserved hetero-hexameric tethering complex critical for endolysosomal membrane fusion. This multi-subunit complex consists of Vps11, Vps16, Vps18, Vps33, Vps39, and Vps41, and plays a crucial role in vesicular traffic and protein sorting within the endosomal system. Dysfunction of the vacuolar HOPS complex has been linked to various lysosomal storage disorders, including Danon disease and mucolipidosis type IV. Furthermore, recent studies have highlighted the potential involvement of vacuolar HOPS in autophagy regulation and immune response modulation. Given its central role in intracellular transport and vesicle fusion, the vacuolar HOPS complex represents an attractive therapeutic target for the treatment of various lysosomal storage and related diseases.
