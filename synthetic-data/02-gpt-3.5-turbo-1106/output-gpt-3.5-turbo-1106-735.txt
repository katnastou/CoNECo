prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: LinE. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The LinE protein complex has been implicated in the regulation of cell cycle progression and its potential role in cancer biology is an area of active investigation. Recent studies have demonstrated that dysregulation of LinE may contribute to the pathogenesis of certain types of cancer, including melanoma and breast cancer. Additionally, the complex has been shown to interact with key signaling pathways, such as the MAPK/ERK pathway, providing insights into its broader cellular functions. Furthermore, small molecule inhibitors targeting LinE have shown promising results in preclinical studies, suggesting that it may be a potential therapeutic target for cancer treatment. Further research into the molecular mechanisms and biological functions of LinE is warranted to fully elucidate its impact on disease pathology and therapeutic potential.
