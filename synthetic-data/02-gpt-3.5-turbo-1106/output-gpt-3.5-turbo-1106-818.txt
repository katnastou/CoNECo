prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: inhibin A. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: Inhibin A, a heterodimeric glycoprotein complex, has garnered significant attention in the field of reproductive endocrinology due to its critical role in regulating follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) secretion from the anterior pituitary gland. Alterations in inhibin A levels have been implicated in various reproductive disorders, including polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), ovarian cancer, and premature ovarian failure. Additionally, the imbalance between inhibin A and activin has been suggested to contribute to the pathogenesis of these conditions. Given its importance in reproductive physiology and potential clinical implications, there is a growing interest in further elucidating the molecular mechanisms underlying inhibin A regulation and its potential as a diagnostic and therapeutic target.
