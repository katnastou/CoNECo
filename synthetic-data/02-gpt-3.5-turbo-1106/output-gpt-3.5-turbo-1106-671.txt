prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: Sus. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The Sus protein complex has been demonstrated to play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), a chronic disorder characterized by intestinal inflammation and mucosal damage. Previous studies have shown a significant upregulation of Sus in the intestinal mucosa of IBD patients, suggesting its involvement in the dysregulated immune response and abnormal tissue repair processes underlying the disease. Furthermore, experimental manipulation of Sus expression in murine models has resulted in altered susceptibility to colitis, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target for IBD. Additionally, recent investigations have implicated dysbiosis of the gut microbiota in the regulation of Sus activity, providing insights into the intricate interplay between host immune response, microbial composition, and IBD pathogenesis. These findings underscore the significance of Sus in the intricate network of factors contributing to the development and progression of IBD, offering new avenues for targeted therapeutic interventions.
