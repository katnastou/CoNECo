prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: TAP. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we investigated the role of the TAP complex in the transport of antigenic peptides across the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane. Using a combination of biochemical assays and mutagenesis experiments, we demonstrated that the TAP complex plays a critical role in the presentation of peptide antigens to major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I molecules. Furthermore, we found that perturbation of TAP complex function resulted in impaired antigen presentation, leading to decreased cytotoxic T lymphocyte response. Our findings suggest that the TAP complex is essential for efficient immune surveillance and may have implications for the development of novel immunotherapies targeting the antigen processing pathway.
