prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: Rpd3S. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The chromatin remodeling complex Rpd3S is known to play a crucial role in the regulation of gene expression and chromatin structure in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Recent studies have implicated Rpd3S in the pathogenesis of various human diseases, including cancer and neurodevelopmental disorders. Through its histone deacetylase activity, Rpd3S has been shown to modulate the transcriptional landscape of key genes involved in cell proliferation and differentiation. Furthermore, dysregulation of Rpd3S has been linked to the aberrant epigenetic modifications associated with certain malignancies and neurodegenerative conditions. Understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying the function of Rpd3S may pave the way for targeted therapies aimed at manipulating its activity for therapeutic purposes.
