prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: SOSS. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In recent years, the DNA repair protein complex SOSS has been the focus of intense investigation due to its critical role in maintaining genomic integrity. Studies have shown that the SOSS complex is involved in the recognition and repair of DNA double-strand breaks, which are known to contribute to the development of various genetic disorders, including cancer. Moreover, dysregulation of the SOSS complex has been implicated in the pathogenesis of several neurodegenerative diseases, highlighting the importance of understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying its function. Further elucidation of the interactions between SOSS and other cellular components, as well as the development of small molecule modulators targeting this complex, may offer new therapeutic strategies for diseases associated with DNA damage and repair dysfunction.
