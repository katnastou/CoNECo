prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: PDHE1. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we investigated the role of the PDHE1 protein complex in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease. Through in vitro assays using human cell lines and in vivo studies in a mouse model of the disease, we observed a significant dysregulation of PDHE1 expression and activity in affected neuronal tissues. Furthermore, we found that the administration of a small molecule modulator of PDHE1 improved motor function and reduced neurodegeneration in the experimental animals. Our findings suggest that targeting the PDHE1 complex may have therapeutic implications for the treatment of Parkinson's disease and motivate further exploration of its molecular mechanisms and potential drug development efforts.
