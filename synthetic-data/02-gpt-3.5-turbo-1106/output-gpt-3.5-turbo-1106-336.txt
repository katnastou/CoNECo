prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: laminin-11. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: A key regulator of tissue organization and development, laminin-11 has garnered significant attention for its pivotal role in mediating cell adhesion and migration in various physiological contexts. Recent studies have implicated laminin-11 in the pathogenesis of certain genetic disorders, including muscular dystrophy and skin fragility syndromes, underscoring the importance of this protein complex in maintaining tissue integrity. Furthermore, exploration of laminin-11's interactions with integrins and diverse extracellular matrix components has shed light on its potential as a therapeutic target in wound healing and tissue repair. These findings highlight the multifaceted impact of laminin-11 in cellular physiology and disease pathogenesis, thereby underscoring its significance in the field of biomedicine.
