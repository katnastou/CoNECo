prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: eaf5/7/3. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The eaf5/7/3 protein complex has been implicated in various cellular functions and diseases, including cancer and neurodegenerative disorders. Previous studies have established the role of eaf5/7/3 in regulating the activity of key cellular pathways and modulating the expression of genes associated with tumorigenesis and neurodegeneration. Furthermore, the dysregulation of eaf5/7/3 has been linked to the development and progression of several disease states, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target. Additionally, the interaction partners and regulatory mechanisms governing the function of eaf5/7/3 remain an area of active investigation, with the aim of elucidating its precise role in disease pathology and identifying potential avenues for targeted intervention.
