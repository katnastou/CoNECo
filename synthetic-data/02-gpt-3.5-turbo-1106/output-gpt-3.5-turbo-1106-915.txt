prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: VCB. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we investigated the role of the VCB protein complex in the regulation of cellular proliferation in breast cancer cells. Our results revealed that the expression of VCB was significantly upregulated in breast cancer cell lines compared to normal breast epithelial cells. Furthermore, treatment with a specific inhibitor targeting the VCB complex resulted in a significant decrease in cell viability and induction of apoptosis in breast cancer cells, indicating a potential therapeutic target. Additionally, we observed a correlation between VCB expression levels and tumor size in a cohort of breast cancer patients, suggesting a potential prognostic significance of VCB in breast cancer progression. Overall, our findings highlight the potential of targeting the VCB protein complex as a novel therapeutic approach for breast cancer treatment.
