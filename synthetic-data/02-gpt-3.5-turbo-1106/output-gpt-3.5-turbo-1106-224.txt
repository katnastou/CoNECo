prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: NDH-I. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The NADH dehydrogenase I (NDH-I) complex is a critical component of the mitochondrial respiratory chain in eukaryotic organisms. It plays a pivotal role in electron transfer and proton translocation during oxidative phosphorylation, which is essential for ATP production and cellular energy metabolism. Dysregulation of NDH-I activity has been implicated in a variety of human diseases, including mitochondrial disorders and neurodegenerative conditions. Recent studies have focused on small molecule modulators of NDH-I to explore their potential therapeutic applications in mitigating mitochondrial dysfunction and associated pathologies. Further elucidation of the structure-function relationships and regulatory mechanisms of NDH-I will be instrumental in developing targeted interventions for disorders characterized by impaired mitochondrial function.
