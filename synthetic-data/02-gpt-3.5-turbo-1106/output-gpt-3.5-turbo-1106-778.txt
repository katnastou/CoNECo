prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: SOSS1. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The protein complex SOSS1 has garnered attention for its role in DNA repair processes. Recent studies have elucidated the intricate regulatory mechanisms governing the expression and activity of SOSS1 in response to DNA damage. Notably, the interaction between SOSS1 and key protein factors involved in the DNA damage response, such as ATM and ATR kinases, has been a focal point of investigation. These findings shed light on the potential implications of SOSS1 dysregulation in the context of cancer susceptibility and genomic instability. Moreover, the identification of small molecule modulators targeting SOSS1 holds promise for therapeutic interventions aimed at enhancing DNA repair efficiency and mitigating cellular sensitivity to genotoxic stress. Further exploration of the functional intricacies of SOSS1 could unveil novel avenues for the development of targeted therapies in the realm of genome maintenance and cancer treatment.
