prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: PEP-B. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In recent years, significant attention has been focused on the role of the PEP-B protein complex in regulating metabolic pathways and cellular homeostasis. In a study using a genetically modified mouse model, researchers found that deletion of the PEP-B gene resulted in pronounced phenotypic abnormalities, including increased susceptibility to diet-induced obesity and impaired glucose tolerance. Furthermore, targeted disruption of PEP-B expression in hepatocytes led to hepatic steatosis and altered expression of key enzymes involved in lipid metabolism. These findings shed light on the critical role of PEP-B in the regulation of energy metabolism and provide a potential target for therapeutic intervention in metabolic disorders such as non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. Further investigations into the molecular mechanisms underlying the function of the PEP-B complex are needed to fully elucidate its potential as a therapeutic target in metabolic diseases.
