prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: CORVET. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The endosomal protein complex CORVET has been reported to play a critical role in the regulation of intracellular membrane trafficking in yeast. Recent studies have linked CORVET to the trafficking and fusion of endosomes, as well as its involvement in the control of receptor recycling and degradation pathways. Mutations affecting CORVET function have been associated with impaired endosomal maturation and aberrant vesicular transport, leading to the disruption of cellular homeostasis. Furthermore, dysregulation of CORVET has been implicated in various human diseases, including neurodegenerative disorders and certain forms of cancer. Thus, a comprehensive understanding of CORVET's molecular mechanisms and its broader implications in cellular physiology and disease pathogenesis is of paramount importance for the development of novel therapeutic approaches targeting endosomal dysfunction.
