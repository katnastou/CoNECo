prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: 54S mitochondrial large ribosomal subunit. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we investigated the role of the 54S mitochondrial large ribosomal subunit in the pathogenesis of mitochondrial respiratory disorders. Using a rat model of mitochondrial dysfunction, we observed a significant reduction in the levels of the 54S mitochondrial large ribosomal subunit in the heart and skeletal muscle tissues. Furthermore, we identified a correlation between the severity of the respiratory phenotype and the expression levels of the 54S mitochondrial large ribosomal subunit. Our findings suggest that the 54S mitochondrial large ribosomal subunit may play a crucial role in the regulation of mitochondrial protein synthesis and assembly, and its dysregulation could contribute to the development of mitochondrial respiratory disorders. This study sheds light on the potential therapeutic targets for the treatment of these debilitating conditions.
