prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: mu-calpain. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we aimed to investigate the role of mu-calpain in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease. We utilized a transgenic mouse model overexpressing mutant amyloid precursor protein to examine the activity of mu-calpain in the hippocampus. Our findings revealed a significant increase in mu-calpain activity in the hippocampal neurons of transgenic mice compared to wild-type controls. Additionally, we observed a positive correlation between mu-calpain activity and the accumulation of amyloid-beta plaques in the hippocampus. Furthermore, pharmacological inhibition of mu-calpain activity resulted in reduced neuroinflammatory responses and improved cognitive function in the transgenic mice. These results highlight the potential of targeting mu-calpain as a novel therapeutic strategy for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease.
