prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: platelet-derived growth factor receptor-ligand. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In recent years, the platelet-derived growth factor receptor-ligand (PDGFR-ligand) has emerged as a crucial player in the pathogenesis of fibrotic diseases. Activation of the PDGFR-ligand signaling axis has been linked to aberrant proliferation and migration of fibroblasts, leading to excessive deposition of extracellular matrix proteins in various tissues. Notably, dysregulated PDGFR-ligand signaling has been implicated in the progression of conditions such as idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and liver cirrhosis. Consequently, targeting this pathway has garnered significant attention as a potential therapeutic strategy for ameliorating fibrotic disorders. Further elucidation of the precise molecular mechanisms underlying PDGFR-ligand-mediated fibrosis may provide valuable insights into the development of novel pharmacological interventions for these debilitating conditions.
