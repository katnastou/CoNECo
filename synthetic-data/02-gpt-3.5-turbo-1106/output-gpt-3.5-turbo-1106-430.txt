prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: BtuCD. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The BtuCD protein complex is an essential component of the bacterial outer membrane transport system responsible for the uptake of vitamin B12 (cobalamin). Previous research has shown that this complex is integral to the survival and pathogenicity of a number of bacteria, including Escherichia coli and Salmonella enterica. Inhibition of BtuCD has been proposed as a potential strategy for limiting the growth and virulence of these pathogens. Furthermore, mutations in genes encoding the BtuCD complex have been associated with cobalamin deficiency and subsequent neurological disorders in humans. Understanding the structure and function of BtuCD is therefore of great interest for developing novel antimicrobial therapies and elucidating the role of cobalamin in human health.
