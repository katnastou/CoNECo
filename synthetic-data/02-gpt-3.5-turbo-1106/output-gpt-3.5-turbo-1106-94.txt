prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: photosystem IIs. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: Photosystem IIs (PSIIs) are integral to the process of oxygenic photosynthesis in plants, algae, and cyanobacteria. The light-harvesting complexes in thylakoid membranes absorb photons and transfer the excitation energy to the PSIIs, which then catalyze the water-splitting reaction that provides the electrons needed for the generation of reducing power. The resulting molecular oxygen is released as a byproduct, supporting aerobic life on Earth. Understanding the structural and functional characteristics of PSIIs is crucial for developing novel bioenergy and agricultural applications, as well as for elucidating the molecular basis of redox regulation and oxidative stress responses in living organisms. The complex interplay between PSIIs and other photosynthetic components underscores the importance of further investigating their role in the broader context of cellular function and environmental adaptation.
