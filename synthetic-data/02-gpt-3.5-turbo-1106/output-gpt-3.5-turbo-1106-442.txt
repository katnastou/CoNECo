prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4F. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4F (eIF4F) complex plays a crucial role in the regulation of protein synthesis in eukaryotic cells. Dysregulation of eIF4F has been implicated in various human diseases, including cancer and neurological disorders. Recent studies have reported that the small molecule inhibitor, rocaglamide, can selectively disrupt eIF4F function, leading to decreased protein synthesis and impaired cell proliferation. Furthermore, the development of rocaglamide derivatives with improved potency and selectivity holds promise for the potential treatment of eIF4F-related diseases. These findings suggest that targeting eIF4F with small molecule inhibitors may provide a valuable strategy for therapeutic intervention in diseases associated with dysregulated protein synthesis.
