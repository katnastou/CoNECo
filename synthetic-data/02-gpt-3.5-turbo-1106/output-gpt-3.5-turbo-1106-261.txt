prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: Flexilin. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The extracellular matrix (ECM) plays a critical role in the maintenance of tissue integrity and function. Flexilin, a member of the transglutaminase-dependent ECM protein family, has been implicated in the organization and stability of fibrillar structures within connective tissues. Previous studies have suggested that mutations in the flexilin gene may be associated with a variety of connective tissue disorders, including Marfan syndrome and Ehlers-Danlos syndrome. Furthermore, evidence has indicated that dysregulation of flexilin expression may contribute to the pathogenesis of fibrotic diseases such as systemic sclerosis. Understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying the function of flexilin in ECM organization and its implications for disease pathology holds promise for the development of novel therapeutic approaches targeting ECM-related disorders.
