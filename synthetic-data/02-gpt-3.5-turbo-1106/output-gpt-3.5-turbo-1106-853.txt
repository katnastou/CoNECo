prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: MAC. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The membrane attack complex (MAC) is a pivotal effector mechanism of the immune system in defending against pathogenic microorganisms and infected cells. It is composed of multiple proteins, including C5b, C6, C7, C8, and C9, which assemble on the surface of target membranes to form a transmembrane pore, resulting in cell lysis. Dysregulation of MAC activity has been implicated in a range of diseases, such as paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria and systemic lupus erythematosus. Furthermore, MAC has also been studied as a potential therapeutic target for modulating immune responses in conditions such as autoimmune diseases and microbial infections. Understanding the complex interplay of MAC in the context of host-pathogen interactions and disease pathogenesis is crucial for the development of targeted interventions and therapeutics.
