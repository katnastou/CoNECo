prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: Fc-epsilon receptor I. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we investigated the role of Fc-epsilon receptor I (FcεRI) in the pathogenesis of allergic diseases. Utilizing a murine model, we observed a robust upregulation of FcεRI expression in mast cells following exposure to allergens. Furthermore, administration of an FcεRI-blocking agent resulted in a substantial reduction in allergic inflammatory response in the experimental animals, suggesting the pivotal role of FcεRI in mediating allergic reactions. These findings shed light on the potential of targeting FcεRI as a novel therapeutic approach for managing allergic diseases, holding promise for the development of more effective treatment strategies for individuals suffering from allergic conditions.
