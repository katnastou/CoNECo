prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: IL-15-receptor. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The role of the IL-15-receptor in the pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis has been the subject of intense investigation in recent years. Studies have demonstrated that the binding of IL-15 to its receptor on the surface of immune cells leads to the activation of downstream signaling pathways, resulting in the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and the proliferation of effector T cells. Furthermore, animal models have provided evidence that targeting the IL-15-receptor can ameliorate the severity of rheumatoid arthritis, suggesting that this protein complex may be a promising therapeutic target for this debilitating autoimmune disease. Additionally, clinical trials evaluating the efficacy of IL-15-receptor inhibitors in rheumatoid arthritis patients have shown promising results, providing further support for the potential clinical utility of targeting this complex in the management of rheumatoid arthritis.
