prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: Kinetochore CCAN. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In recent years, the role of the Kinetochore CCAN in the progression of cancer has gained significant attention. The Kinetochore CCAN complex, composed of various proteins including CENP-C, CENP-T, and CENP-N, has been implicated in the regulation of chromosome segregation and proper kinetochore-microtubule attachment during cell division. Dysregulation of the Kinetochore CCAN complex has been associated with aberrant mitotic events, leading to aneuploidy and genomic instability in cancer cells. Furthermore, studies have demonstrated that targeting specific components of the Kinetochore CCAN complex, such as CENP-C, may offer a promising therapeutic strategy for cancer treatment. Understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying the function of the Kinetochore CCAN complex in cancer pathogenesis could provide novel insights for the development of targeted therapies aimed at disrupting the progression of malignancies.
