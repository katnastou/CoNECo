prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: interleukin-12. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we investigated the therapeutic potential of targeting the interleukin-12 (IL-12) pathway in the context of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). To determine the impact of IL-12 inhibition on disease progression, a murine model of colitis was utilized. Our results revealed that blocking IL-12 signaling significantly ameliorated colitis severity, as evidenced by reduced intestinal inflammation and improved overall histopathological scores. Moreover, IL-12 inhibition led to a notable decrease in pro-inflammatory cytokine production within the intestinal mucosa, suggesting a critical role for IL-12 in the pathogenesis of IBD. Therefore, targeting the IL-12 pathway may hold promise as a potential therapeutic strategy for the management of IBD.
