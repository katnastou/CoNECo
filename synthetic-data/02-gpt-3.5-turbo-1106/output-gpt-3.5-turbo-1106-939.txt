prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: NUMAC. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: Recent studies have shown that the protein complex NUMAC plays a critical role in the regulation of mitotic spindle assembly and chromosome segregation. A study conducted on a mouse model revealed that depletion of NUMAC resulted in severe spindle defects and chromosome misalignment, leading to aneuploidy. Furthermore, it was demonstrated that NUMAC interacts with proteins involved in microtubule organization and kinetochore assembly, suggesting its crucial involvement in ensuring proper mitotic progression. Additionally, dysregulation of NUMAC expression has been implicated in certain malignancies, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target for cancer treatment. These findings shed light on the fundamental role of NUMAC in maintaining genomic stability and its implications in disease pathogenesis. Further investigation into the molecular mechanisms underlying NUMAC function will provide valuable insights into its therapeutic potential in cancer and other mitotic-related disorders.
