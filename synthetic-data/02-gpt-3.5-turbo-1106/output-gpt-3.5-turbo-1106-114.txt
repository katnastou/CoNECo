prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: CDL2. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The CDL2 protein complex has been implicated in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's. Previous studies have shown that dysregulation of CDL2 can lead to abnormal aggregation of amyloid-beta and Î±-synuclein, which are hallmark features of these conditions. In addition, evidence suggests that CDL2 interacts with various cellular components involved in oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction, processes known to be associated with neurodegeneration. Targeting CDL2 as a potential therapeutic intervention has garnered significant interest, with promising results in preclinical models of neurodegenerative diseases. Further investigation into the molecular mechanisms underlying the role of CDL2 in disease pathology may provide critical insights for the development of novel treatment strategies.
