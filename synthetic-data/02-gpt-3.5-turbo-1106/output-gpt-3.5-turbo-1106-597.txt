prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: GGTase-I. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we investigated the role of the GGTase-I protein complex in the pathogenesis of lung cancer. We found that GGTase-I is crucial for the post-translational modification of small GTP-binding proteins, which are known to play a crucial role in cellular signaling pathways. Using a mouse model of lung cancer, we observed that inhibition of GGTase-I activity resulted in a significant reduction in tumor growth and metastasis. Additionally, our analysis revealed that the expression of GGTase-I was elevated in lung cancer tissues compared to healthy lung tissues. These findings suggest that targeting GGTase-I could be a promising therapeutic strategy for the treatment of lung cancer. Further investigation into the molecular mechanisms underlying the involvement of GGTase-I in lung cancer progression is warranted to develop targeted therapies for this devastating disease.
