model: gpt-3.5-turbo-1106
prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: Trf4. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: 
In this study, we investigated the role of the Trf4 protein complex in cellular regulation and disease progression. Our findings demonstrate a novel association between the Trf4 complex and the regulation of cell proliferation in breast cancer cells. Furthermore, we identified a small molecule inhibitor that effectively disrupts the interaction between Trf4 and its target in breast cancer cells, leading to a significant reduction in cell viability. These results highlight the potential therapeutic implications of targeting the Trf4 complex in breast cancer treatment. Moreover, our study sheds light on the intricate molecular mechanisms underlying cancer progression and offers a promising avenue for future research into novel therapeutic interventions.
