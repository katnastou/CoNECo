prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: IF-2B. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we investigated the role of IF-2B in the regulation of protein synthesis in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). We analyzed the expression levels of IF-2B in peripheral blood mononuclear cells from SLE patients and healthy controls, and found a significant decrease in IF-2B levels in SLE patients compared to controls. Furthermore, we observed a negative correlation between IF-2B expression levels and disease activity scores in the SLE patient cohort. Our results suggest that dysregulation of IF-2B may contribute to the aberrant protein synthesis and immune dysfunction observed in SLE, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target for managing SLE-related complications. This study provides new insights into the role of IF-2B in SLE pathogenesis and opens avenues for further research into mechanisms underlying dysregulated protein synthesis in autoimmune diseases.
