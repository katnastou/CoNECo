prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: mammalian spliceosomal complex E. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The mammalian spliceosomal complex E has been a subject of extensive investigation due to its crucial role in pre-mRNA splicing. The complex contains various non-coding RNA molecules and associated protein factors, and is directly involved in the removal of introns and the ligation of exons to generate mature mRNA transcripts. Dysregulation of the complex has been implicated in several human diseases, including spinal muscular atrophy and certain forms of cancer. Recent studies have identified small molecule inhibitors that target specific components of the complex, providing potential avenues for therapeutic intervention in diseases associated with aberrant splicing. Furthermore, the structural characterization of the mammalian spliceosomal complex E has shed light on its assembly and regulation, providing valuable insights for the development of new strategies to modulate its function for therapeutic purposes.
