prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: m(6)A writer. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The m(6)A writer is a key component of the N6-methyladenosine (m(6)A) RNA modification machinery that is responsible for installing m(6)A marks on RNA transcripts. Dysregulation of m(6)A modification has been implicated in various human diseases, including cancer, metabolic disorders, and neurological conditions. Recent studies have identified small molecule inhibitors targeting the m(6)A writer complex as potential therapeutic agents for the treatment of leukemia and solid tumors. Additionally, the m(6)A writer has been shown to play a role in the regulation of mRNA stability and translation, highlighting its importance in post-transcriptional gene expression control. Further investigation into the molecular mechanisms of the m(6)A writer complex will provide valuable insights for the development of novel therapeutic interventions for m(6)A-related diseases.
