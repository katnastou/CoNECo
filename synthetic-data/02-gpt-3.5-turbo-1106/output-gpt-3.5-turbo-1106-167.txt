prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: axonemal dynein light chain. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we investigated the role of axonemal dynein light chain in the pathogenesis of primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD), a genetic disorder characterized by impaired motile cilia function. We analyzed the expression levels of axonemal dynein light chain in nasal epithelial cells from PCD patients and control individuals, and found a significant downregulation in PCD samples. Furthermore, we observed a correlation between decreased axonemal dynein light chain expression and impaired ciliary motility in PCD patients. Our findings suggest that aberrant axonemal dynein light chain expression may contribute to the defective ciliary motility observed in PCD, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target for the management of this debilitating disorder.
