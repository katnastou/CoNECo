prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: ATAC. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The ATAC (Ada-Two-A Containing) complex plays a crucial role in chromatin accessibility and gene regulation. Recent studies have implicated the ATAC complex in the pathogenesis of several diseases, including cancer and neurological disorders. Furthermore, dysregulation of the ATAC complex has been linked to altered cellular signaling pathways and aberrant gene expression profiles. Understanding the mechanisms underlying the function of the ATAC complex may provide novel insights into disease etiology and facilitate the development of targeted therapeutic strategies. Additionally, investigation of small molecule modulators targeting the ATAC complex may offer potential avenues for drug development and precision medicine approaches. This burgeoning area of research holds promise for elucidating the pathophysiological relevance of the ATAC complex and its potential as a therapeutic target.
