prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: alpha3-beta1 integrin. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In recent years, the interaction between the alpha3-beta1 integrin protein complex and tumorigenesis has garnered significant attention in the field of cancer research. Studies have revealed a key role for alpha3-beta1 integrin in the progression of various cancer types, including breast, lung, and colon cancer. Furthermore, aberrant expression of alpha3-beta1 integrin has been implicated in promoting metastasis and invasion in these malignancies. In addition, targeting the alpha3-beta1 integrin pathway has emerged as a potential therapeutic strategy for inhibiting cancer progression and metastasis. Further elucidation of the signaling pathways associated with alpha3-beta1 integrin may offer valuable insights into developing novel targeted therapies for cancer treatment.
