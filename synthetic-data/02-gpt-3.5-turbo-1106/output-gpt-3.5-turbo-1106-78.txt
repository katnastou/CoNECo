prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: Integration host factor. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The Integration Host Factor (IHF) is a DNA-binding protein complex found in a wide range of bacterial species. Previous studies have implicated IHF in gene regulation, DNA replication, and other important cellular processes. Given its essential role in bacterial physiology, IHF has become a target of interest for the development of novel antimicrobial agents. Understanding the structural and functional properties of IHF is crucial for the design of compounds that can selectively disrupt its activities without impacting essential host functions. In this study, we investigated the interactions between IHF and small molecule inhibitors using a combination of biophysical and biochemical techniques. Our findings shed light on the potential for developing IHF-specific therapeutics for the treatment of bacterial infections.
