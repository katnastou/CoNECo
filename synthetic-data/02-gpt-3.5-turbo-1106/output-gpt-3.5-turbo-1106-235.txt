prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: CPC. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The chromosomal passenger complex (CPC) is a critical regulator of mitosis and cytokinesis in eukaryotic cells. Consisting of four key subunits, including Aurora B kinase, INCENP, Survivin, and Borealin, the CPC is involved in ensuring proper chromosome alignment, segregation, and cytokinesis. Dysregulation of CPC activity has been implicated in various human diseases, including cancer, where aberrant CPC function can lead to genomic instability and tumorigenesis. Furthermore, pharmaceutical agents targeting the CPC have shown promise as potential therapies for cancer and other proliferative disorders. Understanding the precise molecular mechanisms underlying CPC function and dysregulation will be essential for developing novel and effective treatments for diseases associated with mitotic dysfunction.
