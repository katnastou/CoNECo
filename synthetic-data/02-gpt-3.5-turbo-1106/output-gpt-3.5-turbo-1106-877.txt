prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: IgE. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The role of the IgE complex in allergic response has been a topic of extensive research, as the interaction between IgE and its high-affinity receptor, FcÎµRI, is known to play a critical role in the pathogenesis of allergic diseases such as asthma, atopic dermatitis, and allergic rhinitis. IgE-mediated activation of mast cells and basophils results in the release of inflammatory mediators, leading to the characteristic symptoms of immediate hypersensitivity reactions. In addition, levels of IgE have been found to be elevated in individuals with allergic diseases, indicating its potential as a biomarker for disease diagnosis and monitoring. Targeting the IgE complex has thus emerged as a promising approach for the development of novel therapeutic strategies to alleviate the burden of allergic diseases.
