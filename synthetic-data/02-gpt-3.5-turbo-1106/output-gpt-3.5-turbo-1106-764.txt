prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: T4SS. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The Type IV secretion system (T4SS) is a key virulence factor in several bacterial pathogens, playing a critical role in the translocation of effector proteins into host cells. Furthermore, T4SS has been implicated in the pathogenesis of numerous infectious diseases, including Helicobacter pylori-induced gastric ulcers, as well as the dissemination of antibiotic resistance determinants in various clinical settings. The complex interplay between T4SS and host immune responses underscores the significance of understanding its molecular mechanisms to develop targeted interventions for combating bacterial infections. Additionally, elucidating the structural and functional aspects of T4SS may also facilitate the identification of novel therapeutic strategies to mitigate the impact of T4SS-mediated pathogenicity.
