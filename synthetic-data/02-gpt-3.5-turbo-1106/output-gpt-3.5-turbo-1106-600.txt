prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: MetNI. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we investigate the role of the MetNI complex in the transport of sulfur-containing compounds in Escherichia coli. The MetNI complex, consisting of a membrane-associated transporter and an ATP-binding cassette protein, plays a crucial role in the uptake and delivery of methionine, an essential amino acid, to support cellular metabolism and growth. Through a series of experiments using E. coli strains with targeted mutations in the metNI genes, we demonstrate the critical involvement of the MetNI complex in the uptake of methionine and its derivatives, highlighting its significance in maintaining cellular homeostasis. Furthermore, we show that disruption of the MetNI complex leads to impaired methionine transport, which in turn affects sulfur metabolism and cellular viability. Our findings shed light on the importance of the MetNI complex in the regulation of methionine uptake and its potential implications for understanding metabolic disorders associated with sulfur metabolism dysfunction.
