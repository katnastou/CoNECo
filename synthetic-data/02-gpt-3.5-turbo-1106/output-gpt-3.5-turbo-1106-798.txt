prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: IFT complex A. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The primary cilium plays a crucial role in cellular signaling and development, and its assembly and maintenance depend on the intraflagellar transport (IFT) complex A. Many diseases, including Bardet-Biedl syndrome and Joubert syndrome, are associated with mutations in genes encoding IFT complex A subunits. Recent studies have investigated the potential of small molecules to modulate the function of IFT complex A and restore ciliary function in disease models. Understanding the intricate molecular interactions governing the assembly and function of IFT complex A is essential for developing targeted therapies for ciliopathies and other related disorders.
