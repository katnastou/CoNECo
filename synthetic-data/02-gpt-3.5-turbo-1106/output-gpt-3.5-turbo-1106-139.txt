prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: 90S preribosome. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we investigated the role of the 90S preribosome in the pathogenesis of Diamond-Blackfan anemia (DBA), a genetic disorder characterized by bone marrow failure and a predisposition to cancer. We discovered that mutations in the non-coding RNA components of the 90S preribosome result in aberrant ribosome biogenesis and impaired translation of erythroid-specific mRNAs, contributing to the erythroid lineage defects observed in DBA patients. Furthermore, we found that small molecule inhibitors targeting the 90S preribosome assembly pathway restored erythropoiesis in DBA patient-derived cells, suggesting a potential therapeutic strategy for this debilitating disease. These findings shed light on the critical role of the 90S preribosome in erythropoiesis and provide a foundation for the development of novel treatments for DBA.
