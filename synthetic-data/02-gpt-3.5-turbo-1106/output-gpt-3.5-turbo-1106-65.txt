prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: holo-[acyl-carrier-protein] synthase. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we investigated the role of the holo-[acyl-carrier-protein] synthase protein complex in the pathogenesis of bacterial infections. Our findings reveal a direct correlation between the expression levels of holo-[acyl-carrier-protein] synthase and the virulence of the pathogen. Moreover, we identified a novel small molecule inhibitor that selectively targets the activity of holo-[acyl-carrier-protein] synthase, leading to a significant reduction in bacterial growth and enhanced susceptibility to antibiotic treatment. These results provide a promising new avenue for the development of therapeutic interventions against multidrug-resistant bacterial infections. Our study highlights the potential of targeting holo-[acyl-carrier-protein] synthase as a viable strategy to combat bacterial pathogens and mitigate the spread of antibiotic resistance.
