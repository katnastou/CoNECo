prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: IML1. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we investigate the role of the IML1 protein complex in the regulation of autophagy in Arabidopsis thaliana. Through a series of experiments involving mutant and wild-type plant lines, we demonstrate that the absence of the IML1 complex leads to impaired autophagic responses under nutrient deprivation conditions. Furthermore, we show that the expression levels of certain autophagy-related genes are dependent on the presence of the IML1 complex. Our findings suggest that the IML1 complex plays a crucial role in the fine-tuning of autophagic processes in plants, indicating its potential as a target for interventions aimed at modulating autophagy in the context of plant stress responses and development.
