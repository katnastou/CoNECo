prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: ClpAP protease. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we investigated the role of the ClpAP protease complex in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases. Using a transgenic mouse model expressing mutated tau protein, we demonstrated that inhibition of ClpAP protease activity led to increased accumulation of misfolded proteins and exacerbated neurodegeneration. Furthermore, our results showed that administration of a small molecule inhibitor targeting the ClpAP protease effectively attenuated tau pathology and improved cognitive function in these mice. These findings suggest that the ClpAP protease complex represents a promising therapeutic target for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases characterized by abnormal protein aggregation, such as Alzheimer's disease and frontotemporal dementia.
