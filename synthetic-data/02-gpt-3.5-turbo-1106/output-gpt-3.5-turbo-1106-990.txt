prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: cytochrome bc(1). Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In recent years, interest in the cytochrome bc(1) protein complex has increased significantly due to its crucial role in mitochondrial electron transport and its potential as a target for antimalarial drugs. Investigation of the structural and functional properties of the cytochrome bc(1) complex has revealed new insights into its mechanism of action and its association with various diseases, including mitochondrial dysfunction-related disorders and some forms of cancer. Additionally, small molecule inhibitors targeting the cytochrome bc(1) complex have shown promise in preclinical studies as potential treatments for malaria. Further elucidation of the complex's molecular interactions and its involvement in disease pathology could pave the way for the development of novel therapeutic interventions and the expansion of our understanding of mitochondrial biology.
