prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: GDC. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The GDC protein complex has emerged as a potential target for therapeutic intervention in the context of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Recent studies have revealed the involvement of GDC in the regulation of inflammatory pathways, particularly in the context of colonic inflammation. The dysregulation of GDC activity has been implicated in the pathogenesis of IBD, with aberrant expression levels contributing to the perpetuation of inflammatory responses in the gastrointestinal tract. Furthermore, the perturbation of GDC function has been shown to exacerbate colitis in animal models, highlighting the critical role of this protein complex in the modulation of intestinal inflammation. These findings underscore the potential utility of targeting GDC as a novel strategy for the management of IBD and related gastrointestinal disorders.
