prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: surface IgD. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: Surface IgD is a critical component of the B cell receptor complex, playing a key role in the recognition and response to antigens. Research on the signaling pathways associated with surface IgD has revealed its involvement in the pathogenesis of various autoimmune diseases, including lupus and rheumatoid arthritis. An investigation into the molecular interactions between surface IgD and its ligands has provided valuable insights into the regulation of B cell activation and differentiation. Additionally, studies focusing on the modulation of surface IgD expression have shown promising implications for the development of targeted therapies for B cell-related disorders. Understanding the intricate functions of surface IgD in immune responses and autoimmune conditions is crucial for advancing the development of novel treatments and diagnostic tools.
