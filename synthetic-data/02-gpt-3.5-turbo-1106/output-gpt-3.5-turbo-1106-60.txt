prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: intracellular ferritin. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: Intracellular ferritin is a well-characterized protein complex involved in the storage of iron within cells. In this study, we investigated the role of intracellular ferritin in the context of neurodegenerative diseases, specifically Parkinson's disease. Through analysis of post-mortem brain samples from Parkinson's disease patients and healthy controls, we observed a significant dysregulation of intracellular ferritin expression in affected brain regions. Additionally, treatment with a novel small molecule inhibitor targeting intracellular ferritin led to a reduction in neuroinflammation and improved motor function in a mouse model of Parkinson's disease. These findings suggest that targeting intracellular ferritin may hold promise as a therapeutic strategy for neurodegenerative diseases characterized by iron dysregulation.
