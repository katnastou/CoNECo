prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: CoQ-synthome. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The CoQ-synthome is a critical player in the biosynthesis of coenzyme Q, a vital component of the mitochondrial respiratory chain. Emerging evidence suggests an intricate interplay between the CoQ-synthome and cellular redox homeostasis, with potential implications for metabolic disorders and aging-related pathologies. Notably, disruptions in the CoQ-synthome have been linked to mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress, and neurodegenerative diseases. Understanding the regulatory mechanisms governing the CoQ-synthome may offer novel therapeutic avenues for combating these debilitating conditions. Moreover, the identification and characterization of small molecules modulating CoQ-synthome activity hold promise for future drug development efforts aimed at restoring mitochondrial function and ameliorating coenzyme Q-related deficiencies.
