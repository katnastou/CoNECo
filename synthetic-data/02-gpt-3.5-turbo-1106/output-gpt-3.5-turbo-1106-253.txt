prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: LInker of Nucleoskeleton and Cytoskeleton. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The LInker of Nucleoskeleton and Cytoskeleton (LINC) complex plays a critical role in maintaining cellular integrity and mechanotransduction processes. Recent studies have highlighted the involvement of the LINC complex in the pathogenesis of numerous diseases, including muscular dystrophies and cardiomyopathies. The dysregulation of LINC complex function has been implicated in the progression of Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy and Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome. Furthermore, investigations into the molecular mechanisms governing LINC complex assembly and regulation have provided valuable insights into potential therapeutic targets for these debilitating conditions. The complex interplay between the LINC complex and the extracellular matrix, as well as its impact on cell signaling pathways, underscores its significance in the broader context of cellular homeostasis and disease progression. Continued research into the LINC complex promises to deliver novel therapeutic strategies for a range of debilitating disorders.
