prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: VEGF-A. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The pro-angiogenic effects of vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF-A) have been extensively studied in the context of tumor progression and neovascularization. Previous studies have demonstrated the critical role of VEGF-A in promoting the growth of blood vessels in various cancer types, leading to increased tumor vascularity and subsequently, metastasis. Furthermore, the dysregulation of VEGF-A signaling has been implicated in the pathogenesis of several retinal diseases, including diabetic retinopathy and age-related macular degeneration. Targeting the VEGF-A pathway has emerged as a promising therapeutic strategy for inhibiting excessive angiogenesis and vascular permeability in such diseases. However, the intricate interplay between VEGF-A and other pro-angiogenic factors necessitates further investigation to fully comprehend the dynamics of VEGF-A-mediated angiogenesis and to develop more effective targeted therapies.
