prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: RPA. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In recent years, increased attention has been focused on the role of the Replication Protein A (RPA) complex in the context of cancer development. The complex is known to play a critical role in DNA replication and repair processes, and dysregulation of RPA expression has been linked to the onset and progression of various malignancies, including breast and lung cancers. Furthermore, studies have shown that the interaction between RPA and certain small molecules, such as PARP inhibitors, can have implications for therapeutic approaches in cancer treatment. Understanding the intricate network of RPA-associated pathways and their impact on cancer biology may provide valuable insights for the development of targeted therapies and personalized treatment strategies for cancer patients.
