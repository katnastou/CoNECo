prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: connexon. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The connexon protein complex plays a crucial role in intercellular communication and cellular homeostasis. Recent studies have identified potential links between altered connexon structure and the pathogenesis of various neurological disorders, such as epilepsy and neurodegenerative diseases. Furthermore, the regulation of connexon expression and function has been implicated in cardiovascular diseases, including arrhythmias and ischemic cardiomyopathy. The dynamic modulation of connexon activity through chemical signaling pathways suggests its potential as a therapeutic target for addressing the underlying molecular mechanisms of these conditions. The elucidation of the molecular interactions involved in connexon function may provide valuable insights into the development of novel treatment strategies for a range of diseases with disrupted cellular communication.
