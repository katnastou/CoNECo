prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: ERN1. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The unfolded protein response (UPR) is a critical cellular process that manages endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and maintains cellular homeostasis. The ERN1 protein complex, also known as IRE1Î±, is a key player in the UPR pathway and is activated upon ER stress. Upon activation, ERN1 catalyzes the splicing of XBP1 mRNA, leading to the production of a potent transcription factor that regulates the expression of various ER chaperones and enzymes involved in protein folding. Dysregulation of ERN1 has been implicated in various diseases, including neurodegenerative disorders and metabolic diseases. Understanding the intricate regulation of the ERN1 complex and its involvement in disease pathogenesis holds promise for the development of novel therapeutic strategies targeting ER stress-related diseases.
