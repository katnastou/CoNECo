prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: CTDK. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we investigated the role of CTDK in the regulation of cell cycle progression in breast cancer cells. Through biochemical analyses, we found that CTDK is critical for the phosphorylation of key cell cycle regulators, including cyclin-dependent kinases, at specific serine and threonine residues. Furthermore, our data revealed that inhibition of CTDK activity led to a significant reduction in cell proliferation and an increase in apoptosis in breast cancer cell lines. Importantly, our findings suggest that targeting CTDK may represent a promising therapeutic strategy for the treatment of aggressive breast cancer subtypes characterized by dysregulated cell cycle control. This study sheds light on the potential of CTDK as a novel therapeutic target in breast cancer and provides a foundation for further investigation into its molecular mechanisms and clinical implications.
