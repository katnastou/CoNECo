prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: plus-end kinesin. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: Recent studies have implicated the plus-end kinesin complex in the regulation of cytoskeletal dynamics. The plus-end kinesin complex plays a crucial role in the transportation of vesicles and organelles within the cell, and its dysfunction has been associated with various neurodegenerative disorders. Additionally, aberrant activity of the plus-end kinesin complex has also been implicated in the progression of certain types of cancer. Understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying the regulation of the plus-end kinesin complex may provide valuable insights into the pathogenesis of these diseases, and could potentially lead to the development of novel therapeutic strategies targeting this complex. Further investigation into the precise role of the plus-end kinesin complex in cellular processes and disease pathogenesis is warranted to better comprehend its potential as a therapeutic target.
