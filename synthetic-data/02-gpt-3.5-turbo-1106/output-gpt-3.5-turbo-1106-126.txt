prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: RDRC. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: Due to its pivotal role in antiviral defense, the RDRC protein complex has garnered significant attention in recent research efforts. In particular, investigations into the interaction between RDRC and viral RNA have revealed promising avenues for the development of novel therapeutic strategies targeting RNA viruses. This interaction has been shown to modulate the host immune response to RNA viral infections, highlighting the potential of RDRC as a key player in the pathogenesis of diseases such as influenza, hepatitis C, and dengue fever. Furthermore, recent studies have implicated small molecule inhibitors of RDRC in the potentiation of antiviral activity, offering a promising approach for the development of future antiviral therapies. These findings underscore the significance of RDRC as a potential target for the treatment of RNA viral infections and emphasize the need for continued research into the molecular mechanisms underlying its function.
