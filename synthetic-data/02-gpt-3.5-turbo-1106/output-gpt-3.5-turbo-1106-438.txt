prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: KEOPS/EKC. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The KEOPS/EKC protein complex has emerged as a crucial regulator of cellular function, exerting its effects through interactions with various cellular processes. Research has demonstrated that the dysregulation of KEOPS/EKC is associated with several human diseases, including developmental disorders and neurological impairments. In addition to its role in human health, studies have revealed evolutionary conservation of the KEOPS/EKC complex across diverse species, highlighting its fundamental importance in cellular physiology. Furthermore, recent investigations have implicated the involvement of small molecules in modulating the activity of KEOPS/EKC, presenting opportunities for therapeutic interventions targeting this complex. These findings underscore the significance of understanding the molecular mechanisms governing the function of the KEOPS/EKC protein complex in health and disease.
