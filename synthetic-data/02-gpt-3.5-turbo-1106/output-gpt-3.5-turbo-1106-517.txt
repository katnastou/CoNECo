prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: tuberin-hamartin. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we investigated the role of the tuberin-hamartin complex in the development of neurological disorders, particularly in the context of tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC). Using a mouse model of TSC, we observed dysregulation of downstream signaling pathways associated with impaired tuberin-hamartin function. Furthermore, our findings revealed a potential link between the tuberin-hamartin complex and the pathogenesis of epilepsy, a common manifestation of TSC. Through molecular profiling of neuronal tissues, we identified specific alterations in gene expression and protein levels that are associated with the dysfunction of the tuberin-hamartin complex. These results shed light on the molecular mechanisms underlying TSC-related neurological manifestations, offering potential targets for therapeutic interventions aimed at restoring tuberin-hamartin function in affected individuals.
