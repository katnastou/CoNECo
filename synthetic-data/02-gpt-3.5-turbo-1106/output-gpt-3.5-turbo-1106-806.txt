prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: GINS. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The GINS protein complex has been the focus of numerous studies due to its critical role in DNA replication and maintenance of genomic stability. Recent research has shed light on the complex interplay between GINS and various regulatory factors within the cell cycle, elucidating its involvement in pathways associated with tumorigenesis and cancer progression. Furthermore, the dynamic interactions between GINS and its binding partners have been found to be crucial for the faithful transmission of genetic information, as disruptions in GINS function have been linked to conditions such as DNA damage, cellular senescence, and genomic instability. Understanding the molecular mechanisms governing the behavior of GINS holds promise for developing targeted therapeutic strategies for cancer and other proliferative disorders.
