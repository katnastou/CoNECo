prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: DHIC. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In recent years, the DHIC protein complex has garnered increasing attention in the field of oncology due to its potential role in cancer progression. Studies have reported elevated levels of DHIC in various malignancies, including breast cancer, colon cancer, and melanoma. Additionally, DHIC has been implicated in promoting resistance to chemotherapy and targeted therapies, posing a significant obstacle in the treatment of these aggressive cancers. Furthermore, the dysregulation of DHIC expression has been linked to poor patient outcomes, emphasizing the clinical significance of this protein complex. Given its implications in cancer biology, targeting DHIC may represent a promising therapeutic strategy for overcoming drug resistance and improving patient response to treatment. This highlights the need for further investigation into the molecular mechanisms underlying DHIC and its potential as a therapeutic target in cancer.
