prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: TRiC/CCT Chaperonin. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The TRiC/CCT chaperonin is a highly conserved, multi-subunit protein complex responsible for folding and stabilizing a wide array of client proteins critical for cellular homeostasis. Recent studies have implicated the TRiC/CCT chaperonin in the pathophysiology of various neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease. Additionally, investigations into the role of small molecule inhibitors of TRiC/CCT in cancer therapy have garnered significant interest in recent years. These advances have increased our understanding of the molecular mechanisms by which the TRiC/CCT chaperonin exerts its influence in health and disease, offering potential avenues for therapeutic intervention. Further research into the chaperone activity of TRiC/CCT and its implications in diverse disease states is warranted to fully elucidate its potential as a target for therapeutic development.
