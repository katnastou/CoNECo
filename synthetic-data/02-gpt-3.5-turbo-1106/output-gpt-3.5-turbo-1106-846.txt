prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: galectin-1. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: Galectin-1 is a well-studied protein complex that has been implicated in various biological processes. Previous research has demonstrated its role in tumor growth and metastasis, as well as in modulating immune responses in the context of cancer. Recent studies have also indicated its involvement in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease. Additionally, galectin-1 has been shown to interact with glycosylated molecules and influence cell adhesion and migration. Understanding the multifaceted roles of galectin-1 in different disease states could provide valuable insights for the development of novel therapeutic strategies targeting this protein complex.
