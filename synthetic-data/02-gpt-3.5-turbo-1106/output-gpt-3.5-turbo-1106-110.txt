prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: TriC. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: A growing body of evidence suggests that the chaperonin-containing T-complex protein-1 (TriC) plays a crucial role in maintaining proteostasis and cellular function in eukaryotic cells. Recent studies have implicated TriC in the folding and assembly of structurally and functionally diverse client proteins, with implications for the progression of various neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease. Furthermore, TriC has been identified as a potential therapeutic target for cancer treatment, due to its involvement in the folding of oncogenic proteins and the regulation of cell cycle progression. The complex interplay between TriC and its client proteins underscores the importance of understanding its molecular mechanisms and physiological implications in health and disease. Further research is warranted to elucidate the intricate functional and regulatory networks in which TriC is involved and to explore its potential as a target for therapeutic intervention.
