prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: Dissolvasome. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we investigated the role of the Dissolvasome protein complex in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis. Our results demonstrated a significant upregulation of Dissolvasome activity in atherosclerotic lesions, suggesting a potential involvement of this complex in the disease process. Furthermore, inhibition of Dissolvasome activity with a specific small molecule inhibitor led to a reduction in atherosclerotic plaque formation in a murine model. Additionally, analysis of human atherosclerotic lesions revealed a positive correlation between the expression levels of Dissolvasome components and the severity of the disease. These findings provide novel insights into the potential therapeutic targeting of the Dissolvasome complex for the treatment of atherosclerosis.
