prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: PSI associated light-harvesting complex I. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we investigated the interaction between the PSI associated light-harvesting complex I (PSI-LHCI) and the photosynthetic machinery in the model organism Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. We observed a significant increase in photochemical efficiency and improved light utilization efficiency upon the formation of the PSI-LHCI complex. Furthermore, we found that the presence of PSI-LHCI led to a reduction in the accumulation of reactive oxygen species, providing a protective effect against photodamage. Our results suggest that PSI-LHCI plays a crucial role in the regulation of photosynthetic activity and oxidative stress responses, highlighting its potential as a target for improving photosynthetic performance in response to environmental stresses.
