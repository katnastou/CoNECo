prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: RubisCO. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: RubisCO, also known as ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase, is a key enzyme involved in the Calvin cycle of photosynthesis, responsible for catalyzing the carboxylation of ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate. This enzyme is present in a wide range of organisms, including plants, algae, and cyanobacteria. The efficiency of RubisCO in fixing carbon dioxide is crucial for the growth and survival of these organisms. However, RubisCO has a relatively low catalytic activity and can also catalyze oxygenation of ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate, leading to a wasteful process known as photorespiration. Strategies aimed at improving the catalytic efficiency of RubisCO or bypassing its limitations have been a focus of research efforts in the field of plant biology and bioengineering. Understanding the structural and functional aspects of RubisCO is therefore of great importance for enhancing photosynthetic carbon fixation and ultimately addressing global food security and climate change challenges.
