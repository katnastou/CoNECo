prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: FAS. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we investigated the role of the FAS protein complex in the pathogenesis of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). We conducted a series of experiments using a mouse model of NAFLD, and observed a significant upregulation of FAS expression in the liver tissue of these mice. Furthermore, we found that inhibition of FAS activity using a small molecule inhibitor resulted in a reduction of hepatic steatosis and improved insulin sensitivity in the mice. Our findings suggest that targeting the FAS protein complex may be a promising therapeutic strategy for the treatment of NAFLD and its associated metabolic complications. These results provide valuable insights into the underlying molecular mechanisms of NAFLD and offer potential avenues for the development of novel pharmacological interventions targeting FAS.
