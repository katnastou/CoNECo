prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: 3M. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In recent years, the study of the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases has led to a focus on the molecular mechanisms underlying disease progression. One intriguing protein complex that has emerged as a potential key player in these processes is the 3M complex. Research suggests that the 3M complex may interact with various chemical entities in the central nervous system, potentially influencing the development and progression of neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease. Furthermore, investigations into the role of the 3M complex in neurodegeneration have revealed potential connections with aging-related pathways, highlighting the complex interplay between molecular entities and disease progression in the context of neurodegenerative conditions. This new avenue of research holds promise for identifying novel therapeutic targets for neurodegenerative diseases.
