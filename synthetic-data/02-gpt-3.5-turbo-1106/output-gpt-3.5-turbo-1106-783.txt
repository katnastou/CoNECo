prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: GGTaseI. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The role of the protein prenylation pathway in cancer development and progression has gained increasing attention in recent years. GGTaseI, an important enzyme in the prenylation pathway, plays a crucial role in the posttranslational modification of proteins involved in cell signaling and proliferation. Inhibition of GGTaseI has been shown to affect the cellular localization and activity of various signaling proteins, contributing to the dysregulation of critical pathways in cancer, such as the Ras signaling pathway. Consequently, targeting GGTaseI has emerged as a potential therapeutic strategy for combating oncogenesis and metastasis in multiple cancer types. Despite the promising preclinical studies, further investigations are warranted to elucidate the exact mechanisms underlying GGTaseI-mediated tumorigenesis and to evaluate the efficacy and safety of GGTaseI inhibitors in clinical settings.
