prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: Toc. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The Toc protein complex plays a crucial role in the import of nuclear-encoded proteins into chloroplasts in plants. The Toc complex is responsible for the recognition and translocation of pre-proteins across the chloroplast outer membrane. A recent study conducted in Arabidopsis thaliana has revealed the importance of the Toc complex in maintaining chloroplast function under abiotic stress conditions. The study demonstrated that the Toc complex interacts with a specific chemical signaling pathway that regulates the response to drought stress, highlighting the intricate crosstalk between cellular compartments and stress-responsive pathways. These findings provide valuable insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying chloroplast function and stress adaptation, with potential implications for the management of crop productivity under changing environmental conditions.
