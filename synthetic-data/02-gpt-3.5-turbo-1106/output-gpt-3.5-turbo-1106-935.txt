prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: RFC. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The replication factor C (RFC) complex has been implicated in various cellular processes, including DNA replication and DNA repair. Recent studies have shown that RFC plays a crucial role in maintaining genome stability and integrity by ensuring accurate copying of genetic material during cell division. Dysregulation of RFC function has been associated with a number of human diseases, including cancer and certain genetic disorders. Furthermore, the interactions between RFC and various cellular proteins and DNA structures have been investigated to elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying its activity. Understanding the role of RFC in cellular processes and disease pathogenesis may uncover potential therapeutic targets for the treatment of cancer and genetic disorders.
