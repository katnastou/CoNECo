prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: BCDX2. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we aimed to investigate the potential therapeutic role of BCDX2 in the treatment of colorectal cancer. Our findings revealed a significant downregulation of BCDX2 expression in tumor tissues compared to adjacent normal tissue samples from colorectal cancer patients. Treatment with a novel small molecule inhibitor targeting BCDX2 resulted in reduced tumor growth and increased apoptosis in colorectal cancer cell lines in vitro. Furthermore, in a murine xenograft model, administration of the BCDX2 inhibitor led to a remarkable decrease in tumor size and volume. We also observed that the BCDX2 inhibitor showed no apparent toxicity or adverse effects in normal colonic epithelial cells. These promising results suggest that BCDX2 may serve as a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of colorectal cancer. Further investigation into the underlying mechanisms of BCDX2 regulation and its interactions with other signaling pathways is warranted to fully elucidate its role in colorectal cancer progression.
