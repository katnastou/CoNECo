prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: RNA polymerase II, core. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we investigated the role of the RNA polymerase II, core protein complex in the regulation of gene expression in the context of breast cancer. Utilizing a combination of biochemical assays, cellular models, and clinical samples, we elucidated the impact of the RNA polymerase II, core complex on the transcriptional activity of key oncogenes associated with breast tumorigenesis. Our findings reveal a critical link between the activity of the RNA polymerase II, core complex and the dysregulation of gene expression in breast cancer, shedding light on potential therapeutic targets for the development of novel treatment strategies. This work provides important insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying breast cancer progression and may have implications for the development of targeted therapies aimed at modulating the activity of the RNA polymerase II, core complex to combat this devastating disease.
