prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: Imitation switch two. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we investigated the role of the Imitation Switch Two (ISW2) protein complex in the regulation of gene expression in human colorectal cancer cells. Through a series of chromatin immunoprecipitation assays, we found that ISW2 binds to the promoter regions of genes involved in cell cycle progression and DNA repair. Furthermore, knockdown of ISW2 expression resulted in dysregulation of these genes, leading to impaired cell proliferation and increased sensitivity to DNA-damaging agents. Our findings suggest that ISW2 plays a critical role in maintaining the integrity of the genome and promoting cell survival in colorectal cancer cells. This study provides new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying ISW2-mediated gene regulation and highlights its potential as a therapeutic target for colorectal cancer treatment.
