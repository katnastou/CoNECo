prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: MKS module. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The MKS module is a critical player in the pathogenesis of Meckel-Gruber syndrome, a rare ciliopathy characterized by developmental malformations affecting the central nervous system and the kidneys. This protein complex is composed of several subunits, including MKS1, MKS3, and MKS6, and is involved in the maintenance of primary cilia integrity and function. Dysfunction of the MKS module has been implicated in the dysregulation of key signaling pathways, such as the Wnt and Hedgehog pathways, leading to aberrant cell proliferation and differentiation during embryonic development. Further understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying the MKS module's role in ciliogenesis and its contribution to disease pathogenesis may provide valuable insights into potential therapeutic interventions for Meckel-Gruber syndrome and other related ciliopathies.
