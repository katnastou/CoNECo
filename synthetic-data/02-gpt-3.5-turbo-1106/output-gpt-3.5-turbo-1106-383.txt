prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: Hydrogenase 4. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: Aerobic hydrogen oxidation is a crucial process in the energy metabolism of certain microorganisms, and it relies on the activity of key enzymes such as the Hydrogenase 4 protein complex. Despite its significance, the exact mechanisms by which Hydrogenase 4 functions in the oxidation of hydrogen remain poorly understood. In this study, we investigated the role of Hydrogenase 4 in the hydrogen oxidation pathway in Escherichia coli. Our findings reveal potential interactions between Hydrogenase 4 and other respiratory enzymes, shedding light on its regulatory role in this process. This investigation expands our understanding of the molecular pathways involved in hydrogen oxidation and provides insight into potential targets for the development of novel treatments for hydrogen metabolism-related disorders.
