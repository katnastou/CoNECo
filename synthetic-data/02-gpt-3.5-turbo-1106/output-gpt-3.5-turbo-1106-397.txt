prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: ssuABC. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The ssuABC protein complex has been implicated in the regulation of bacterial sulfur metabolism. Previous studies have suggested that this complex plays a vital role in the assimilation of inorganic sulfate and other sulfur sources in various bacterial species. Furthermore, ssuABC has been linked to the pathogenesis of certain bacterial infections, such as urinary tract infections and dermatological conditions. The precise mechanism of action and the potential therapeutic targets associated with ssuABC in the context of these infectious diseases warrant further investigation. Understanding the interplay between ssuABC and bacterial pathogenicity could provide valuable insights into the development of novel treatment strategies against these infections.
