prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: ABAT. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In recent years, the ABAT protein complex has garnered increasing attention within the field of neurobiology due to its implications in various neurological disorders. ABAT, known for its role in catalyzing the conversion of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) to succinic semialdehyde, has been implicated in epileptic encephalopathy, autism spectrum disorders, and schizophrenia. Dysregulation of ABAT has been observed in animal models and clinical studies, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target for these complex and challenging conditions. Furthermore, recent studies have revealed the influence of genetic polymorphisms in ABAT on individual responses to antiepileptic drugs, shedding light on the potential for personalized medicine in the treatment of neurological disorders. As research in this area continues to advance, a deeper understanding of the ABAT protein complex promises to offer valuable insights for the development of novel therapeutic strategies targeting GABAergic dysregulation in neurological diseases.
