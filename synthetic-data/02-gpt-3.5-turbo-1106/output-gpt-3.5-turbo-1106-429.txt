prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: xylanosome. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: Our study investigated the role of the xylanosome complex in the breakdown of hemicellulose in the digestive system of ruminant animals. By using mass spectrometry and enzymatic assays, we characterized the protein constituents of the xylanosome and elucidated its enzymatic activity in xylan degradation. We also examined the effects of dietary xylan on the composition of the gut microbiota and the host's metabolic profile. Our findings suggest that the xylanosome complex plays a crucial role in the efficient utilization of xylan by ruminants, providing insights into the mechanisms underlying their unique capacity to metabolize complex plant polysaccharides. Understanding the interactions between the xylanosome complex and the gut microbiota may have implications for improving the efficiency of feed utilization and animal health in agricultural settings.
