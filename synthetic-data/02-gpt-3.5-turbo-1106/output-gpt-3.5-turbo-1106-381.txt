prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: VLA-5. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we investigated the role of the VLA-5 protein complex in the progression of rheumatoid arthritis in a murine model. Previous research has suggested that VLA-5 is involved in mediating leukocyte adhesion to the vascular endothelium, and its dysregulation has been linked to autoimmune and inflammatory conditions. Using a combination of small-molecule inhibitors and genetic knockout models, we demonstrated that blockade of VLA-5 attenuated joint inflammation and bone erosion in arthritic mice. Furthermore, our findings suggest that VLA-5 may serve as a potential therapeutic target for halting the progression of rheumatoid arthritis and reducing joint damage. These results provide valuable insights into the pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis and highlight the potential of targeting VLA-5 in the development of novel treatments for this debilitating disease.
