prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: T lymphocyte receptors. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The T lymphocyte receptors play a critical role in the adaptive immune response, recognizing and binding to antigens presented by major histocompatibility complex molecules on the surface of antigen-presenting cells. The interaction between T lymphocyte receptors and their cognate antigens initiates a signaling cascade, leading to T cell activation, proliferation, and differentiation into effector or memory T cells. Dysregulation of T lymphocyte receptors has been implicated in various autoimmune diseases, including rheumatoid arthritis and multiple sclerosis. Furthermore, T lymphocyte receptor-based immunotherapies have shown promising results in the treatment of certain cancers, harnessing the specificity and potency of these receptors to target tumor cells. Understanding the mechanisms underlying T lymphocyte receptor function and signaling pathways may provide insights for the development of novel therapeutic strategies for immune-related disorders and malignancies.
