prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: HEX A. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The HEX A protein complex has been the subject of extensive research due to its crucial role in the pathogenesis of Tay-Sachs disease, a devastating inherited neurodegenerative disorder. Previous studies have demonstrated that the absence or dysfunction of HEX A results in the accumulation of GM2 gangliosides in neuronal cells, leading to progressive neurological deterioration and ultimately, premature death in affected individuals. Given the severity of Tay-Sachs disease, there is a critical need to further elucidate the biochemical pathways and regulatory mechanisms governing HEX A activity. Recent investigations have suggested potential modulators of HEX A function, such as small molecule inhibitors and gene therapy approaches, offering promising avenues for the development of targeted therapeutic interventions for this debilitating disorder. Understanding the molecular intricacies of HEX A and its associated pathways may provide valuable insights into the development of novel treatment strategies for Tay-Sachs disease, ultimately improving the prognosis and quality of life for affected individuals.
