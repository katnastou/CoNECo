prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: CUE1-UBC7 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (E2). Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The CUE1-UBC7 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (E2) is a pivotal component in the ubiquitin-proteasome system, responsible for targeted protein degradation. Dysregulation of the ubiquitin-proteasome system has been implicated in the pathogenesis of various human diseases, including cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, and inflammatory conditions. Recent studies have highlighted the potential therapeutic significance of targeting the CUE1-UBC7 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (E2) in cancer therapy, particularly in enhancing the degradation of oncoproteins that drive tumorigenesis. Furthermore, the identification of small molecules that modulate the activity of CUE1-UBC7 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (E2) offers promising avenues for drug development and personalized medicine approaches. Further research is warranted to fully elucidate the molecular mechanisms and signaling pathways involving this crucial ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme complex.
