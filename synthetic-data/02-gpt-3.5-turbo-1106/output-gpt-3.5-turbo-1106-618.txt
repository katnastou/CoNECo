prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: PP2A. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we investigated the role of the protein complex PP2A in the pathogenesis of liver cirrhosis. Liver cirrhosis is a chronic liver disease characterized by fibrosis and impaired liver function. Using a mouse model of liver cirrhosis induced by carbon tetrachloride (CCl4) exposure, we observed a significant upregulation of PP2A expression in the liver tissue. Furthermore, treatment with a specific inhibitor of PP2A resulted in attenuation of liver fibrosis and improvement of liver function, as evidenced by reduced levels of serum liver enzymes and amelioration of hepatic architecture. These findings suggest that PP2A may be a potential therapeutic target for the management of liver cirrhosis, highlighting the importance of further investigating the molecular mechanisms underlying the involvement of PP2A in liver disease progression.
