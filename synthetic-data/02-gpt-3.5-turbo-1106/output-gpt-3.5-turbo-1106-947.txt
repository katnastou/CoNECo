prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: FcgRI. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we investigated the role of the FcgRI protein complex in the pathophysiology of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Using a murine model of SLE, we found that FcgRI expression was significantly upregulated in the kidneys of diseased animals compared to healthy controls. Furthermore, treatment with a small molecule inhibitor targeting FcgRI led to a reduction in renal inflammation and proteinuria in SLE mice. Our findings suggest that targeting FcgRI may hold promise as a therapeutic strategy for attenuating renal manifestations of SLE. Further studies are warranted to elucidate the precise mechanisms by which FcgRI contributes to SLE pathogenesis and to assess the translational potential of FcgRI inhibitors in human SLE patients.
