prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: elongator holoenzyme. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The elongator holoenzyme is a conserved protein complex that plays a critical role in various cellular processes, including transcription and tRNA modification. Recent studies have implicated the elongator holoenzyme in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative disorders, such as Alzheimer's disease and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Interestingly, the inhibition of the elongator holoenzyme has been shown to disrupt the proper functioning of the nervous system in animal models, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target for these debilitating conditions. Furthermore, the elongator holoenzyme has been found to interact with specific chemical compounds, impacting its enzymatic activity and cellular function, thereby offering potential avenues for drug development. This research sheds light on the multifaceted involvement of the elongator holoenzyme in health and disease, warranting further investigation into its molecular mechanisms and therapeutic potential.
