prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: SufBCD. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The SufBCD protein complex has been implicated in the regulation of iron-sulfur cluster biogenesis in various organisms, including bacteria and archaea. This complex plays a critical role in the assembly and transfer of iron-sulfur clusters, which are essential cofactors for a wide range of proteins involved in various cellular processes. Dysregulation of SufBCD activity has been linked to defects in iron homeostasis and increased susceptibility to oxidative stress. The complex is also involved in the response to iron depletion and has been identified as a potential target for developing novel therapeutic strategies to combat iron-related disorders such as anemia and iron overload diseases. Further investigation into the function and regulation of the SufBCD complex is essential for understanding its potential role in human health and disease.
