prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: U12-type prespliceosome. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The U12-type prespliceosome is a crucial molecular complex involved in the splicing of pre-mRNA transcripts. Recent studies have highlighted the interactions between the U12-type prespliceosome and various RNA-binding proteins, such as hnRNPs and snRNPs, indicating its role in regulating alternative splicing events. Additionally, the U12-type prespliceosome has been implicated in the modulation of gene expression in several diseases, including spinal muscular atrophy and hereditary spastic paraplegia. Furthermore, the interplay between the U12-type prespliceosome and small molecule inhibitors, such as splicing modulators, represents a potential avenue for therapeutic interventions in diseases associated with aberrant splicing patterns. Further investigation into the regulatory mechanisms and functional implications of the U12-type prespliceosome is warranted to gain insights into its role in human health and disease.
