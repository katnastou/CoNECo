prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: 20S proteasome. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The 20S proteasome is a critical component of the ubiquitin-proteasome system, which is responsible for the targeted degradation of intracellular proteins. This highly conserved protein complex plays a crucial role in maintaining cellular homeostasis by selectively degrading misfolded, damaged, or obsolete proteins. Dysregulation of the 20S proteasome has been implicated in various human diseases, including cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, and inflammatory conditions. The complex consists of multiple subunits, forming a cylindrical structure with catalytic sites located inside its central chamber. Understanding the regulation and function of the 20S proteasome has significant implications for the development of novel therapeutic strategies targeting protein turnover and cellular quality control.
