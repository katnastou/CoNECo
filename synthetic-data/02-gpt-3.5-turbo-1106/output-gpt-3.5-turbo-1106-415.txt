prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: nikABCDE. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The nikABCDE protein complex has garnered significant attention due to its crucial role in the regulation of bacterial survival and virulence. Recent studies have focused on elucidating the intricate interactions between nikABCDE and various signaling pathways that influence pathogen-host interactions. Additionally, investigations into the potential development of small molecule inhibitors targeting nikABCDE have emerged as a promising avenue for combating antibiotic-resistant bacterial strains. The interplay between nikABCDE and key cellular processes, such as biofilm formation and cytokine production, has provided valuable insights into the pathophysiology of infectious diseases caused by bacterial pathogens. These findings underscore the potential of targeting nikABCDE as a novel therapeutic strategy in the ongoing battle against microbial infections.
