prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: nucleotide-excision repair factor 4. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we investigated the role of nucleotide-excision repair factor 4 (NERF4) in the cellular response to UV-induced DNA damage. Using a combination of chemical inhibitors and RNA interference, we demonstrated that NERF4 is essential for the proper initiation and progression of nucleotide excision repair. Additionally, we found that cells deficient in NERF4 displayed an increased vulnerability to UV radiation, resulting in elevated levels of DNA damage and mutation accumulation. Our findings suggest that targeting NERF4 may provide a potential therapeutic avenue for the treatment of UV-induced DNA damage-related diseases, such as skin cancer.
