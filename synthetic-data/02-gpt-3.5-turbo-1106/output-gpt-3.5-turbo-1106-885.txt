prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: mitochondrial editosome. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The mitochondrial editosome is a key player in the RNA editing process within the mitochondria, responsible for ensuring proper post-transcriptional modification of mitochondrial RNA. Dysregulation of the mitochondrial editosome has been associated with various mitochondrial diseases, such as Leber's hereditary optic neuropathy and mitochondrial encephalomyopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episodes syndrome. The complex interplay between the mitochondrial editosome and its interacting partners, including RNA substrates and accessory proteins, highlights the intricate regulatory mechanisms governing mitochondrial RNA processing and the implications for mitochondrial function and cellular homeostasis. Understanding the molecular pathways involved in the function of the mitochondrial editosome will shed light on potential therapeutic targets for mitochondrial disorders and pave the way for the development of novel treatment strategies.
