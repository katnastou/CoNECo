prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: TRAPP. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In recent years, the TRAPP protein complex has garnered considerable attention in the field of cell biology. Studies have revealed its crucial role in intracellular vesicle trafficking and membrane dynamics. The TRAPP complex has been implicated in various cellular processes, including protein transport from the endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi apparatus. Dysregulation of TRAPP has been associated with developmental disorders and neurodegenerative diseases, highlighting its significance in human health. Furthermore, investigations into the molecular mechanisms governing the assembly and function of the TRAPP complex have provided valuable insights into the fundamental processes underlying cellular homeostasis. The continued exploration of TRAPP and its interactions with other cellular components holds promise for the development of novel therapeutic interventions targeting diseases rooted in disturbed vesicular transport pathways.
