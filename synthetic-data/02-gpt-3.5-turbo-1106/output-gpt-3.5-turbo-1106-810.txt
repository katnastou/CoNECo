prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: BBSomes. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we aimed to investigate the functional role of BBSomes in the pathogenesis of obesity-related metabolic disorders. We utilized a murine model of diet-induced obesity and examined the impact of genetic ablation of BBSomes on metabolic homeostasis. Our results revealed that loss of BBSomes led to exacerbated adiposity, impaired glucose tolerance, and dyslipidemia in the context of high-fat diet feeding. Furthermore, we observed alterations in the expression levels of key metabolic regulators, including PPARÎ³, adiponectin, and leptin, in the absence of BBSomes. These findings suggest a critical involvement of BBSomes in the regulation of adipose tissue function and systemic energy metabolism. Understanding the mechanistic underpinnings of BBSomes in metabolic homeostasis may offer insights into potential therapeutic strategies for obesity-related complications.
