prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: Galactitol-specific enzyme II. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we aimed to investigate the role of the Galactitol-specific enzyme II complex in the pathogenesis of diabetic retinopathy. We employed a murine model of diabetes to elucidate the relationship between the activity of this enzyme complex and the progression of retinal damage. Our findings revealed a significant upregulation of Galactitol-specific enzyme II in diabetic mice compared to non-diabetic controls. Furthermore, we observed a positive correlation between the enzymatic activity of Galactitol-specific enzyme II and the severity of retinal microvascular abnormalities. These results suggest that targeting the Galactitol-specific enzyme II complex may hold promise as a novel therapeutic approach for mitigating diabetic retinopathy.
