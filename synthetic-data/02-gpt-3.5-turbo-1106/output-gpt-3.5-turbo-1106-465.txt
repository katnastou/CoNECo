prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: SSU processome. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The SSU processome is a multiprotein complex essential for the assembly and maturation of the small ribosomal subunit in eukaryotic cells. This highly conserved complex orchestrates the cleavage, folding, and modification of the pre-ribosomal RNA (pre-rRNA) to facilitate the generation of functional ribosomes. Dysregulation or dysfunction of the SSU processome has been associated with various human diseases, including ribosomopathies and cancer. Recent studies have unveiled the role of specific chemical inhibitors in modulating the activity of the SSU processome, presenting a potential avenue for therapeutic intervention in diseases linked to ribosome biogenesis. Further investigations into the molecular mechanisms underlying the function of the SSU processome hold great promise for advancing our understanding of ribosomal biogenesis and its relevance to human health.
