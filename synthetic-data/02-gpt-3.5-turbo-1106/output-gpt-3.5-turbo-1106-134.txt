prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: laminin-421. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The extracellular matrix (ECM) protein laminin-421 has been implicated in various physiological and pathological processes. Studies have highlighted its involvement in cell migration, tissue development, and disease progression. Laminin-421 has been shown to interact with integrins, contributing to cell adhesion and signaling cascades. Dysregulation of laminin-421 expression or function has been associated with several human diseases, including kidney disorders and muscular dystrophy. Moreover, the role of laminin-421 in the pathogenesis of cancer has sparked interest in exploring its potential as a therapeutic target. Understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying the functions of laminin-421 may offer insights into the development of novel therapeutic interventions for a range of diseases.
