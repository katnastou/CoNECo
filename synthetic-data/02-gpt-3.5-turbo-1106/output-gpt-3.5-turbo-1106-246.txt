prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: FtsBL. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we investigated the role of the FtsBL protein complex in the regulation of cell division in Escherichia coli. Our results demonstrate that FtsBL plays a crucial role in coordinating the assembly and function of the divisome during cytokinesis. We also observed that the absence of FtsBL leads to aberrant cell division and the formation of filamentous cells. Furthermore, our findings indicate that FtsBL interacts with key regulatory proteins such as FtsZ and MinC, underscoring its importance in the precise spatial and temporal control of cell division. Our study sheds light on the intricate mechanisms underlying bacterial cell division and presents FtsBL as a potential target for the development of novel antimicrobial agents aimed at disrupting cytokinesis in pathogenic E. coli strains.
