prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: RQC. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: Recent studies have identified a critical role for the Ribosome-Associated Quality Control (RQC) complex in the degradation of aberrant translation products. The RQC complex has been found to interact with nascent polypeptides stalled on ribosomes, particularly in response to defects in translation termination or mRNA quality. Through a series of coordinated steps, including ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation, the RQC complex acts to safeguard cellular proteostasis by preventing the accumulation of potentially toxic protein aggregates. Dysregulation of RQC function has been implicated in various neurodegenerative diseases, highlighting its significance in maintaining cellular health. Understanding the molecular mechanisms governing RQC activity may provide valuable insights for therapeutic interventions targeting protein quality control pathways.
