prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: PKS. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The role of the PKS protein complex in the pathogenesis of melanoma has been of great interest in recent years. Studies have demonstrated that the dysregulation of PKS activity is associated with an increased risk of metastasis and poor patient outcomes. In addition, the expression of PKS has been found to be elevated in melanoma cells compared to normal melanocytes. Recent research has also uncovered a potential link between PKS and the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway, suggesting that targeting PKS may provide a novel therapeutic approach for the treatment of melanoma. Further investigation into the function and regulation of PKS in melanoma is warranted to better understand its potential as a therapeutic target for this aggressive form of skin cancer.
