prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: matrilin-3. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we explored the role of the protein complex matrilin-3 in the pathogenesis of osteoarthritis. Utilizing animal models and human tissue samples, we observed a significant upregulation of matrilin-3 expression in cartilage affected by osteoarthritis compared to healthy controls. Furthermore, our findings suggest a potential association between increased levels of matrilin-3 and the progression of cartilage degradation. Our results also show a correlation between matrilin-3 expression and the severity of osteoarthritic changes in the joint tissues. This research sheds light on the involvement of matrilin-3 in the molecular mechanisms underlying osteoarthritis and highlights its potential as a target for future therapeutic interventions aimed at mitigating cartilage degeneration in this debilitating joint disease.
