prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: cardiac PLB. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we investigated the role of the cardiac PLB protein complex in the pathogenesis of dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM). We utilized a murine model of DCM and examined the expression and activity of cardiac PLB in diseased hearts. Our results revealed a significant downregulation of cardiac PLB expression and impaired phosphorylation in DCM hearts compared to healthy controls. Additionally, we observed a correlation between reduced cardiac PLB levels and the development of cardiac dysfunction in DCM mice. Furthermore, our findings suggest that dysregulation of cardiac PLB may contribute to the progression of DCM by disrupting calcium homeostasis and contractile function. These results highlight the potential therapeutic relevance of targeting cardiac PLB in the treatment of DCM.
