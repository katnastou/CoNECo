prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: Hyd-3. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we investigated the role of Hyd-3 in the progression of Parkinson's disease. Our results revealed a significant upregulation of Hyd-3 in the substantia nigra of Parkinson's disease patients compared to healthy controls. Furthermore, we observed a positive correlation between the expression levels of Hyd-3 and the severity of motor symptoms in these patients. To elucidate the molecular mechanism underlying this association, we performed in vitro experiments using a dopaminergic cell model and found that exposure to rotenone, a known environmental toxin associated with Parkinson's disease, led to a dose-dependent increase in Hyd-3 expression. These findings suggest that Hyd-3 may play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease, potentially serving as a novel therapeutic target for intervention.
