prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: NADH-Q6 oxidoreductase. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, the role of the NADH-Q6 oxidoreductase complex in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease was investigated. Using an animal model of the disease, the levels of the NADH-Q6 oxidoreductase complex in the substantia nigra were found to be significantly reduced compared to control animals. Moreover, the activity of the complex was found to be negatively correlated with disease progression, suggesting a potential link between the dysfunction of the NADH-Q6 oxidoreductase complex and the pathophysiology of Parkinson's disease. These findings highlight the importance of further exploring the role of the NADH-Q6 oxidoreductase complex in neurodegenerative diseases and may provide new insights into the development of targeted therapeutic interventions.
