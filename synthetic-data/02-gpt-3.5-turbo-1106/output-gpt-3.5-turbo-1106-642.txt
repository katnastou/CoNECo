prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: Colicin I receptor. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: Recent studies have shed light on the role of the Colicin I receptor in bacterial immunity. The Colicin I receptor is a key protein complex responsible for conferring resistance to colicin-producing bacteria, including Escherichia coli. Colicin-producing bacteria release colicins, bacteriocins that target and kill related bacterial strains. Upon binding of colicins to the Colicin I receptor, cellular entry is facilitated, leading to cytotoxic effects, which can ultimately lead to self-destruction of the invading bacterium. Understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying Colicin I receptor function is crucial for developing novel antimicrobial strategies targeting selective bacterial pathogens, thereby offering potential therapeutic interventions for infectious diseases.
