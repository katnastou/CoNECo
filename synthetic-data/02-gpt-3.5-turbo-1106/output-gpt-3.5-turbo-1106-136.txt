prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: collagen type IV trimer. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: This study aimed to investigate the potential role of the collagen type IV trimer in the pathogenesis of diabetic nephropathy. Patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and known diabetic nephropathy were included, and renal biopsies were obtained to assess the distribution and expression levels of the collagen type IV trimer within the glomerular basement membrane. In addition, serum levels of advanced glycation end products were measured and correlated with the presence of the collagen type IV trimer. Our findings suggest a potential association between increased expression of the collagen type IV trimer and advanced glycation end product accumulation in patients with diabetic nephropathy, providing further insight into the pathophysiology of this complex disease. Further investigation into the molecular mechanisms underlying this association is warranted to develop targeted therapeutic strategies for diabetic nephropathy.
