prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: R2TP. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The R2TP protein complex has been implicated in various cellular processes, including the regulation of telomerase activity and the assembly of large protein complexes. Recent studies have highlighted the role of the R2TP complex in cancer development, with dysregulation of its function linked to the progression of several malignancies. Furthermore, the interaction between the R2TP complex and HSP90 has been shown to be critical for the maintenance of protein homeostasis, particularly in the context of proteotoxic stress. Additionally, small molecule inhibitors targeting the R2TP complex have emerged as promising candidates for cancer therapy, with potential applications in the treatment of a wide range of malignancies. Overall, these findings underscore the significance of the R2TP complex in cellular physiology and disease pathogenesis, rendering it a promising target for therapeutic interventions.
