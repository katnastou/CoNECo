prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: Brahma-associated factor. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The activity of the Brahma-associated factor (BAF) protein complex has been found to play a critical role in the regulation of cellular processes, particularly in relation to cancer. Previous studies have demonstrated the involvement of BAF in chromatin remodeling and transcriptional regulation, implicating its potential significance in tumorigenesis. Moreover, the dysregulation of BAF has been associated with various malignancies, including breast cancer and prostate cancer. With an increasing understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying cancer development, targeting BAF presents a promising avenue for therapeutic intervention. Thus, further investigation into the functional relevance of BAF in cancer progression may yield valuable insights for the development of novel anti-cancer strategies.
