prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: STR. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The STR protein complex has been shown to play a critical role in maintaining cellular homeostasis and response to oxidative stress. Studies have indicated that the dysregulation of STR activity is associated with an increased susceptibility to neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's. Furthermore, the expression levels of STR have been found to correlate with the progression of certain cancers, including breast and lung cancer. Interestingly, recent investigations have revealed a potential link between STR and the regulation of metabolic pathways involved in energy metabolism. These findings highlight the multifaceted roles of the STR protein complex in various biological processes and underscore its potential as a therapeutic target for a wide range of human disorders.
