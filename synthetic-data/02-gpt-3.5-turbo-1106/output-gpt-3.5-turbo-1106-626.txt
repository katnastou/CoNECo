prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: surface IgA1. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we investigated the role of the surface IgA1 protein complex in the pathogenesis of IgA nephropathy, a common form of glomerulonephritis. Our findings revealed a significant association between the level of surface IgA1 and the severity of kidney injury in a cohort of patients with IgA nephropathy. Furthermore, we observed a correlation between the presence of aberrant glycosylation patterns in surface IgA1 and the progression of renal dysfunction. Our results suggest that the surface IgA1 protein complex may serve as a potential biomarker for monitoring disease activity and could represent a novel therapeutic target for the management of IgA nephropathy. These findings provide important insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis of this complex renal disease and highlight the potential clinical significance of targeting surface IgA1 in therapeutic interventions.
