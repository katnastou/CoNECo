prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: ExoVII. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we investigate the role of the ExoVII protein complex in the pathogenesis of colorectal cancer. Previous research has implicated the involvement of ExoVII in DNA repair mechanisms, and its potential impact on cancer development is of great interest. Utilizing a murine model of colorectal cancer, we observed a significant dysregulation of ExoVII expression in tumor tissues compared to healthy control tissues. Furthermore, our analysis revealed an upregulation of several microRNAs known to target the ExoVII complex in the tumor microenvironment. This evidence suggests a potential link between ExoVII dysregulation and colorectal cancer progression. Our findings shed light on the potential role of ExoVII in cancer development and provide avenues for further investigation into its therapeutic targeting in colorectal cancer.
