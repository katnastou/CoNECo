prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: NF-kappaBs. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: NF-kappaBs, a crucial transcription factor complex involved in the regulation of inflammatory responses, has been extensively studied in the context of various chronic diseases, including cancer and autoimmune disorders. The activation of NF-kappaBs is controlled by a range of stimuli, such as cytokines, pathogens, and cellular stress. Dysregulation of NF-kappaBs has been implicated in the pathogenesis of several diseases, including rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease, and atherosclerosis. Notably, the interplay between NF-kappaBs and various cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor alpha and interleukin-1, underlies the complex mechanisms driving chronic inflammation. Furthermore, the intricate crosstalk between NF-kappaBs and other signaling pathways, such as the PI3K/Akt pathway, underscores the multifaceted roles of NF-kappaBs in cellular homeostasis and disease pathophysiology. Understanding the precise molecular mechanisms underlying NF-kappaBs activation and regulation holds promise for the development of targeted therapeutic interventions for a broad spectrum of inflammatory and immune-mediated disorders.
