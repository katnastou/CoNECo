prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: PGGT. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we investigated the role of the prenyl protein transferase PGGT in the progression of colorectal cancer. We found that elevated PGGT expression levels were positively correlated with tumor size and lymph node metastasis in a cohort of colorectal cancer patients. In addition, in vitro experiments demonstrated that inhibition of PGGT activity resulted in decreased proliferation and increased apoptosis in colorectal cancer cell lines. Furthermore, analysis of patient tissue samples revealed strong PGGT expression in tumor tissues compared to adjacent normal tissues. Overall, our findings suggest that PGGT may serve as a potential therapeutic target in the treatment of colorectal cancer.
