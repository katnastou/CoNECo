prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: RITS. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The RNA-induced transcriptional silencing (RITS) complex is a key player in the epigenetic regulation of gene expression and maintenance of genome stability. The RITS complex is formed by the association of Argonaute and chromatin-modifying proteins, and it plays a critical role in the establishment and maintenance of heterochromatin. Studies have shown that the dysregulation of RITS complex function is associated with various human diseases, including cancer and neurodegenerative disorders. Understanding the molecular mechanisms governing the assembly and activity of the RITS complex may provide valuable insights into the development of novel therapeutic strategies for diseases with aberrant gene silencing patterns.
