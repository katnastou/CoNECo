prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: SAE. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The SUMO activating enzyme (SAE) protein complex plays a critical role in post-translational modification processes. Recent studies have shown that dysregulation of SAE activity is associated with various human diseases, including cancer and neurodegenerative disorders. In a study conducted on a murine model of Parkinson's disease, disruption of SAE function led to aberrant protein sumoylation patterns, exacerbating the pathological phenotypes. Furthermore, SAE has been implicated in the regulation of inflammatory responses, with potential implications for autoimmune diseases and chronic inflammatory conditions. Given its broad impact on cellular processes, targeting SAE may hold promise for the development of novel therapeutic interventions for diverse human diseases. Further elucidating the precise mechanisms underlying SAE function and dysregulation will be critical for harnessing its therapeutic potential.
