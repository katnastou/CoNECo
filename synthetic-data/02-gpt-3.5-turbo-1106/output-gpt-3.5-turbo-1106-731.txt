prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: rixosome. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we aimed to investigate the role of the rixosome protein complex in the pathogenesis of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Our results demonstrate a significant upregulation of rixosome expression in leukemic cells compared to healthy control samples. Furthermore, our functional assays revealed that inhibition of rixosome activity led to a decrease in leukemic cell proliferation and an increase in apoptosis, suggesting a critical role for rixosome in the survival and growth of ALL cells. Importantly, we also identified a specific small molecule inhibitor that effectively targets the rixosome complex, providing a potential therapeutic strategy for the treatment of ALL. This study sheds light on the significance of rixosome in leukemia and underscores its potential as a novel therapeutic target for this devastating disease.
