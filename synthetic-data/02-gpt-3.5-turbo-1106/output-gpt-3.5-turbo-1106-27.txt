prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: nucleotide-excision repair factor 1. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: Nucleotide-excision repair factor 1 (NERF1) is a critical player in the DNA repair process, contributing to genome stability and the prevention of mutations. Dysfunction of NERF1 has been associated with a variety of diseases, including xeroderma pigmentosum, characterized by extreme photosensitivity and a heightened susceptibility to skin cancer. Recent studies have demonstrated the importance of NERF1 in the repair of DNA damage induced by environmental mutagens, such as UV radiation and certain chemical agents. Further research into the regulation and function of NERF1 will shed light on its potential as a therapeutic target for the treatment of DNA repair-deficient diseases.
