prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: type III PKS. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: Type III PKS (polyketide synthase) is a crucial enzyme complex involved in the biosynthesis of a wide variety of natural products, including antibiotics and antitumor agents. The Type III PKS catalyzes the iterative decarboxylative condensation of malonyl-CoA units to produce polyketides, which serve as important chemical intermediates in various biological processes. Several studies have demonstrated the significance of Type III PKS in the production of polyketides with diverse bioactivities. For example, the biosynthetic pathways of several clinically relevant natural products, such as erythromycin and tetracycline, heavily rely on the enzymatic activity of the Type III PKS complex. Insights into the regulation and functionality of Type III PKS have significant implications for the discovery and development of novel therapeutics targeting various infectious diseases and cancer. Therefore, further investigation into the molecular mechanisms underlying the biosynthesis of polyketides by Type III PKS will aid in the design and optimization of potential pharmaceutical agents.
