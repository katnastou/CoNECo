prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: SufBCDs. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we investigated the role of the SufBCDs protein complex in the pathogenesis of iron-sulfur cluster biogenesis disorders. Using a murine model, we observed a significant downregulation of SufBCDs expression in tissues affected by the disease, suggesting a potential link between the malfunction of this complex and the development of iron-sulfur cluster deficiency-related phenotypes. Through a combination of chemical compounds targeting the iron-sulfur cluster biogenesis pathway and genetic manipulation of SufBCDs expression, we identified a potential therapeutic strategy to ameliorate the symptoms associated with these disorders. Our findings shed light on the molecular mechanisms underlying iron-sulfur cluster deficiency and provide new insights into the potential therapeutic interventions for these debilitating diseases.
