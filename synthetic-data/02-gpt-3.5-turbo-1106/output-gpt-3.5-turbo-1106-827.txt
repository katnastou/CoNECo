prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: ribonuclease H2. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we investigated the role of ribonuclease H2 in the pathogenesis of Aicardi-Goutières syndrome, a rare autoimmune disease characterized by neurological and cutaneous manifestations. Using a knockout mouse model lacking the ribonuclease H2 complex, we observed a significant increase in the levels of cytoplasmic nucleic acid accumulation and activation of innate immune pathways. Furthermore, treatment with a small molecule inhibitor of ribonuclease H2 resulted in exacerbation of disease phenotypes, supporting the critical role of this protein complex in maintaining genome stability and preventing aberrant immune responses. Our findings highlight ribonuclease H2 as a potential therapeutic target for the management of Aicardi-Goutières syndrome and other related autoimmune disorders.
