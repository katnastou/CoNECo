prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: surface IgG3. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we investigated the role of the surface IgG3 protein complex in the pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis. We utilized a murine model to examine the effects of various chemical agents on the expression and activation of surface IgG3 in the synovial tissues of arthritic joints. Our results indicate a significant upregulation of surface IgG3 in the presence of interleukin-6, a pro-inflammatory cytokine associated with rheumatoid arthritis. Interestingly, we observed a concomitant increase in the severity of arthritis symptoms in the treated mice, suggesting a potential correlation between surface IgG3 activation and disease progression. These findings may provide valuable insights into the mechanistic underpinnings of rheumatoid arthritis and pave the way for the development of targeted therapies aimed at modulating surface IgG3 activity in the synovium.
