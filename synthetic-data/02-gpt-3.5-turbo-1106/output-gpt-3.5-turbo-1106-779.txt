prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: mini RTC. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The mini RTC protein complex is a crucial mediator of mitochondrial respiratory function and energy production. Recent studies have highlighted the role of mini RTC in the pathogenesis of mitochondrial diseases, such as Leigh syndrome and mitochondrial encephalomyopathy. Dysfunction of the mini RTC has been associated with impaired electron transport chain activity and reduced ATP synthesis, leading to cellular energy deficits and tissue damage. Furthermore, the mini RTC has been shown to interact with various small molecules and cofactors, including ubiquinone and cytochrome c, to facilitate efficient electron transfer within the mitochondrial respiratory chain. Understanding the molecular mechanisms governing the assembly and regulation of the mini RTC may provide novel therapeutic targets for mitigating mitochondrial dysfunction and associated diseases.
