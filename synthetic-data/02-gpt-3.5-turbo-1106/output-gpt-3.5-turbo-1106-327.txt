prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: MitOSs. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In recent years, the role of the MitOSs protein complex has been a topic of significant interest in the field of mitochondrial research. MitOSs has been implicated in the regulation of mitochondrial function and dynamics in both healthy and diseased states. Recent studies have identified a potential connection between MitOSs and the progression of neurodegenerative disorders such as Parkinson's disease and Huntington's disease. Additionally, the interaction between MitOSs and certain chemical compounds, such as kinase inhibitors and reactive oxygen species, has raised questions about the potential for therapeutic targeting of MitOSs in the context of mitochondrial dysfunction. Further investigation into the molecular mechanisms underlying MitOSs function and its potential as a therapeutic target is warranted to advance our understanding of mitochondrial biology and potential treatment options for associated diseases.
