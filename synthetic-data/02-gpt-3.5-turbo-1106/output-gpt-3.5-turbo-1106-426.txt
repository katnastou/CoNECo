prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose-2,6-biphosphatase 2. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we investigated the role of the 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose-2,6-biphosphatase 2 (Pfkfb2) protein complex in the regulation of glucose metabolism in the context of type 2 diabetes. Using a murine model of insulin resistance, we observed a significant upregulation of Pfkfb2 expression and enzymatic activity in the liver and skeletal muscle tissues. Furthermore, we found that inhibition of Pfkfb2 activity led to decreased glucose uptake and glycolytic flux in adipose tissue, indicating the importance of this protein complex in the pathogenesis of insulin resistance. Our findings suggest that targeting Pfkfb2 may represent a potential therapeutic approach for managing glucose dysregulation in type 2 diabetes.
