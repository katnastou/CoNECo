prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: DX2. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we aimed to elucidate the role of the DX2 protein complex in the progression of colorectal cancer. Using a combination of immunoprecipitation, mass spectrometry, and functional assays, we identified several potential interacting partners of the DX2 complex, including proteins involved in DNA repair and cell cycle regulation. Furthermore, our investigation revealed that the expression levels of the DX2 complex were significantly elevated in colorectal cancer tissues compared to adjacent normal tissues. Importantly, knockdown of DX2 complex components resulted in suppressed cell proliferation and increased apoptotic cell death in colorectal cancer cell lines. Our findings suggest that the DX2 complex may play a critical role in the pathogenesis of colorectal cancer and could serve as a potential therapeutic target for this malignancy.
