prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: CBM. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: Recent studies have highlighted the potential of the CBM complex in mediating immune responses in the context of autoimmune diseases. The CBM complex has been shown to play a crucial role in regulating the activation and function of immune cells, including T cells and B cells. Dysregulation of the CBM complex has been associated with the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis and systemic lupus erythematosus. Furthermore, targeting the CBM complex has emerged as a promising therapeutic strategy for modulating immune responses and ameliorating autoimmune conditions. These findings underscore the importance of further investigating the molecular mechanisms underlying the function of the CBM complex and its potential as a therapeutic target for autoimmune diseases.
