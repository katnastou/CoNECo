prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: VPS4A/B. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The endosomal protein sorting machinery plays a critical role in regulating cellular processes such as membrane trafficking and the degradation of cell surface receptors. In this study, we investigated the role of the VPS4A/B complex in endosomal sorting. Using a combination of chemical inhibition and genetic knockdown approaches, we found that disruption of VPS4A/B activity leads to defects in endosome maturation and the formation of multivesicular bodies. Furthermore, our findings suggest that VPS4A/B dysfunction may contribute to the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's. These results highlight the importance of the VPS4A/B complex in maintaining normal endosomal function and provide insights into potential therapeutic targets for diseases associated with endosomal dysfunction.
