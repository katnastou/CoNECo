prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: polarisome. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The polarisome is a multimeric protein complex involved in the establishment and maintenance of cell polarity in various eukaryotic organisms, including budding yeast and filamentous fungi. Studies have implicated the polarisome in the regulation of actin cytoskeleton organization and dynamics, as well as in the formation of polarized growth at the cell cortex. The polarisome has been shown to interact with various regulators of cell polarity, such as small GTPases and the Rho-type GTPase Cdc42. Dysfunction of the polarisome has been linked to defects in polarized growth and cellular morphogenesis, contributing to the pathology of certain human diseases, including developmental disorders and cancer metastasis. Understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying polarisome function may provide valuable insights into the development of therapeutic strategies for diseases associated with aberrant cell polarity.
