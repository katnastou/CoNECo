prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: CHRAC. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The chromatin accessibility complex (CHRAC) is a critical component in the regulation of chromatin structure and accessibility. Through its role in nucleosome remodeling and maintenance of proper spatial organization of chromatin, CHRAC contributes to the regulation of gene expression and cellular processes. Dysfunction of CHRAC has been linked to various pathologies, including cancer and developmental disorders. The intricate interplay between CHRAC and other chromatin remodeling complexes, as well as the influence of histone modifications and transcription factors on CHRAC activity, highlights the complex regulatory networks governing chromatin dynamics and gene expression. Understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying CHRAC function will provide valuable insights into the etiology of various diseases and may open new avenues for therapeutic interventions targeting chromatin regulation.
