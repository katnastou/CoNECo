prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: IL-9 receptor. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The IL-9 receptor is a pivotal molecular target involved in the pathogenesis of allergic diseases, such as bronchial asthma and allergic rhinitis. This receptor complex is known for its central role in mediating the pro-inflammatory effects of interleukin-9, a cytokine predominantly produced by Th9 cells. Activation of the IL-9 receptor complex leads to the recruitment and activation of various immune cells, including mast cells, eosinophils, and T lymphocytes, contributing to the development and progression of allergic inflammation. Given its significance in allergic diseases, the IL-9 receptor complex has emerged as a promising therapeutic target for the management of allergic disorders. Studies exploring the modulation of IL-9 receptor signaling pathways offer potential avenues for the development of novel therapies aimed at mitigating allergic responses and improving clinical outcomes in affected individuals.
