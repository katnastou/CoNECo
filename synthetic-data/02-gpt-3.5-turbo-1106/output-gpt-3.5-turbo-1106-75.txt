prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: NatA. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The NatA protein complex is a highly conserved N-terminal acetyltransferase enzyme that exerts crucial roles in various cellular processes. Recent studies have demonstrated the involvement of NatA in the regulation of protein stability, cellular proliferation, and cell migration. Dysregulation or mutation of NatA has been implicated in a wide range of pathologies, including cancer, neurodegenerative diseases, and developmental disorders. Furthermore, the identification of small molecule inhibitors targeting NatA has provided potential therapeutic avenues for treating NatA-associated diseases. Understanding the intricate regulatory mechanisms of NatA and its implications in disease pathogenesis is of paramount importance in the development of targeted therapeutic interventions. Therefore, further investigations into the molecular mechanisms governing NatA function and dysregulation are warranted for the development of innovative treatment strategies for NatA-related diseases.
