prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: p28. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: Recent studies have highlighted the potential of targeting the p28 protein complex in the treatment of metastatic melanoma. Metastatic melanoma remains a challenging clinical problem, as it is associated with high mortality rates. The p28 protein complex has been shown to play a crucial role in promoting the growth and spread of melanoma cells. Inhibition of the p28 protein complex using small molecule inhibitors has demonstrated promising results in preclinical models, leading to reduced tumor growth and increased sensitivity to chemotherapeutic agents. These findings offer a novel therapeutic strategy for the treatment of metastatic melanoma and warrant further investigation in clinical trials.
