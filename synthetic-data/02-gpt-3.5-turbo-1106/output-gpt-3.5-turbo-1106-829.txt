prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: EFF-1. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The EFF-1 protein complex plays a crucial role in mediating cell fusion events during embryonic development in Caenorhabditis elegans. Recent studies have shown that mutations in the EFF-1 gene result in defective cell fusion processes, leading to abnormal morphogenesis and embryonic lethality in the nematode. Furthermore, the regulation of EFF-1 activity is dependent on the interaction with specific lipid molecules in the plasma membrane, highlighting the intricate interplay between protein complexes and lipid components in cellular fusion events. Understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying EFF-1 function could have implications for addressing human diseases characterized by dysregulated cell fusion, such as certain types of cancer and viral infections. Further investigations into the precise molecular interactions and signaling pathways involving EFF-1 are warranted to reveal potential therapeutic targets for modulating cell fusion events in both physiological and pathological contexts.
