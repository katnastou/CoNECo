prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: IL-13 receptor. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we investigated the role of the IL-13 receptor in the pathogenesis of asthma. Our results demonstrate a complex interaction between IL-13 receptor signaling and the downstream activation of inflammatory pathways in airway epithelial cells. Furthermore, we found that chemical inhibition of the IL-13 receptor effectively attenuated airway inflammation in a murine model of asthma. These findings suggest that targeting the IL-13 receptor may hold promise as a therapeutic strategy for the treatment of asthma and related respiratory diseases. Our study provides valuable insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying IL-13 receptor-mediated inflammation and lays the groundwork for further exploration of this promising therapeutic target.
