prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: CPSF. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In recent years, there has been growing interest in the role of the CPSF protein complex in the regulation of gene expression in various disease states. Research suggests that aberrant CPSF activity may contribute to the progression of certain cancers, such as breast cancer and prostate cancer. Furthermore, it has been observed that chemical inhibitors targeting the CPSF complex have shown promise in preclinical studies, highlighting the therapeutic potential of CPSF modulation in cancer treatment. Additionally, genetic studies in model organisms have provided valuable insights into the physiological significance of CPSF in development and immune responses. These findings underscore the importance of further elucidating the molecular mechanisms underlying CPSF function and its potential as a therapeutic target for various human diseases.
