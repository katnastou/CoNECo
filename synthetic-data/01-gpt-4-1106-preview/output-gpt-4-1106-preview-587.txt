prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: electron transport complex III. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: Electron Transport Complex III plays a pivotal role in the mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation system, where it facilitates the transfer of electrons from ubiquinol to cytochrome c while simultaneously translocating protons across the mitochondrial membrane to establish a proton motive force essential for ATP synthesis. This multiprotein complex has been the subject of rigorous research due to its implications in various metabolic disorders. Recent studies using human tissue samples have further delineated its function, revealing insights into age-related declines in efficiency and its potential involvement in the pathophysiology of Parkinson's disease. These findings suggest that therapeutic modulation of Electron Transport Complex III activity may offer a novel approach for alleviating mitochondrial dysfunction-specific symptoms. Furthermore, advanced investigation into the complex's three-dimensional structure, using cryo-electron microscopy, has provided a better understanding of the binding sites for ubiquinol and subsequent electron transfer pathways. Additional research is warranted to delineate the complex's dynamics and regulatory mechanisms, which are crucial for the development of targeted interventions aimed at restoring mitochondrial function in diseases characterized by compromised Electron Transport Complex III activity.
