prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: p28. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In a recent study, we aimed to elucidate the role of p28 in the cellular pathways underpinning neurodegenerative diseases. Immunoprecipitation assays followed by mass spectrometry revealed a direct interaction between p28 and specific neurotransmitter receptors, suggesting that p28 may modulate synaptic transmission. Further investigations using cell cultures derived from Mus musculus models subjected to oxidative stress—a condition mimicking aspects of Parkinson's disease—demonstrated that the stability of p28 is compromised in the presence of elevated levels of reactive oxygen species. This destabilization was concomitant with an increase in synaptic dysfunction and neuronal loss. Complementary to these findings, pharmacological interventions with antioxidants led to an amelioration of p28 degradation and resulted in a marked decrease in disease phenotypes, indicating a potential therapeutic avenue. The results of this study imply that the maintenance of p28 integrity could be pivotal in preserving neuronal function and preventing the progression of neurodegenerative pathologies.
