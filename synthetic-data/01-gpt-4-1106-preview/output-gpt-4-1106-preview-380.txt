prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: ASTRA. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In a recent study, we investigated the role of the Apoptosis STimulatory of p53 Activity (ASTRA) complex in the regulation of cellular response to oxidative stress. Our results demonstrate that the presence of ASTRA is critical for the upregulation of antioxidant pathways in human fibroblast cells. Upon exposure to hydrogen peroxide, cells with intact ASTRA complexes showed a marked increase in the expression of key oxidative stress response genes, compared with cells in which the ASTRA complex was knocked down. Interestingly, ASTRA's function appears to be modulated by the cellular concentration of NADPH, suggesting that ASTRA may act as a sensor for the redox state of the cell. Moreover, in a murine model, the disruption of the ASTRA complex led to an enhanced susceptibility to myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury, underscoring the physiological relevance of ASTRA in tissue protection mechanisms. These findings underscore the therapeutic potential of targeting ASTRA for the treatment of diseases characterized by oxidative damage, such as Parkinson's disease and atherosclerosis, offering promising avenues for future drug development.
