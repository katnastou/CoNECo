prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: IL-12. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: Interleukin-12 (IL-12) is a pivotal cytokine in mediating cellular immunity due to its role in the differentiation of naive T cells into Th1 cells, which are instrumental in orchestrating the immune response against various intracellular pathogens. The therapeutic potential of IL-12 has been explored in the context of infectious disorders, malignancies, and autoimmune diseases. For instance, in experimental murine models, administration of IL-12 has shown promise in enhancing the immune response to Mycobacterium tuberculosis, indicating its possible utility as an adjunctive immunotherapy in treating tuberculosis. Furthermore, IL-12's antitumor activity has been evaluated in several cancers, highlighting its ability to induce cytotoxic T cells and natural killer cell-mediated tumor clearance. However, the clinical application of IL-12 is complicated by its potential to induce severe side effects, including systemic inflammation, necessitating the development of delivery systems and strategies that can localize IL-12 action to the tumor microenvironment to minimize systemic exposure. Current research efforts are also focused on deciphering the regulatory mechanisms governing IL-12 production and activity, which may offer novel insights into the modulation of the immune response for therapeutic benefit.
