prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: GET. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The Guided Entry of Tail-anchored proteins (GET) complex plays a critical role in the post-translational targeting of integral membrane proteins with a single C-terminal transmembrane domain to the endoplasmic reticulum. In a recent study, the effects of the GET complex on the efficient localization of these proteins were elucidated through a series of in vitro assays using Saccharomyces cerevisiae as a model organism. The reliance on the GET system for tail-anchored protein stability became particularly evident when observing cellular stress responses under treatment with tunicamycin, which induces unfolded protein response in the endoplasmic reticulum. Interestingly, disruptions of the GET complex not only impaired the insertion of tail-anchored proteins but also exhibited a broader impact on cellular homeostasis, suggesting its potential involvement in additional cellular processes beyond protein targeting. Given the conservation of this complex across species, further investigations into its role in protein homeostasis may illuminate novel therapeutic targets for diseases characterized by protein mislocalization and aggregation, such as certain neurodegenerative disorders.
