prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: MCM4/6/7. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In the current study, we sought to elucidate the mechanism by which the MCM4/6/7 complex contributes to the maintenance of genomic integrity in Saccharomyces cerevisiae during the S phase of the cell cycle. The MCM4/6/7 complex has been previously characterized as an essential helicase for the unwinding of DNA, which permits the advancement of the replication fork. Our experiments focused on identifying the effects of reactive oxygen species on the stability of the MCM4/6/7 complex. Cultures were subjected to oxidative stress through the introduction of hydrogen peroxide, after which we assessed the functionality of the complex via chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing. The results revealed a significant decrease in the association of the MCM4/6/7 complex with replication origins in treated cells compared to the control. This reduction correlated with an increased frequency of replication errors, as evaluated by next-generation sequencing. Our data suggest that the integrity of the MCM4/6/7 complex is compromised under oxidative stress, leading to a heightened risk for genomic mutations that could potentially contribute to the progression of oncogenesis. These findings underscore the vital role of MCM4/6/7 in safeguarding the genome during replication and hint at potential interventions that may bolster its function under adverse conditions.
