prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: WASP and Scar homologue. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In the elucidation of signaling pathways that govern actin cytoskeleton remodeling, particular attention has been afforded to the role played by the WASP and Scar homologue in cellular processes. Accumulating evidence indicates that this protein complex is pivotally involved in the orchestration of polymerization events, facilitating actin assembly at the leading edge of migrating cells. Studies utilizing advanced fluorescence microscopy have observed the colocalization of the WASP and Scar homologue with dynamic actin structures, particularly within the lamellipodia of fibroblasts responding to extracellular stimuli. Further biochemical elucidation revealed that upon activation, this protein complex interacts with actin nucleation promoting factors, substantially increasing the rate of actin monomer incorporation into filaments. Moreover, in assays using pharmacological inhibitors, the role of the WASP and Scar homologue has been demonstrated to be critical for cellular responses to gradients of chemotactic agents, thereby implicating it in physiologically relevant mechanisms of directed cell migration. Investigations into the underpinnings of wound healing have likewise highlighted the protein complex's contribution to tissue repair processes. However, dysregulation of its activity has been implicated in an array of disease states, supporting the premise that the WASP and Scar homologue constitutes a potential therapeutic target for the modulation of disorders characterized by aberrant cell motility.
