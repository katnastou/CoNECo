prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: APOBECs. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The multifaceted roles of APOBECs in antiviral defense mechanisms have become increasingly evident in recent years, particularly in the context of retroviral infections. Originating from a family of cytidine deaminases, APOBECs have demonstrated a capacity for inducing hypermutation within viral genomes, thereby thwarting the replication fidelity of retroviruses such as HIV. Through this intrinsic immune response, APOBECs effectuate the deamination of cytosine to uracil during viral DNA synthesis, interrupting the replication process. However, these proteins also pose a double-edged sword, as their mutagenic potential extends beyond viral targets to host genomes, raising concerns about implications in genomic stability and the pathogenesis of cancer. Recent studies have elucidated the molecular determinants that underpin APOBECs specificity and catalytic proficiency, providing insights into their modus operandi. Therapeutic strategies are being investigated that harness the antiviral capabilities of APOBECs, alongside exploring mechanisms to mitigate their unintended genotoxic effects. This promising yet cautious approach underscores the need for a nuanced understanding of APOBECs within the larger framework of host-pathogen interactions and cellular homeostasis.
