prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: CoQ-synthome. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In the recent study published in the Journal of Molecular Biology, we have elucidated the pivotal role of the CoQ-synthome in mitochondrial ubiquinone biosynthesis. Mitochondrial health is crucial for cellular energy production, particularly through oxidative phosphorylation, which is significantly affected by the presence of ubiquinone or coenzyme Q10. The CoQ-synthome, a multi-protein complex localized within the mitochondrial inner membrane, is integral for the final steps of ubiquinone synthesis. Our research utilized a combination of cryo-electron microscopy and targeted metabolomics to analyze the impact of disrupted CoQ-synthome activity on mitochondrial function. Patients with mitochondrial myopathies, a subset of metabolic disorders, were found to exhibit reduced CoQ-synthome stability, correlating with decreased levels of ubiquinone. This deficit was particularly pronounced in the muscle tissues of these patients, suggesting a link between CoQ-synthome dysfunction and the pathophysiology of mitochondrial myopathies. Therapeutic strategies enhancing CoQ-synthome stability or function could potentially ameliorate the ubiquinone deficiency observed in these diseases, highlighting the potential for targeted interventions in the metabolic management of affected individuals.
