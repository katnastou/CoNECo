prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: interleukin-12 receptor. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In a recent study investigating the immunological responses implicated in the pathogenesis of autoimmune disorders, the interleukin-12 receptor emerged as a pivotal element of interest. This receptor, which is expressed on the surface of T cells and natural killer (NK) cells, plays a crucial role in mediating the effects of its ligand, promoting a Th1 immune response critical in defending against intracellular pathogens. Functionally, the engagement of the interleukin-12 receptor initiates a cascade of intracellular signaling events leading to the transcription of genes involved in inflammation and cellular immunity. Patients with defective signaling through this receptor have been observed to exhibit increased susceptibility to infectious diseases, most notably of bacterial and viral etiology. In contrast, hyperactivity of the interleukin-12 receptor pathway has been correlated with heightened inflammatory responses, contributing to the clinical manifestations observed in conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis and inflammatory bowel disease. The elucidation of the exact mechanisms governing the interleukin-12 receptor's expression and function may lead to the development of novel therapeutic targets, offering relief for patients suffering from a variety of immune-mediated disorders.
