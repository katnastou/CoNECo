prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: cytosolic FAS. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In recent investigations into lipid metabolic pathways, the role of cytosolic FAS has been a focal point for understanding the regulation of de novo lipogenesis in mammalian cells. This research, conducted through a series of in vitro assays and corroborated by murine models, has revealed that cytosolic FAS activity is tightly linked to energy homeostasis and is significantly upregulated in response to caloric excess. Notably, the overexpression of cytosolic FAS has been implicated in the pathogenesis of hepatic steatosis, a condition commonly associated with metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes mellitus. Further biochemical analysis has demonstrated that the activity of cytosolic FAS is modulated by the availability of its substrates, primarily acetyl-CoA and malonyl-CoA, which in turn are influenced by the cellular nutritional status. In addition, pharmacological inhibition of cytosolic FAS has shown promise in reducing lipid accumulation in hepatocytes, suggesting a potential therapeutic avenue for the treatment of hepatic lipid disorders. This intricate balance underscores the complex nature of metabolic regulation and points to cytosolic FAS as a critical node in the broader metabolic network, with substantial implications for understanding and potentially mitigating the metabolic dysfunctions that underpin various human diseases.
