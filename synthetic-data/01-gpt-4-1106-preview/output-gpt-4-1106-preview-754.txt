prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: CRL3. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: Recent advancements in the understanding of ubiquitin-proteasome system-dependent protein degradation have underscored the significant role of CRL3 in the regulation of cellular homeostasis. The purpose of this study was to further elucidate the mechanistic pathways by which CRL3 influences the turnover of key regulatory proteins implicated in neoplastic transformation. Utilizing a combination of mass spectrometry, cellular assays, and in vivo mouse models, we have explored the impact of post-translational modifications on the functionality of CRL3. Our findings reveal that phosphorylation events modulate the substrate specificity and ligase activity of CRL3. Moreover, pharmacological inhibition of upstream kinases resulted in the stabilization of proteins that are normally targeted for degradation, leading to impaired cell cycle progression and reduced tumor growth in our murine models. These results highlight the therapeutic potential of targeting CRL3-mediated degradation pathways in the treatment of cancer and offer insights into the complex regulatory networks that maintain cellular protein composition. Further studies are warranted to identify the full repertoire of substrates affected by CRL3, as such knowledge will deepen our comprehension of its role in the pathogenesis of various diseases and inform the development of novel therapeutic strategies.
