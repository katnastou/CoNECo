prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: 13S condensin. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In recent studies, the 13S condensin protein complex has garnered substantial interest due to its crucial role in chromosomal architecture and segregation during mitosis and meiosis. Investigations into the functional dynamics of 13S condensin have revealed its integral involvement in the condensation of chromosomes, an essential process ensuring accurate genetic material distribution to daughter cells. This protein complex operates by introducing supercoils into the DNA structure, thereby compacting the chromosome to facilitate efficient separation. Perturbations in the activity of 13S condensin are hypothesized to contribute to genomic instability, a hallmark of numerous cancers. To elucidate the mechanistic pathways underpinning this phenomenon, cell culture assays have been employed using human epithelial cells. Furthermore, fluorescence microscopy techniques have enabled the visualization of 13S condensin's spatial and temporal distribution during the cell cycle, providing insights into its regulatory mechanisms. Collectively, these findings support the proposition that precise modulation of 13S condensin activity is imperative for chromosomal integrity and holds potential therapeutic implications for the treatment of chromosomal aberration-related diseases.
