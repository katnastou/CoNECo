prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: SufS. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In a recent inquiry into the molecular underpinnings of cellular stress response mechanisms, the role of the iron-sulfur cluster assembly protein complex SufS has been elucidated through a series of biochemical assays and structural analyses. Initial investigations observed that cells subjected to oxidative stress exhibited a marked increase in SufS expression, hinting at a potential involvement in the mitigation of reactive oxygen species. Subsequent experiments involved the incubation of purified SufS with substrates commonly associated with sulfur mobilization, resulting in the formation of a sulfurated intermediate. Moreover, in vivo studies using the model organism Escherichia coli demonstrated that depletion of SufS led to a discernible decrease in cellular viability under iron-starvation conditions, suggesting that this protein complex may be implicated in iron homeostasis. The implications of these findings for human health are particularly relevant given that disruptions of iron-sulfur cluster biogenesis are increasingly linked to a host of pathologies ranging from neurodegeneration to myopathy. While the complete biochemical pathway of SufS in the context of these diseases remains to be fully charted, the current data unequivocally establishes SufS as a critical node in the cellular response to iron-related stress.
