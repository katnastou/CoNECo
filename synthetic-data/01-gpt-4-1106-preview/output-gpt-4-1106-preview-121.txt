prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: NACA. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we sought to elucidate the role of the NACA protein complex in the cellular response to oxidative stress, a common pathological condition underlying various neurodegenerative diseases. Initially, we assessed the expression levels of NACA in human neuronal cell lines exposed to hydrogen peroxide, a known inducer of oxidative damage. Quantitative PCR and Western blot analyses consistently showed an upregulation of NACA following the treatment, suggesting a potential protective mechanism against cellular stress. Subsequently, to determine the physiological relevance of NACA upregulation, we utilized CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing to generate cell lines with a targeted disruption of the NACA complex. The NACA- deficient cells exhibited a significantly increased susceptibility to oxidative stress-induced apoptosis, as evidenced by flow cytometry and caspase-3 activity assays. In parallel, biochemical studies demonstrated that the presence of NACA was essential for the stabilization of mitochondrial membrane potential and the reduction of reactive oxygen species accumulation. These findings highlight the critical function of the NACA complex in maintaining cellular homeostasis and implicate its potential as a therapeutic target in conditions where oxidative stress is a contributing factor.
