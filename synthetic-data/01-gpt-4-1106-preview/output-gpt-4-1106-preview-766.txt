prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: artPIQM. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In recent studies, the novel protein complex artPIQM has garnered considerable attention due to its implication in cellular autophagy processes. A meticulous analysis utilizing cutting-edge cryo-electron microscopy techniques revealed that artPIQM possesses a unique quaternary structure, which facilitates the recruitment of autophagy-related vesicles. Further biochemical assays have demonstrated artPIQM's affinity for phospholipid membranes, suggesting a potential role in membrane curvature stabilization during autophagosome formation. Intriguingly, investigations into the expression patterns of artPIQM across different tissue types indicate a pronounced upregulation in hepatic cells upon exposure to oxidative stress, which points to its possible involvement in liver homeostasis. Notably, animal models with induced diabetic phenotypes exhibited altered artPIQM activity, correlating with aberrant autophagic flux, hinting at its therapeutic potential in the management of diabetes-related complications. The complex interplay between artPIQM function and cellular metabolic states thereby presents a promising avenue for therapeutic intervention in metabolic disorders. Consequently, ongoing research endeavors are now focused on deciphering the precise molecular mechanisms underpinning artPIQM-mediated autophagy and its broader implications for human health.
