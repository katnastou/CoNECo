prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: preprimosome. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In the recent study published in the Journal of Cellular Biochemistry, we examined the role of the preprimosome in the initiation of DNA replication under various stress conditions. The preprimosome, a multisubunit protein complex essential for the unwinding of double-stranded DNA, was isolated and its activity was assessed in the presence of reactive oxygen species (ROS), a byproduct of cellular metabolism known to induce DNA damage. Human embryonic kidney (HEK) cells were employed as the model system, given their robust replication machinery and relevance to human biology. Exposure to ROS led to a marked decrease in preprimosome activity, as measured by a novel fluorescence-based helicase assay. Consistent with this observation, cells subjected to oxidative stress exhibited a higher frequency of replication fork stalling and an increased incidence of genome instability. The implications of these findings for diseases characterized by elevated oxidative stress, such as cancer and neurodegenerative disorders, were discussed in the context of DNA replication fidelity and cellular homeostasis. This work provides insight into the mechanisms by which the preprimosome maintains genomic integrity in a challenging cellular environment and underscores the potential for targeting this complex in disease intervention strategies.
