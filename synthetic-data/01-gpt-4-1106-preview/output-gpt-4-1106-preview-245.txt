prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: YdcSTUV. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In a recent study, we characterized the interaction of the newly identified protein complex YdcSTUV with specific intracellular signaling pathways in the context of colorectal cancer (CRC) progression. The YdcSTUV complex was purified from human colorectal cancer cell lines using affinity chromatography followed by mass spectrometry analysis to confirm its integrity and composition. Functional assays revealed that YdcSTUV modulates the activity of key signaling molecules involved in cell proliferation and apoptosis. Treatment of CRC cells with 5-fluorouracil, a chemotherapeutic agent, resulted in altered localization of YdcSTUV, suggesting a potential role in drug response. Further investigations using RNA interference indicated that the knockdown of YdcSTUV significantly decreased cancer cell viability, pointing to its importance in CRC cell survival. Collectively, these findings suggest that YdcSTUV may play a critical role in the modulation of cellular pathways involved in CRC, and it may represent a novel target for therapeutic intervention. Subsequent in vivo studies are warranted to evaluate the effects of YdcSTUV manipulation on tumor growth and chemotherapy resistance.
