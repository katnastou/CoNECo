prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: IKK. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we aimed to elucidate the functional role of the IKK complex in inflammatory signaling pathways. Our investigation utilized both in vitro assays and mouse models to examine the impact of selective IKK inhibition on cytokine production following lipopolysaccharide (LPS) exposure. We observed that treatment with selective small molecule inhibitors of IKK led to a significant reduction in the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as TNF-α and IL-6, indicating the involvement of IKK in the NF-κB signaling cascade upstream of these cytokines. Moreover, in a murine model of rheumatoid arthritis, administration of the IKK inhibitor precluded the development of pathologic symptoms, thereby suggesting a potential therapeutic role for IKK inhibition in the treatment of inflammatory diseases. Interestingly, further analyses revealed that IKK's contribution to inflammation extends beyond the classical pathways, implicating this complex in the regulation of additional signaling mechanisms which warrant further investigation. Collectively, our results underscore the centrality of IKK in inflammatory responses and offer insights into its potential as a target for pharmacological intervention.
