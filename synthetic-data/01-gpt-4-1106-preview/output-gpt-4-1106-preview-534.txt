prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: BC. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In the current study, we elucidated the role of the novel protein complex BC in the pathology of Alzheimer's disease. Specifically, we conducted a series of in vitro experiments using primary neuronal cultures derived from murine models to assess the impact of BC on amyloid-beta accumulation. Upon the application of various chemical inhibitors known to affect proteasome activity, we observed a marked reduction in the proteolytic degradation of amyloid-beta, hinting at a potential regulatory function of BC in this critical pathway. Furthermore, immunoprecipitation followed by mass spectrometry allowed us to investigate the interactome of BC, revealing several potential binding partners that are integral to cellular homeostasis. Interestingly, the expression levels of BC were found to be significantly altered in brain tissue samples obtained from patients with Alzheimer's disease compared to age-matched controls, as quantified by Western blot analysis. This correlation underscores the necessity for thorough examination of BC's biological function and its therapeutic potential as a target for arresting the progression of this debilitating neurological condition.
