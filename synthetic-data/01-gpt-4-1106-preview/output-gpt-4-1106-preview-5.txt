prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: TBC. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: Recent studies have elucidated the critical role of the TBC complex in mediating intracellular signaling pathways. This multi-component complex has been demonstrated to have significant implications for the regulation of cellular metabolism. In vitro assays, employing a variety of cell lines derived from Homo sapiens, have shown that the TBC complex modulates the activity of key metabolic enzymes, thereby influencing the cellular response to energetic demands. Furthermore, treatments with pharmacological agents that specifically target the TBC complex have illustrated a potential therapeutic avenue for metabolic disorders, such as diabetes mellitus. These agents have exhibited promising results in preliminary clinical trials, where they appear to restore metabolic homeostasis by fine-tuning the action of the TBC complex. The biochemical characterisation of the TBC complex has thus become an increasingly important focus for research, with the potential to unlock novel insights into the pathophysiology of metabolic diseases and to pave the way for innovative therapeutic strategies.
