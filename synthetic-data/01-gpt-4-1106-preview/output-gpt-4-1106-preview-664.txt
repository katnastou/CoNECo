prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: DNMT3A–3L. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: Recent advancements in the field of epigenetics have highlighted the pivotal role of DNMT3A–3L in the intricate regulation of gene expression. This protein complex is believed to be deeply involved in the establishment and maintenance of DNA methylation patterns, a key epigenetic mark that influences cellular identity and function. Elevated expression of DNMT3A–3L has been documented in certain malignancies, suggesting a potential oncogenic propensity. Furthermore, research using murine models has revealed that dysregulation of this complex may contribute to developmental abnormalities, implicating it in a host of congenital disorders. In the context of neural differentiation, the role of DNMT3A–3L has been characterized by its site-specific interaction with genomic loci, thereby affecting neuronal plasticity and potentially impacting the progression of neurodegenerative diseases. Investigations employing CRISPR-Cas9 mediated gene editing have enabled a more nuanced understanding of its function, while pharmacological interventions targeting the enzymatic activity of DNMT3A–3L are being explored as therapeutic avenues for conditions characterized by aberrant methylation patterns. Thus, DNMT3A–3L emerges as a crucial player in the epigenetic orchestra, orchestrating DNA methylation landscapes that have far-reaching implications for both physiology and pathology.
