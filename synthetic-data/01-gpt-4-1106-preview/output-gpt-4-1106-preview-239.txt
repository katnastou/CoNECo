prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: H-gal-GP. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we sought to characterize the regulatory role of H-gal-GP in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) progression. Quantitative proteomics analysis demonstrated an upregulation of H-gal-GP in tissue samples derived from HCC patients as compared with adjacent non-tumorous liver tissues. Immunohistochemical staining patterns correlated with patient clinical outcomes, showing that elevated levels of H-gal-GP were significantly associated with a decrease in overall survival. Subsequent in vitro assays involving selective inhibition of H-gal-GP in HepG2 and Huh7 cell lines provided insights into its possible mechanisms of action. The inhibition of H-gal-GP led to marked reductions in cellular proliferation and migration, suggesting its critical role in hepatocarcinogenesis. Additionally, the treatment of cells with a panel of chemotherapeutic agents, including sorafenib and doxorubicin, revealed that H-gal-GP might modulate therapeutic response, as evidenced by differential cytotoxic profiles in the presence of H-gal-GP inhibitors. This highlights the potential of H-gal-GP as a novel therapeutic target in HCC and paves the way for future investigations into the molecular pathways mediated by this protein complex.
