prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: MAC. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In elucidating the immune response pathways, recent studies have uncovered the intricate role of the membrane attack complex (MAC) in host defense mechanisms against pathogens. This intricate protein complex is central to the complement system, which acts as a nexus between innate and adaptive immunity. The activation of the complement cascade culminates in the assembly of MAC, which then inserts into the lipid bilayer of target cells, forming a lytic pore. It is this pore-forming activity that is responsible for the lysis of foreign pathogens such as bacteria, as well as virally-infected cells, ensuring the clearance of these invaders from the circulation. While its role is crucial in combating infections, dysregulation of MAC has been implicated in a variety of pathophysiological states, notably autoimmune diseases. For instance, aberrant MAC formation on host cells has been observed in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), suggesting a detrimental effect of excessive complement activation on self-tissues. Moreover, therapeutic interventions aimed at modulating MAC activity are currently under exploration, with the goal of harnessing its protective functions while mitigating collateral damage to host cells. The intricate balance of MAC formation and regulation thus represents a significant frontier in the treatment of immunological disorders.
