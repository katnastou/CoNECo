prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: cullin-RING ligase 3. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In a recent study published in the Journal of Cellular Biochemistry, investigators sought to delineate the regulatory mechanisms underpinning ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis in response to oxidative stress, with a particular focus on the role of cullin-RING ligase 3 (CRL3). Utilizing both in vitro and in vivo models, the research team examined the influence of reactive oxygen species (ROS) on the activity of CRL3, positing that post-translational modifications induced by oxidative conditions may alter the ligase's function. Elevated ROS levels were chemically induced in murine hepatocytes through exposure to hydrogen peroxide, whereas antioxidant treatments with N-acetyl cysteine served as a control to mitigate oxidative stress. Subsequent assays revealed a marked increase in ubiquitination profiles coincident with heightened ROS, suggesting a possible enhancement of CRL3-mediated ubiquitin conjugation to its target substrates. Intriguingly, this increase in ubiquitination was correlated with a decline in cellular viability, underscoring the potential for CRL3 to mediate proteolytic pathways implicated in oxidative damage and cell death. Given the known involvement of ubiquitin-dependent degradation in various pathologies, these findings provide an important insight into the molecular dynamics governing cellular responses to oxidative stress and may open avenues for therapeutic intervention in diseases characterized by dysregulated proteolysis.
