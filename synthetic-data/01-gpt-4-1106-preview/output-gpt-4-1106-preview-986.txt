prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: IDH3. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In the current study, we sought to elucidate the role of the mitochondrial protein complex IDH3 in the context of cellular metabolism and its implications in neurodegenerative disorders. Specifically, we conducted a series of in vitro assays using cultured neuronal cells to assess the impact of IDH3 activity on the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle. Our results demonstrated that robust IDH3 function is indispensable for the maintenance of optimal TCA cycle flux, as evidenced by the accumulation of upstream metabolites upon its inhibition. Additional experiments in a mouse model revealed a distinct correlation between decreased IDH3 activity and the exacerbation of pathological phenotypes associated with Alzheimer's disease. These findings suggest that IDH3 not only plays a critical role in basal mitochondrial function but may also confer neuroprotective effects, potentially through the modulation of oxidative stress responses. Collectively, our data underscore the importance of IDH3 in maintaining neuronal health and provide a compelling rationale for further exploration of its therapeutic potential in mitigating the onset or progression of neurodegenerative diseases.
