prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: HEX S. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In a recent endeavor to delineate the mechanisms underpinning cellular metabolism in pathological states, a novel protein complex designated HEX S has garnered substantial interest. This complex has demonstrated a pivotal role in the modulation of enzymatic activities that are integral to the regulation of glycolytic flux. Investigations employing various model organisms, ranging from *C. elegans* to *Mus musculus*, have shed light on the contribution of HEX S to metabolic homeostasis and its potential dysregulation in the context of metabolic syndrome. Biochemical assays revealed that HEX S interacts with a constellation of metabolic intermediates, suggesting a multifaceted regulatory function. Notably, the aberrant expression of HEX S has been correlated with an increased incidence of insulin resistance, further implicating its significance in disease progression. Subsequent pharmacological experiments have centered on the modulation of HEX S activity, employing small molecules with the intent to restore metabolic equilibrium and mitigate the effects of insulin resistance. Preliminary in vivo studies have yielded promising results, underlining the therapeutic potential of targeting HEX S. Collectively, these findings offer a tantalizing glimpse into the role of HEX S in cellular metabolism, with implications that could transcend our understanding of metabolic disorders.
