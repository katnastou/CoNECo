prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: editosomes. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: Recent advances in the elucidation of RNA editing mechanisms have brought the functional dynamics of editosomes into the spotlight. Found predominantly in kinetoplastid protozoans, these macromolecular complexes are instrumental in the post-transcriptional modification of mitochondrial mRNAs, an essential process for the survival and infectivity of these organisms. Through a carefully orchestrated series of reactions, editosomes catalyze the insertion and deletion of uridine nucleotides, thereby rectifying frameshifts and restoring the coding potential of transcripts. The meticulous study of editosome activity has revealed a compelling interplay with various small molecules, offering a glimpse into potential therapeutic avenues. Notably, the disruption of editosome function presents a promising target for the development of novel treatments against Chagas disease, a condition caused by the kinetoplastid Trypanosoma cruzi. Continued research into the regulation and modulation of editosomes will not only deepen our understanding of RNA editing but could also pave the way for innovative strategies to confront kinetoplastid-induced ailments.
