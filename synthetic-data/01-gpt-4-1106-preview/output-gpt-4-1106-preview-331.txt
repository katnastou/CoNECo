prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: YdcSTUV ABC transporter. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we investigated the role of the YdcSTUV ABC transporter in antibiotic resistance among Escherichia coli strains isolated from clinical samples. Our analyses focused on determining the efficacy of this protein complex in the efflux of a broad spectrum of antibiotics, including beta-lactams, tetracyclines, and aminoglycosides. Samples were cultured under selective pressure with increasing concentrations of these antibiotics to assess the potential upregulation of the YdcSTUV ABC transporter. Fluorescently tagged substrates were employed to monitor the activity of the protein complex in real-time, revealing a significant correlation between its expression and the survival rate of bacterial cells in the presence of the antibiotics. Furthermore, inhibition assays utilizing small molecules showed a marked decrease in the efflux function, establishing a direct role for the YdcSTUV ABC transporter in the multidrug resistance phenotype observed. These findings offer insights into the mechanisms by which E. coli evade the antimicrobial effects of current therapeutic agents and lay the groundwork for the development of novel inhibitors that can sensitize resistant strains to existing treatments.
