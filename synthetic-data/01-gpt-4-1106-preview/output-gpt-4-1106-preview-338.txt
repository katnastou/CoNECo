prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: outer dynein arm. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: Recent studies have elucidated the critical role of the outer dynein arm in flagellar motility and ciliary function across a variety of eukaryotic cells. The integrity of this protein complex is paramount for the proper locomotion of single-celled organisms as well as the transport of fluids and particles along epithelial cell surfaces in multicellular organisms. Disruption in the assembly or function of the outer dynein arm has been implicated in a spectrum of respiratory illnesses and is a distinctive feature of primary ciliary dyskinesia, a congenital disorder characterized by chronic respiratory tract infections and reduced mucociliary clearance. In a recent controlled experiment involving murine models, disruptions in this protein complex correlated with aberrant respiratory epithelium ciliary beat frequency, suggesting a direct mechanism through which respiratory function is compromised. Furthermore, pharmacological trials targeting the stability and assembly efficacy of the outer dynein arm have shown promise in ameliorating some of the associated symptoms, leading to an increase in research interest around potential therapeutic interventions. Understanding the structural and functional nuances of the outer dynein arm will likely yield significant insights into the pathophysiology of ciliary disorders and open new pathways for targeted drug development.
