prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: H2ase 1. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we aimed to ascertain the role of H2ase 1 in cellular metabolism and its potential implications in the pathogenesis of metabolic disorders. Cultured murine hepatocytes were utilized as a model system to observe the effects of H2ase 1 inhibition on glucose uptake and lipid accumulation. Initial observations revealed that inhibition of H2ase 1 led to a marked decrease in glucose absorption, as demonstrated by a reduction in the uptake of fluorescently-labeled deoxyglucose analogs. Furthermore, lipid droplet staining indicated a substantial decrease in triglyceride storage within the hepatocytes, suggesting that H2ase 1 contributes significantly to lipid homeostasis. Subsequently, the hepatocytes with suppressed H2ase 1 activity demonstrated an increased sensitivity to oxidative stress, as evidenced by elevated reactive oxygen species levels upon exposure to a sub-lethal dose of hydrogen peroxide. This sensitivity could be indicative of a compromised antioxidative response, which is often a characteristic of metabolic syndrome and related pathologies. These findings prompt further investigation into H2ase 1 as a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of metabolic diseases, highlighting the significance of protein complexes in metabolic regulation and disease manifestation.
