prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: protein phosphatase 2. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: Recent advances in our comprehension of signal transduction pathways underscore the pivotal role of protein phosphatase 2 in mediating cellular processes fundamental to cancer progression. Protein phosphatase 2, a serine/threonine-specific phosphatase, has emerged as a crucial modulator of cell growth and division through its ability to dephosphorylate a multitude of substrates. In an effort to elucidate the mechanisms by which this enzyme contributes to oncogenesis, a series of assays were conducted to assess its activity in various cell lines derived from colorectal carcinoma. The assays quantitatively measured the catalytic action of protein phosphatase 2 in response to pharmacological inhibitors and compared it to the basal enzyme activity levels observed in normal epithelial cells. Moreover, insights into enzyme kinetics were obtained by monitoring the dephosphorylation rates of synthetic peptides designed to mimic endogenous targets. The results suggest a dysregulation of protein phosphatase 2 activity in malignant cells, implying its potential as a therapeutic target. The specificity of protein phosphatase 2 towards its substrates was further analyzed in the presence of modulatory agents such as cAMP, which is known to influence the cellular signaling landscape significantly. Understanding the functional dynamics of protein phosphatase 2 within the intricate network of cellular phosphorylation thus holds promise for the development of novel anti-cancer strategies.
