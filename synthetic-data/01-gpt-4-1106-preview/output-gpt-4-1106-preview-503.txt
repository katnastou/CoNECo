prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: ESCRT-0. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: Recent advancements in understanding intracellular trafficking have elucidated the critical role of the Endosomal Sorting Complex Required for Transport, specifically ESCRT-0, in the degradation pathway of ubiquitinated proteins. ESCRT-0 orchestrates the initial recognition and sequestration of these proteins into the endosomal membrane for subsequent sorting and transportation. In this study, we employed Saccharomyces cerevisiae as a model organism to explore the dynamics of ESCRT-0 within the multivesicular body (MVB) pathway. Using live-cell imaging coupled with fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) techniques, we observed that perturbations in lipid membrane composition, particularly the levels of phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate, significantly disrupted the recruitment of ESCRT-0 to endosomal membranes. Moreover, deficiency in ESCRT-0 functionality led to an accumulation of ubiquitinated proteins, suggesting a breakdown in the proteostatic mechanisms. This accumulation correlated with increased cellular susceptibility to proteotoxic stress, indicating a potential link between ESCRT-0 activity and the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease. These findings underscore the paramount importance of ESCRT-0 in maintaining cellular homeostasis and offer intriguing perspectives for therapeutic interventions targeting the early stages of protein sorting in degenerative diseases.
