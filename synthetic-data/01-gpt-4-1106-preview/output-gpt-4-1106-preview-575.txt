prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: SUN-KASH. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The recent studies exploring the SUN-KASH protein complex have shed light on its pivotal role within the mechanotransduction pathways of eukaryotic cells. This investigation aimed to elucidate the functional dynamics of SUN-KASH within the context of cellular responses to mechanical stress. Using a combination of fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) microscopy and co-immunoprecipitation, we assessed the interaction fidelity of the SUN-KASH protein complex in human fibroblasts subjected to cyclic tensile strain. Our findings suggest that the integrity of SUN-KASH is crucial for the propagation of force-induced signals from the extracellular matrix (ECM) through the cytoskeleton, ultimately leading to the nuclear envelope. Perturbation of the SUN-KASH protein complex resulted in altered nuclear morphology and a compromised mechanoresponsive gene expression profile, indicating its integral role in cellular homeostasis. Intriguingly, in pathological states such as muscular dystrophies, where mechanical transduction is impaired, the disruption of the SUN-KASH complex's function was found to correlate with disease severity. These insights into SUN-KASH mechanics could pave the way for novel therapeutic strategies aimed at restoring cellular function in mechanically-related diseases.
