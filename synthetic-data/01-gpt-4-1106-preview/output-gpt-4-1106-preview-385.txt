prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: RSR. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In recent investigations into the molecular mechanisms underlying DNA repair processes, considerable attention has been focused on the protein complex RSR and its role in homologous recombination. The present study sought to elucidate the specific contributions of RSR to the maintenance of genome stability in eukaryotic cells. Through a series of in vitro assays coupled with high-resolution microscopy, we observed that RSR consistently localized to sites of DNA damage induced by exposure to ionizing radiation in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Moreover, chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing (ChIP-seq) revealed an enriched binding of RSR to regions characterized by DNA double-strand breaks. In cell-cycle progression assays, cells deficient in functional RSR displayed a markedly increased sensitivity to genotoxic agents, such as mitomycin C and hydroxyurea, indicative of an impaired DNA damage response. These findings suggest that RSR plays a pivotal role in facilitating the repair of double-stranded DNA lesions, thereby safeguarding against mutagenesis and potential oncogenesis. Given the evolutionary conservation of DNA repair pathways, the implications of this research may extend to understanding the molecular underpinnings of cancer development in more complex organisms, including humans.
