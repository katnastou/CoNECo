prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: RDRC. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The recent elucidation of RDRC functionality has provided novel insights into the intricate mechanisms of RNA-directed DNA methylation. In our study, we explored the interaction between RDRC and key cellular metabolites in a murine model, aiming to delineate the complex's role in the context of epigenetic modifications. Intriguingly, RDRC activity was found to be modulated by the availability of S-adenosylmethionine (SAM), suggesting a potential feedback mechanism through which methylation patterns may influence RNA-mediated regulatory processes. Furthermore, RDRC appeared to exhibit increased stability in the presence of reduced levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS), highlighting a possible link between oxidative stress and epigenetic regulation. As oxidative stress is known to play a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases, further investigation into RDRC might provide a new window into understanding the molecular underpinnings of such conditions. The study encapsulates the complex's involvement in epigenetic regulation, with a special focus on its potential implications for disease progression, heralding a new era of therapeutic interventions targeting RDRC-mediated pathways.
