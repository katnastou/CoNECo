prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: IgD immunoglobulins. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In recent years, the exploration of the human immune response has increasingly highlighted the multifaceted role played by IgD immunoglobulins in immunological mechanisms. A deeper understanding of this protein complex has revealed its significant function within the mucosal immune system, where it serves to mobilize various immune effector cells in response to pathogen invasion. Notably, research has demonstrated that IgD immunoglobulins interact with respiratory tract microbes, contributing to a defensive barrier that is crucial for maintaining homeostasis. The current study sought to elucidate the specific pathways through which IgD immunoglobulins modulate inflammatory responses during asthmatic episodes. Patients with asthma were observed to have an altered profile of IgD immunoglobulin expression, suggesting a potential correlation between IgD levels and disease severity. Furthermore, in vitro experimentation with epithelial cells revealed that upon exposure to common allergens, there was a marked upregulation of IgD immunoglobulin production, which in turn, engaged basophils and mast cells, leading to the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines. These findings provide compelling evidence that IgD immunoglobulins may play a key role in the exacerbation of asthma symptoms and could serve as a potential biomarker for disease progression. Therapeutic strategies targeting this protein complex might offer a novel approach to the treatment of respiratory diseases characterized by chronic inflammation.
