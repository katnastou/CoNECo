prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: BBSomes. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we sought to elucidate the role of BBSomes in intracellular transport processes critical for maintaining cellular homeostasis. BBSomes, which are evolutionarily conserved multi-protein complexes, have been previously implicated in the regulation of ciliary membrane composition, a feature of particular importance when considering the pathophysiology of ciliopathies. Utilizing both in vitro and in vivo models, including murine cells and Caenorhabditis elegans, we conducted a series of experiments to investigate the impact of BBSomes on the trafficking of membrane-bound organelles and signaling molecules. Notably, our observations suggest that the disruption of BBSome function perturbs the dynamic equilibrium of lipid bilayers, significantly altering the localization and turnover of receptors involved in growth factor signaling pathways. Indeed, these perturbations were shown to contribute to aberrations in cell signaling cascades, leading to phenotypic manifestations reminiscent of Bardet-Biedl syndrome, a disorder that is closely associated with defective BBSome activity. These findings underscore the critical role of BBSomes in maintaining the cellular architecture and signaling environment necessary for proper cellular function, potentially offering novel therapeutic targets for intervention in related disease states.
