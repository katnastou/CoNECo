prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: mitochondrial cytochrome bc(1). Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In the recent study conducted by our laboratory, we aimed to elucidate the role of the mitochondrial cytochrome bc(1) in the context of cellular respiration and its implications on metabolic disorders. The research employed a cohort of rodent models subjected to a high-fat diet to investigate the direct consequences of lipid-induced oxidative stress on the function of the mitochondrial cytochrome bc(1). Over a period of eight weeks, metabolic parameters, such as glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity, were rigorously assessed in conjunction with mitochondrial respiration assays. Our observations revealed that animals exhibiting reduced activity of the mitochondrial cytochrome bc(1) complex displayed signs of compromised oxidative phosphorylation, leading to a significant decrease in ATP production. This bioenergetic deficit was accompanied by the onset of symptoms reminiscent of human metabolic syndrome, including elevated plasma triglyceride levels, hypertension, and hepatic steatosis. Furthermore, the electron microscopy analysis of the mitochondrial membranes provided insights into structural alterations that may underpin the functional derangements observed. Collectively, these findings suggest that the mitochondrial cytochrome bc(1) plays a critical role in maintaining metabolic homeostasis, and its dysfunction may contribute to the pathogenesis of a spectrum of metabolic diseases. The implications of this work underscore the potential therapeutic value in targeting the mitochondrial cytochrome bc(1) for the management and treatment of metabolic disorders.
