prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: invertasome. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In the recent exploration of carbohydrate metabolism pathways, the protein complex known as the invertasome has become the focal point of novel therapeutic discussions targeting metabolic syndromes. This intricate multi-protein assembly has been demonstrated to orchestrate the hydrolysis of sucrose into fructose and glucose. Subsequently, during glycolysis, these monosaccharides serve as pivotal substrates, fueling cellular energy production within various tissues of Homo sapiens. Accumulated evidence from biochemical assays and enzymatic kinetics suggests that the invertasome may exhibit an allosteric regulation mechanism, responding sensitively to fluctuations in intracellular levels of key metabolites, such as ATP and NADH. In pathophysiological states, particularly in diabetic patients, altered activity of the invertasome has been linked to imbalances in blood sugar homeostasis, which contribute significantly to the progression of the disease. The discovery of small-molecule inhibitors, which display high affinity and specificity towards the invertasome, has steered research towards innovative pharmacological strategies aiming to modulate its activity. Consequently, these findings could pave a promising pathway for the development of new treatments that effectively ameliorate the complications associated with disorders of glucose metabolism.
