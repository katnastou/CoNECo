prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: IgG3. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: Recent studies have focused on elucidating the role of IgG3 in the adaptive immune response, particularly its efficacy in neutralizing viral pathogens. The unique structural characteristics of IgG3, encompassing an extended hinge region, confer a higher degree of flexibility compared to other subclasses, which may facilitate cross-linking of antigens and enhance the opsonization process. In murine models, the administration of purified IgG3 has shown a marked increase in the clearance of pathogens such as Streptococcus pneumoniae. Furthermore, epidemiological data suggest that individuals with higher serum levels of IgG3 exhibit a lower incidence of influenza, indicating a possible protective role. Notably, the complement activation triggered by IgG3 has also been implicated in enhancing phagocytosis, suggesting that therapeutic strategies leveraging IgG3 could prove beneficial in diseases characterized by impaired pathogen clearance. Current research is focusing on the molecular mechanisms underlying the interaction between IgG3 and Fc gamma receptors, with the aim of developing targeted treatments for immunocompromised patients. Despite promising findings, a comprehensive understanding of the IgG3 pathways and their manipulation remains a challenge for the field of immunotherapy.
