prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: galectin-2. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In a recent investigation into the immunomodulatory roles of lectins in inflammatory processes, attention has been centered on the protein complex galectin-2. This study aimed to delineate the mechanistic pathways through which galectin-2 influences cytokine secretion in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). Utilizing both in vitro and ex vivo assays, we examined the binding affinity of galectin-2 to specific glycosylated surface receptors under varying inflammatory conditions, mimicked by the induction of stress using lipopolysaccharide (LPS) treatment. Subsequent enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) revealed a dose-dependent reduction in the levels of interleukin-6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-Î±) upon galectin-2 application, suggesting an inhibitory effect. This suppression of pro-inflammatory cytokines points to a potential therapeutic application for galectin-2 in the management of autoimmune disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis. Moreover, the involvement of galectin-2 in modulating the activity of transcription factors and its downstream effect on the inflammatory cascade warrants further elucidation to unravel its full biological significance in the context of chronic inflammation.
