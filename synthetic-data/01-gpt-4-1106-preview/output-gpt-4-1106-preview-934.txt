prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: membrane-bound IgD. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this investigation, we aim to elucidate the functional significance of membrane-bound IgD in the context of immune response modulation. Membrane-bound IgD is predominantly expressed on the surface of mature B cells and is integral to the initiation of antigen-specific immunity. Various lymphoid tissues were harvested from adult mice, and flow cytometry was employed to quantify the expression levels of membrane-bound IgD in conjunction with surface markers indicative of B cell activation. Following antigen exposure, there was a significant upregulation in the expression of membrane-bound IgD, which was observed in parallel with an increase in cytokine production, emphasizing its potential role in the B cell activation cascade. Intriguingly, upon challenge with a bacterial pathogen, the experimental group with enhanced expression of membrane-bound IgD demonstrated a markedly improved clearance of the infection, suggesting a pivotal involvement in host defense mechanisms. Further investigations are warranted to unravel the molecular pathways mediated by membrane-bound IgD that augment the immune response, which could potentially lead to novel therapeutic interventions for immune-related diseases.
