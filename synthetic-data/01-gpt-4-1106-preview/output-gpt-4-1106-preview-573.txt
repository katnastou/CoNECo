prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: box H/ACA RNP. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In a recent study published in the Journal of Molecular Biology, researchers have elucidated the functional characteristics of the box H/ACA RNP within the nucleolar compartment of eukaryotic cells. The box H/ACA RNP is critical in the biogenesis of ribosomes, specifically mediating the pseudouridylation of pre-ribosomal RNA, a modification essential for proper ribosomal function and protein synthesis. Utilizing CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing to create knockouts of non-core components associated with the assembly of the box H/ACA RNP, the study revealed that disruptions in the complex's integrity led to notable phenotypic consequences. Most significantly, cell lines deficient in the assembly or function of the box H/ACA RNP exhibited reduced proliferation rates and an increased propensity to enter apoptosis. Observations also implicated the complex in the cellular response to oxidative stress, as elevated reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels were detected in modified cell lines. This suggests a potential linkage between the box H/ACA RNP and the cellular oxidative stress response mechanism, potentially offering a novel insight into the pathophysiology of oxidative-stress related diseases. The comprehensive analysis of the box H/ACA RNP carried out in this research paves the way for future investigations into targeted therapies that may mitigate the detrimental effects associated with its dysfunction.
