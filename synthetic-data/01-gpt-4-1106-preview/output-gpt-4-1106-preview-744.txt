prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: FIIa. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In the current study, we explored the interaction of FIIa with various anticoagulant substrates to assess its role in thrombotic pathways. Our in vivo experiments utilized murine models exhibiting symptoms of thrombosis, where administration of specific inhibitors of FIIa resulted in a significant reduction in clot formation, indicating its pivotal role in the coagulation cascade. To further understand the mechanisms of action, in vitro kinetic assays were conducted using purified FIIa in the presence of different concentrations of antithrombin III, revealing a dosage-dependent inhibition curve. Importantly, when evaluating potential side effects, hematology panels demonstrated no significant alterations in erythrocyte integrity or platelet counts, suggesting a targeted effect of the inhibitors on FIIa functionality without inducing hematological imbalances. Additionally, histological analysis of hepatic tissue post-treatment displayed no signs of inflammation or necrosis, affirming the therapeutic window's safety for potential clinical application. Overall, our findings underscore FIIa as a promising target for novel anticoagulant therapies in the prevention and treatment of thrombotic events, with potential implications for patients suffering from conditions such as deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism.
