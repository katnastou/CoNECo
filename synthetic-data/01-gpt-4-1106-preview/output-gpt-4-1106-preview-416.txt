prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: laminin. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The extracellular matrix (ECM) plays a crucial role in various cellular processes including differentiation, migration, and adhesion. A series of in vitro assays revealed that laminin is integral to the composition and function of the ECM, particularly within the context of neural tissue regeneration. Recent investigations into spinal cord injury models in murine subjects have elucidated that exogenous supplementation of laminin can significantly enhance axonal growth, supporting a neuroregenerative environment. The interaction between laminin and cellular receptors was shown to mediate signal transduction pathways that promote cellular survival, which could be instrumental in the development of therapeutic strategies for neurodegenerative diseases such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and multiple sclerosis. Additionally, the presence of laminin in the vascular basement membrane was found to be crucial for endothelial cell integrity, suggesting its potential role in angiogenesis and as a target in cancer metastasis inhibition. Pharmacokinetic studies demonstrated that systemically administered compounds designed to increase laminin stability within the ECM could have far-reaching implications for both tissue engineering and the development of anti-fibrotic therapies.
