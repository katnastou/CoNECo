prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: RDC. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In an effort to elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying cell cycle regulation, recent investigations have focused on the role of the RDC protein complex in apoptosis signaling pathways. In this context, the research team employed both in vitro and in vivo models to observe the interaction between RDC and various apoptotic stimuli. Initial experiments utilizing murine models revealed that exposure to reactive oxygen species resulted in an augmented expression of RDC in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, cell viability assays conducted on cultivated human fibroblasts established that the integrity of the RDC complex is critical for the execution of the apoptosis cascade triggered by cytochrome c release. Complementary chromatography-coupled mass spectrometry analyses delineated the post-translational modifications accruing on RDC in the presence of pro-apoptotic agents, suggesting a modulatory role of these modifications in the functional dynamics of the protein complex. The findings presented herein provide compelling evidence for the pivotal involvement of RDC in the cellular response to oxidative stress, which may open novel therapeutic avenues in the treatment of diseases characterized by dysregulated apoptosis, such as cancer and neurodegenerative disorders.
