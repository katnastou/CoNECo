prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: gammaTuSCs. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The dynamic organization of microtubules is critical for a range of cellular processes including mitosis, intracellular transport, and maintenance of cell shape. Recent advancements in our understanding of microtubule nucleation centers have underscored the significance of gammaTuSCs in microtubule organization within the cell. This protein complex serves as a pivotal template for microtubule polymerization, initiating the formation of these cytoskeletal elements from free tubulin dimers. Crucial experiments involving in vitro assays have revealed that the efficiency of microtubule nucleation by gammaTuSCs is markedly increased in the presence of GTP as compared to GDP, suggesting a nuanced allosteric regulation governed by nucleotide states. Additionally, in pathophysiological contexts, such as in cancer cells, alterations in the regulation of gammaTuSCs have been correlated with aberrant microtubule dynamics, which suggest that this complex could be a potential therapeutic target. The specificity of the interactions between gammaTuSCs and regulatory proteins opens new avenues for the development of drugs aimed at modulating microtubule formation, offering hope for innovative treatments for a range of diseases characterized by cytoskeletal dysregulation.
