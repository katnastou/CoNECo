prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: RFA. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The present study investigates the role of the RFA protein complex in DNA replication and repair mechanisms across multiple mammalian cell lines. Utilizing immunoprecipitation followed by mass spectrometry, we observed the presence of RFA in association with chromatin during the S phase, suggesting a pivotal function in replication fork progression. Moreover, chromatin immunofluorescence techniques revealed that RFA localization patterns were markedly altered in response to induction of DNA damage by ultraviolet irradiation, implying a direct involvement in the DNA damage response. To elucidate the consequence of RFA perturbation, cells were subjected to siRNA-mediated knockdown of the complex, resulting in heightened sensitivity to genotoxic stress and an increase in markers indicative of double-strand breaks, such as Î³-H2AX foci formation. Our findings underscore the essential nature of RFA in maintaining genomic stability and provide potential therapeutic insights for diseases characterized by impaired DNA repair mechanisms, including various cancers and inherited genetic disorders.
