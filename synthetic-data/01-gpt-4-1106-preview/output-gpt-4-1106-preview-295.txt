prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: SufA. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In a concerted effort to elucidate the mechanisms underlying the cellular response to oxidative stress, we examined the role of the protein complex SufA in the context of reactive oxygen species (ROS) management. Through a series of in vitro and in vivo experiments, we investigated the contribution of SufA to the maintenance of cellular homeostasis in Escherichia coli under various oxidative conditions. Our data reveal that SufA plays a pivotal role in the detoxification process by participating in the repair of iron-sulfur clusters, which are essential cofactors in numerous metabolic pathways. Exposure to hydrogen peroxide significantly disrupted the normal function of these clusters, yet overexpression of SufA resulted in a marked increase in cellular viability, suggesting a protective mechanism against the pernicious effects of ROS. Intriguingly, the protective capacity of SufA was substantially diminished in the presence of the iron-chelating agent 2,2'-bipyridine, indicating that iron bioavailability is crucial for SufA's activity. Notably, these findings have implications for understanding the pathological processes of oxidative stress-related diseases and may inform the development of novel therapeutic strategies targeting iron metabolism and antioxidant defense systems.
