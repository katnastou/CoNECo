prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: IFT-B. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In a recent study investigating the pathogenesis of ciliopathies, the dynamics of the protein complex IFT-B have been elucidated through a series of in vitro and in vivo experiments. Cilia, the hair-like organelles protruding from the surface of many cell types, play a pivotal role in diverse physiological processes, and their dysfunction is implicated in an array of human diseases. The IFT-B complex is essential for ciliogenesis, as it mediates anterograde intraflagellar transport, which is critical for the assembly and maintenance of ciliary structure. The present study employed a combination of cryo-electron microscopy and super-resolution fluorescence microscopy to visualize the IFT-B complex's interaction within the cilium of murine models. Utilizing pharmacological agents to modulate the cellular microtubule network, the research demonstrated that disruption of microtubule integrity leads to aberrant localization of IFT-B, underscoring its dependence on an intact cytoskeleton. Furthermore, comparative analyses in cells treated with inhibitors of specific signaling pathways pointed to potential regulatory mechanisms governing IFT-B-mediated transport. The findings provide new insights into the molecular underpinnings of ciliary dynamics and offer promising therapeutic targets for disorders arising from ciliary dysfunction.
