prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: interleukin-23 receptor. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The interleukin-23 receptor has recently garnered significant attention due to its role in the pathogenesis of several autoimmune diseases, including psoriasis and inflammatory bowel disease. The purpose of this study was to delineate the signaling pathway activated by the interleukin-23 receptor and its implications for immune response modulation. Cultured human T-helper cells were treated with various concentrations of the cytokine IL-23 and subsequent receptor engagement was quantified using flow cytometry. The results demonstrated a dose-dependent increase in receptor activity, which was paralleled by the upregulation of pro-inflammatory mediators and the proliferation of T-helper 17 cells. Furthermore, treatment with a monoclonal antibody specifically targeting the interleukin-23 receptor led to a notable reduction in the expression of these inflammatory agents. These findings suggest that the interleukin-23 receptor plays a pivotal role in the amplification of inflammatory pathways, and that therapeutic agents modulating this receptor may hold potential for the treatment of autoimmune disorders. Future in vivo studies using murine models of autoimmunity are required to further understand the therapeutic potential of interleukin-23 receptor inhibitors and to evaluate their safety and efficacy. The results of such studies will be critical in guiding the development of novel treatments aimed at modulating this receptor's activity to alleviate autoimmune disease symptoms.
