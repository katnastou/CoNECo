prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: NAC. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In the recent study published in the Journal of Cellular Biochemistry, we investigated the role of NAC in the regulation of proteostasis under conditions of oxidative stress. Our research revealed that upon exposure to reactive oxygen species (ROS), cell cultures exhibited an increased expression of NAC, which appeared to correlate with enhanced clearance of misfolded proteins. This enhanced clearance was hypothesized to result from the direct involvement of NAC in the facilitation of proper protein folding and prevention of aggregation. In addition, animal models subjected to oxidative environments showed a protective effect against cellular damage when NAC levels were experimentally elevated, suggesting a potential therapeutic role for modulating this complex in diseases characterized by oxidative stress, such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's. The study also profiled post-translational modifications of NAC following exposure to hydrogen peroxide, an ROS, providing insight into the complex's functional dynamics in a cellular context. Overall, our findings underscore the critical function of NAC in maintaining cellular homeostasis and highlight its importance as a target for interventions aimed at mitigating the deleterious effects of oxidative stress.
