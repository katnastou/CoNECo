prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: MICOS. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The mitochondrial contact site and cristae organizing system (MICOS) plays a crucial role in maintaining mitochondrial architecture and function. In this study, we sought to elucidate the impact of MICOS on cellular metabolism under conditions of oxidative stress. Human fibroblasts were subjected to hydrogen peroxide to induce oxidative damage and the subsequent response of MICOS was assessed. We observed that the disruption of MICOS integrity led to a significant perturbation in the electron transport chain, as evidenced by a reduction in oxygen consumption rate and an increase in the generation of reactive oxygen species. Interestingly, the impact on mitochondrial membrane potential was less pronounced, suggesting a specific role for MICOS in maintaining the efficiency of electron transport under stress conditions. Furthermore, we investigated the cross-talk between MICOS and mitochondrial dynamics, noting alterations in fusion and fission events that coincide with changes in MICOS behavior. The findings from this study provide insights into the importance of MICOS for cellular resilience against oxidative stress, proposing a potential target for therapeutic intervention in diseases characterized by mitochondrial dysfunction.
