prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: IL-3 receptor. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The present study focuses on the signaling pathways elicited upon the activation of the IL-3 receptor, a crucial modulator of hematopoietic cell survival and proliferation. While the exact mechanism of action has been extensively studied, the scope of our research aimed to delineate the role of the IL-3 receptor in the context of acute myeloid leukemia (AML). We conducted a series of in vitro assays using isolated leukocytes from murine models, subsequently characterizing the downstream effects of IL-3 receptor engagement. The assays revealed a marked increase in the cellular proliferation rates upon stimulation with IL-3, affirming the receptorâ€™s contribution to leukemic cell expansion. Furthermore, we examined the cytotoxic response of these cells to chemotherapeutic agents, aiming to ascertain whether the activation status of the IL-3 receptor correlates with the efficacy of treatment. Our results indicated that cells exhibiting higher IL-3 receptor activity were less susceptible to the apoptosis-inducing effects of the chemotherapeutics, suggesting a potential mechanism of drug resistance. This study underscores the significance of the IL-3 receptor in AML pathophysiology and its implications for therapeutic interventions.
