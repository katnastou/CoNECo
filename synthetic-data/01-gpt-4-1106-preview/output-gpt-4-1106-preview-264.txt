prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: GPI-GnT. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In a recent groundbreaking study, we investigated the role of GPI-GnT, a protein complex implicated in the post-translational modification of numerous cell surface proteins, in the context of cellular adhesion and pathogen susceptibility. Utilizing a combination of mass spectrometry and immunofluorescence techniques, we quantified the alterations in peptide signatures specific to the substrates of GPI-GnT in various human cell lines. The results revealed a significant decrease in the stability of cell surface protein anchors in cells deficient in GPI-GnT, highlighting the complex's essential role in maintaining cell membrane integrity. Moreover, in vivo assays conducted in a murine model demonstrated an increased susceptibility to Streptococcus pneumoniae infection when GPI-GnT activity was inhibited, suggesting that the complex may have a pivotal role in immune defense mechanisms. Our findings provide novel insights into the multifaceted functions of GPI-GnT and establish a foundation for further investigations into its therapeutic potential in treating diseases associated with cellular adhesion deficits and increased infection risk.
