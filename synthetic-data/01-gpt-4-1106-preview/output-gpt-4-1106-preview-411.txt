prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: Pol-zeta4. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In a recent study investigating the mechanisms underlying DNA repair, particular attention was given to the functional dynamics of the Pol-zeta4 complex. This multiprotein assembly has been implicated in the extension phase of translesion synthesis, a process critical for bypassing DNA lesions that would otherwise impede replication. Through a series of in vitro assays, researchers observed that the presence of Pol-zeta4 significantly reduced the accumulation of oxidative DNA damage markers, such as 8-oxoguanine, in cultured human fibroblasts when exposed to hydrogen peroxide, a known inducer of oxidative stress. Additionally, siRNA-mediated knockdown of Pol-zeta4 led to an increase in double-strand break markers, such as Î³-H2AX, suggesting that the complex plays a vital role in maintaining genomic stability. Experiments conducted in murine models corroborated these findings, as mice deficient in the complex presented with a phenotype consistent with premature aging, a hallmark of impaired DNA repair pathways. Taken together, these data reinforce the conception of Pol-zeta4 as a key player in the cellular response to genotoxic insults and postulate potential therapeutic targets for the treatment of diseases associated with DNA repair deficiencies, such as certain cancers and age-related disorders.
