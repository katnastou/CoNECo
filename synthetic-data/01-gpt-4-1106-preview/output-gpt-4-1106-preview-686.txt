prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: PBAF. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In the recent study published in the Journal of Cellular Biochemistry, the role of the PBAF complex in the regulation of chromatin remodeling has been highlighted as a pivotal factor influencing cellular differentiation and development. The research team conducted a series of experiments involving various cell lines, including human stem cells and differentiated neuronal cells, intending to elucidate the mechanisms by which PBAF modulates gene expression. Through chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing (ChIP-seq), the authors discovered that PBAF preferentially binds to promoter regions of genes involved in cell cycle regulation and DNA repair pathways. Moreover, the knockdown of PBAF via RNA interference resulted in the aberrant expression of these genes, hinting at its essential role in maintaining genomic stability. Furthermore, the team explored the impact of PBAF on the response to oxidative stress by treating cells with hydrogen peroxide and tracking the activation of stress-response genes. Their findings suggest that PBAF might serve as a molecular hub that coordinates the cellular response to environmental challenges, with potential implications for understanding the pathogenesis of diseases characterized by impaired chromatin dynamics, such as cancer and certain neurodegenerative disorders.
