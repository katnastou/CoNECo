prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: IL-23. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The immune response in mammalian systems has been extensively studied with particular emphasis on the cytokine milieu and its role in inflammatory processes. IL-23, a pivotal protein complex in the regulation of the immune system, has garnered significant attention due to its implication in autoimmune diseases such as psoriasis and inflammatory bowel disease. Recent research has elucidated that the presence of IL-23 in the cytokine cascade is critical for the differentiation and maintenance of Th17 cells, a subset of T helper cells known for their involvement in inflammation and host defense. This protein complex operates within a unique niche, distinct from that of other cytokines, modulating immune responses through the activation of its receptor, resulting in the upregulation of effector cytokines such as IL-17. Therapeutic strategies that aim to neutralize IL-23 have shown promise in ameliorating symptoms and altering the course of autoimmune pathologies. Furthermore, efforts to map the interactions between IL-23 and other components of the immune system have provided insights into the intricate network of cell signaling that underlies complex immune responses. Advances in understanding the structure-function relationship of IL-23 have been pivotal in designing targeted interventions, thus contributing significantly to the field of biomedicine and offering new hope for patients with chronic inflammatory conditions.
