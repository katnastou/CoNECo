prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: alphav-beta1 integrin. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: Recent studies have elucidated the pivotal role of the alphav-beta1 integrin in the regulation of angiogenesis within malignant tissues. In our current investigation, we sought to determine the precise mechanisms through which this protein complex contributes to the vascularization process in glioblastoma models. Utilizing in vitro endothelial cell assays, we observed that inhibition of alphav-beta1 integrin function resulted in a marked decrease in cell adhesion and migration, key steps in the formation of blood vessels. Moreover, in vivo analyses in murine models revealed that targeted knockdown of alphav-beta1 integrin expression significantly impaired tumor growth and vascularity. These findings were underpinned by mass spectrometry data, which highlighted a downstream reduction in VEGF signaling pathways, concomitant with the disruption of alphav-beta1 integrin activity. Collectively, these results suggest that the alphav-beta1 integrin serves as an essential node in the molecular network governing angiogenic processes within the tumor microenvironment, and they underscore the therapeutic potential of agents that target this particular protein complex in the treatment of glioblastoma and other vascular-dependent pathologies.
