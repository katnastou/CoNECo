prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: MetNIQ. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In an effort to elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying cellular homeostasis, a recent study focused on the characterization of the novel protein complex known as MetNIQ. This research uncovered that MetNIQ was intricately involved in the regulation of metabolic processes within Escherichia coli, specifically playing a pivotal role in response to nitrogen limitation. Isotopic labeling experiments coupled with mass spectrometry revealed that MetNIQ modulates the intracellular concentrations of key metabolites, such as glutamine and methionine, suggesting a feedback loop essential for nitrogen economy under nutrient-scarce conditions. Knockout mice deficient in the human homolog of MetNIQ exhibited signs of metabolic stress, including elevated blood ammonia levels and decreased urea cycle efficiency, implying potential relevance of MetNIQ in hepatic encephalopathy. Moreover, transcriptomic analysis showed significant alterations in the expression of stress-response genes in cells lacking MetNIQ, highlighting the complex's influence on the broader metabolic network. These findings provide a foundation for further investigations into the therapeutic potential of targeting MetNIQ in metabolic disorders, as well as the exploration of its regulatory functions in other organisms.
