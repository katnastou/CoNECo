prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: NDH-I. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: Recent advancements in the understanding of mitochondrial dysfunctions have underscored the pivotal role of NDH-I in the etiology of various metabolic disorders. NDH-I, a key enzyme complex in the mitochondrial respiratory chain, is instrumental in the process of oxidative phosphorylation, where it catalyzes the initial step of electron transfer to the ubiquinone pool. The significance of NDH-I was elucidated through a series of in vitro experiments using isolated mitochondria from murine models, where its activity was shown to be compromised in the presence of high concentrations of reactive oxygen species (ROS). This relationship suggests a potential link between oxidative stress and the impairment of NDH-I, which could result in a diminished capacity for ATP generation. As such, the dysfunction of NDH-I has been implicated in the pathophysiology of neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's and Alzheimer's, where mitochondrial deficits are known to contribute to disease progression. Further investigation is warranted to develop therapeutic interventions aimed at stabilizing NDH-I activity, which may offer a novel avenue for the management of metabolic and neurodegenerative disorders.
