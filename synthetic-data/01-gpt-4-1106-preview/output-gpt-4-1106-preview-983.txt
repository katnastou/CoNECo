prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: SAE. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In an effort to elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying neurodegenerative disorders, recent studies have focused on the post-translational modification of proteins mediated by ubiquitin-like molecules. Central to these modifications is the SAE protein complex, which catalyzes the initial step in the sumoylation pathway â€“ a critical process implicated in the regulation of protein function and localization. Dysregulation of sumoylation has been observed in an array of pathological conditions, including Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease. Our current research utilized both in vitro and in vivo models, exposing neuronal cultures and Caenorhabditis elegans to oxidative stress conditions known to induce protein misfolding. The investigation revealed that upregulation of the SAE complex results in enhanced resistance to proteotoxic stress, suggesting a potential neuroprotective role. These findings shed light on the SAE complex as a conceivable therapeutic target that, if modulated, may ameliorate the cellular pathologies associated with neurodegenerative diseases, thereby improving neuronal survival and function. Future work is required to define the precise substrates of SAE in neurons and to understand how its activity is regulated in response to neural health and disease states.
