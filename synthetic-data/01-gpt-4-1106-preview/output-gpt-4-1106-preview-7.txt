prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: elongator holoenzyme. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In the quest to elucidate the molecular mechanisms underpinning cellular homeostasis, the elongator holoenzyme has garnered considerable attention due to its multifaceted roles in transcriptional elongation, histone acetylation, and cytoplasmic tRNA modification. Recently, investigations have explored the implication of the elongator holoenzyme in the pathophysiology of neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimerâ€™s disease. In vitro studies conducted using mammalian neuronal cultures have demonstrated that dysregulation of the elongator holoenzyme leads to compromised neurite outgrowth and synaptic plasticity, which are hallmarks of neuronal dysfunction. Furthermore, small molecule modulators have been identified that enhance the activity of the elongator holoenzyme, thereby ameliorating the deleterious effects observed in the presence of amyloid-beta peptides. Such modulators could potentially pave the way for novel therapeutic strategies aimed at counteracting the progressive loss of neuronal connectivity and function witnessed in patients with neurodegenerative conditions. Meanwhile, the exact molecular mechanisms through which the elongator holoenzyme modifies the neuronal landscape remain an active area of investigation, with recent transcriptomic analyses revealing a subset of genes whose expression patterns are altered in conjunction with the enzymatic activity shifts of this complex.
