prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: inhibin beta-B. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In the current study, we explored the therapeutic potential of targeting inhibin beta-B in the progression of ovarian cancer. The expression levels of inhibin beta-B were quantitatively assessed using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and Western blot analysis in both normal ovarian tissue and ovarian cancer biopsies obtained from a cohort of patients. Our findings revealed a significant upregulation of inhibin beta-B in the malignant tissues compared to their benign counterparts. Furthermore, in vitro experiments utilizing ovarian cancer cell lines treated with a specific inhibitor of inhibin beta-B resulted in reduced cell proliferation, increased apoptosis, and diminished migratory capabilities. These effects suggest a role for inhibin beta-B in tumor growth and metastasis, making it a potential biomarker for disease severity and a promising target for pharmacological intervention. Subsequent in vivo studies in a murine xenograft model confirmed the inhibitory effects on tumor growth, providing a preclinical rationale for the development of inhibitors that could modulate the activity of inhibin beta-B as part of a targeted therapy approach in ovarian cancer treatment. The toxicological profile of such inhibitors remains to be assessed, but the present data supports the hypothesis that inhibin beta-B has a critical role in ovarian cancer pathophysiology and therefore represents a novel target for therapeutic exploration.
