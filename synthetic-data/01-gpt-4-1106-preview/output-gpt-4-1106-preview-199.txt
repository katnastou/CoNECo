prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: fhuCDB. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we focus on delineating the functional attributes of the fhuCDB protein complex within Escherichia coli, and its role in the uptake and transport of iron, a crucial micronutrient required for an array of cellular processes. Iron is typically sequestered within the extracellular environment in the form of ferric iron complexes, thus necessitating sophisticated mechanisms for acquisition. The fhuCDB complex functions as part of a siderophore-dependent pathway, engaging specifically with hydroxamate-type siderophores that chelate and shuttle ferric ions across the bacterial outer membrane. Upon binding its ligand, a conformational change in the fhuCDB structure is hypothesized to facilitate the transfer of iron into the periplasmic space, a process believed to be ATP-dependent. This research aims to elucidate the kinetic parameters of fhuCDB-mediated transport, assess its specificity and efficiency under varying iron-concentration conditions, and explore its potential as a target for antimicrobial interventions. Given the escalating issue of antibiotic resistance, understanding the fhuCDB complex not only provides insight into fundamental bacterial physiology but also holds promise for the development of novel therapeutic strategies to combat infectious diseases.
