prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: NPC. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In the recent study published in the International Journal of Molecular Sciences, the functional dynamics of the NPC in relation to its regulatory role in cellular transport has been elucidated with unprecedented clarity. The research employed cutting-edge cryo-electron microscopy to visualize the complex in various states of cargo translocation. Upon analysis, it was observed that specific chemical modulators could alter the conformation of the NPC, suggesting a potential pathway for the therapeutic targeting of diseases characterized by defective nucleocytoplasmic transport. In particular, the investigation highlighted the impact of ATP molecules on the kinetic mechanisms governing the complex's operations. In in vivo experiments using Mus musculus models, pathological specimens exhibited compromised NPC functionality, which consistently correlated with the phenotypic progression of neurodegenerative disorders. These findings underscore the significance of the NPC in maintaining cellular homeostasis and provide a foundation for the development of interventions aimed at rectifying its dysfunction in disease contexts.
