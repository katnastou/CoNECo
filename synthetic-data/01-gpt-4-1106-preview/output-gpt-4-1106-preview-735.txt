prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: LinE. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In the recent investigation, the biological function of the LinE protein complex was elucidated through a series of in vitro and in vivo assays. The study primarily focused on determining the role of LinE in cellular signaling pathways associated with neoplastic transformation. Using a murine model, it was demonstrated that the knockout of the complex correlates with a marked reduction in the incidence of chemically induced tumors. Subsequent biochemical analyses revealed that LinE interacts with key regulators of apoptosis, suggesting a potential mechanism for its involvement in tumorigenesis. Furthermore, mass spectrometry analysis identified post-translational modifications that could modulate the activity of LinE, including phosphorylation and ubiquitination. The data collectively indicate that LinE may serve as a critical modulator in the signaling networks that govern cell proliferation and survival, underpinning its relevance as a potential target for therapeutic intervention in cancer treatment. Notably, these findings contribute to a growing body of evidence highlighting the importance of protein complex dysregulation in the pathogenesis of various diseases.
