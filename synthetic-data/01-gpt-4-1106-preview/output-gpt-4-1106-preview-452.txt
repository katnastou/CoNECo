prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: mammalian spliceosomal complex E. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The mammalian spliceosomal complex E plays a crucial role in the pre-mRNA splicing process, which is essential for the maturation of mRNA prior to translation. Recent studies have elucidated the complex dynamics of this macromolecular assembly within the nucleus of eukaryotic cells, highlighting its significance in the accurate removal of intronic sequences. Dysregulation of splicing fidelity, stemming from aberrant function of the mammalian spliceosomal complex E, has been implicated in a diverse range of pathological conditions, including certain cancers and neurodegenerative diseases. Investigations utilizing CRISPR-Cas9 mediated gene editing in Mus musculus models have provided valuable insights into the physiological consequences of perturbations in complex activity. Additionally, advanced imaging techniques such as cryo-electron microscopy have been instrumental in mapping the intricate architecture of this spliceosomal assembly, revealing potential therapeutic targets. In light of these findings, the exploration of small molecule modulators that can influence the function of the mammalian spliceosomal complex E is a promising avenue for the development of novel pharmacological interventions. These could potentially ameliorate splicing-related pathologies by restoring or modulating the activity of this essential protein complex.
