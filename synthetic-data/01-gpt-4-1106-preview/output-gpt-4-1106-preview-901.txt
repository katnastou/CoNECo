prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: interleukin-35. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: Interleukin-35 (IL-35) has emerged as a pivotal immunoregulatory cytokine, exerting significant influence over the intricate proceedings of immune responses. Recent investigations have elucidated the role of IL-35 in regulatory T-cell (Treg) function, where it contributes to the maintenance of immune homeostasis and the amelioration of inflammatory conditions. In a murine model of autoimmune disease, administration of recombinant IL-35 was correlated with a decline in disease severity, suggesting its therapeutic potential. Moreover, IL-35 levels have been measured across a spectrum of human disorders, revealing an inverse relationship with disease activity in patients suffering from rheumatoid arthritis. This cytokine's involvement in signaling pathways is of profound interest, as it may unlock novel strategies aimed at modulating immune dysregulation. Consequently, IL-35 presents a promising target for the development of biotherapeutics directed toward the treatment of autoimmune diseases, and its study could pave the way for groundbreaking advancements in immunotherapy.
