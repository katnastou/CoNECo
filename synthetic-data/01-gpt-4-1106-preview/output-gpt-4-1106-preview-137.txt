prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: channel-forming toxin. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we investigated the molecular mechanisms underlying the disruption of cellular homeostasis by the channel-forming toxin. Notably, this toxin has been implicated in the pathogenesis of various bacterial infections, where it exerts its detrimental effects by perturbing the phospholipid bilayer of host cells. To elucidate the interaction between the channel-forming toxin and the cellular membrane, we conducted a series of in vitro experiments using liposome models. The toxinâ€™s affinity for particular phospholipid headgroups was quantified using a fluorescence-based assay, revealing a marked preference for membranes rich in phosphatidylcholine. Further biophysical analyses, including surface plasmon resonance and circular dichroism spectroscopy, provided insight into the conformational changes that the toxin undergoes upon membrane insertion. The electrophysiological properties of the channel-forming toxin were characterized using patch-clamp recordings, which demonstrated its capacity to alter the ionic permeability of the cellular membrane. These findings contribute to our understanding of the toxin's role in disease pathogenesis and could aid in the development of novel therapeutics aimed at mitigating the effects of this potent virulence factor.
