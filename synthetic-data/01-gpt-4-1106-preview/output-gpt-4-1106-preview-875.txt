prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: mtEXO. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In a recent study focused on elucidating the mechanisms of mitochondrial maintenance, the involvement of the protein complex mtEXO has garnered significant attention. This protein complex has been shown to play a critical role in the regulation of mitochondrial RNA processing, an essential function given the organelle's reliance on efficient transcription and translation systems for its plethora of metabolic activities. Dysregulation of mtEXO has been implicated in a spectrum of mitochondrial pathologies, suggesting a pivotal role in mitochondrial homeostasis. In this study, we utilized a variety of model organisms, including *Saccharomyces cerevisiae* and *Mus musculus*, to investigate the downstream effects of mtEXO perturbation. Our results point to a distinct pattern of metabolic disruption, characterized by altered oxidative phosphorylation and reduced cellular respiration rates. Furthermore, this disruption has been correlated with an increased production of reactive oxygen species, highlighting a potential mechanism by which mtEXO dysfunction could contribute to the pathology of mitochondrial diseases. This research not only advances our understanding of mtEXO's role but also opens new avenues for therapeutic interventions aimed at ameliorating mitochondrial dysfunction-related diseases.
