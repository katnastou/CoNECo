prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: platelet-derived growth factor receptor-ligand. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The interaction between the platelet-derived growth factor receptor-ligand complex and its downstream signaling pathways has been the focus of extensive research due to its critical role in cell proliferation and tissue regeneration. Recent studies have elucidated how this protein complex propagates signals that influence angiogenesis in response to tissue ischemia. In a rodent model of myocardial infarction, the activation of the platelet-derived growth factor receptor-ligand facilitates the recruitment of endothelial progenitor cells, thereby promoting vascular repair and improving cardiac function. Furthermore, pharmacological interventions targeting this protein complex have revealed potential therapeutic avenues for the treatment of fibrotic disorders. Specifically, inhibitors of the platelet-derived growth factor receptor-ligand interaction have shown promise in reducing the excessive deposition of extracellular matrix components in pulmonary fibrosis, suggesting that modulation of this pathway could serve as a novel approach to managing this debilitating condition. As such, ongoing research endeavors continue to unravel the complexities of this protein complex and translate these findings into clinical applications for various pathologies characterized by aberrant cellular proliferation and fibrosis.
