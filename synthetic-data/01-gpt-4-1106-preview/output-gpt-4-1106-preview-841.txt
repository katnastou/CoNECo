prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: PreaT. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In a groundbreaking study, we have characterized the novel protein complex PreaT, which has emerged as a pivotal actor in the cellular response to oxidative stress—a condition implicated in the pathogenesis of numerous diseases including cancer and neurodegenerative disorders. The discovery of PreaT was facilitated by advances in mass spectrometry and protein chemistry techniques, which allowed for the isolation and identification of this multifaceted complex. Our experiments revealed that PreaT interacts with specific reactive oxygen species (ROS), suggesting a protective role in mitigating oxidative damage. Upon exposure to hydrogen peroxide—a common ROS—cellular systems demonstrated an upregulation of PreaT, coupled with a marked decrease in DNA damage markers and an increase in cell viability. Furthermore, through the use of CRISPR-Cas9 mediated gene editing in murine models, we observed that the attenuation of PreaT expression significantly exacerbated neurodegenerative phenotypes, highlighting the complex's importance in maintaining neuronal integrity. These findings offer a promising new avenue for therapeutic intervention, targeting PreaT to bolster cellular defenses against oxidative stress. Further research is proposed to delineate the precise mechanisms by which PreaT exerts its protective effects, and to investigate its potential as a biomarker or therapeutic target in oxidative stress-related diseases.
