prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: methylosome. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In a recent investigation into the post-translational modifications critical for cellular differentiation processes, the role of the methylosome complex has garnered considerable interest. The methylosome, a protein arginine methyltransferase complex, has been implicated in the substrate-specific methylation of arginine residues, an essential step in the modulation of signal transduction pathways. Observations in vitro have demonstrated that the enzymatic activity of the methylosome is significantly upregulated in response to oxidative stress, suggesting a potential mechanism for cellular adaptation to environmental stimuli. Furthermore, investigations using mammalian cell lines have elucidated the contribution of the methylosome to the regulation of mRNA processing events, highlighting its importance in the maintenance of genomic stability. Notably, dysregulation of the methylosome's activity has been associated with a range of pathological conditions, including neurodegenerative disorders such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and certain cancers, thereby presenting potential avenues for therapeutic intervention. The selective inhibition or enhancement of the methylosome activity, by means of small molecule modulators, can therefore offer novel insights into the complex interplay between epigenetic regulators and disease pathogenesis.
