prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: CPC. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In recent studies, the CPC has garnered significant interest within the field of cell division and its implication in various pathological conditions. Investigations into the role of CPC have revealed its critical function in the regulation of mitosis, with a particular focus on the proper segregation of chromosomes. Dysregulation of CPC activity has been associated with aneuploidy, contributing to the progression of diverse malignancies. Inhibitors targeting the kinase activity of CPC have shown promising therapeutic potential, with several small molecule compounds currently undergoing clinical trials. Moreover, research utilizing murine models has further elucidated the physiological importance of CPC, demonstrating that its absence leads to catastrophic mitotic failure, underscoring its viability as a target for cancer treatments. In parallel, studies on patient-derived samples have consistently shown aberrant levels of CPC in a spectrum of hematological disorders, suggesting its utility as a prognostic biomarker. The plethora of data emerging on CPC underscores the complexities of mitotic regulation and the pursuit of targeted therapies in the realm of precision medicine.
