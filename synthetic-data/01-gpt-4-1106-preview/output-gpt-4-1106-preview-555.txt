prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: FSH. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In a recent study published in the "Journal of Biomedical Research," we investigated the role of FSH in the regulation of reproductive aging. FSH, a pivotal hormone, is recognized for its significant impact on ovarian function. Our research employed a cohort of murine models to elucidate the intricate mechanisms by which FSH influences the onset of menopause. To this end, the mice were treated with varying doses of FSH, while a control group remained untreated. We observed a dose-dependent correlation between FSH levels and follicular development, with higher doses accelerating ovarian senescence. Additionally, serum analysis indicated that FSH treatment resulted in altered concentrations of estradiol, pointing to a disruption in the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis. This suggests that FSH may play a more critical role in the pathophysiology of menopause than previously understood. Our findings underscore the potential of targeting FSH in therapeutic strategies aimed at ameliorating symptoms associated with menopause, such as osteoporosis and cardiovascular disease, thus providing a promising avenue for clinical exploration.
