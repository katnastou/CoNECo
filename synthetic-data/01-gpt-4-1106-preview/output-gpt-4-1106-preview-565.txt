prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: HEPS. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The current study elucidates the role of the HEPS protein complex in the regulation of autophagy in response to oxidative stress in murine hepatic cells. Previous literature has highlighted the significance of autophagic pathways in the maintenance of cellular homeostasis and their dysregulation has been implicated in the pathophysiology of neurodegenerative disorders. In this investigation, we sought to determine the effect of increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) on the activation of the HEPS complex. Murine hepatic cells were subjected to a controlled oxidative environment, achieved through the administration of hydrogen peroxide, and subsequent changes in the level of autophagy were quantified using a combination of LC3-II turnover assays and electron microscopy. The data indicate that HEPS plays a critical role in sensing oxidative stress and instigating the autophagic response, thereby suggesting a protective mechanism against ROS-induced cellular damage. Further exploration into the signaling pathways modulated by HEPS may uncover novel therapeutic targets for diseases characterized by impaired autophagy and oxidative stress.
