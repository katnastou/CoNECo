prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: xseAB. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we investigated the role of the xseAB protein complex in DNA repair mechanisms, specifically focusing on its function within the context of Escherichia coli. The bacterium's ability to maintain genomic integrity under various stress conditions is critical for survival. Previous studies suggested that the xseAB protein complex may play a pivotal role in the excision repair pathway, contributing to the removal of damaged nucleotides from the DNA strand. We utilized a combination of CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing and quantitative PCR to observe the effects of xseAB depletion on the cellular response to ultraviolet radiation, a known inducer of DNA lesions. Cell viability assays showed a marked decrease in survival rates when the xseAB protein complex was absent, indicating its essential role in counteracting the detrimental effects of UV-induced DNA damage. Further biochemical analyses revealed that the complex may function in coordination with ATP molecules, which suggests an energy-dependent mechanism of action. Our findings propose that the xseAB protein complex is a key contributor to the maintenance of genomic stability in E. coli, a critical factor that can influence the organism's resistance to not only environmental challenges but also to the development of certain antibiotic resistances.
