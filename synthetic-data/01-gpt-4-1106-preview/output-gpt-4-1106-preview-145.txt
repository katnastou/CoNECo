prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: ESCRT3. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In a recent investigation into cellular mechanisms underlying neurodegenerative disorders, the implication of membrane trafficking pathways has been brought to light, with particular emphasis on the endosomal sorting complex required for transport, namely ESCRT3. Although previous studies have implicated autophagic dysregulation in the pathophysiology of diseases such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's, the current research delineates the nuanced role that ESCRT3 plays in the degradation and turnover of cellular cargo. Through a series of in vitro assays using murine models, it was observed that disturbances in the ESCRT3 complex contribute significantly to the aberrant accumulation of protein aggregates, a hallmark of neuronal degeneration. Fluorescent microscopy illustrated that neurons with compromised ESCRT3 functionality exhibited marked disruptions in lysosomal acidification, pointing to a critical role in endolysosomal trafficking. Additionally, patient-derived fibroblasts exhibiting reduced levels of ESCRT3 displayed elongated clearance times for exogenously applied amyloid-beta, reinforcing the therapeutic potential of targeting this complex in ameliorating protein aggregation-related neurotoxicity. Collectively, these findings reveal that ESCRT3 is a key modulator of pathological processes in neurodegenerative diseases and warrants further exploration as a promising target for drug development.
