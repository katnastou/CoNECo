prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: laminin 3B32. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In a recent groundbreaking study, the effects of laminin 3B32 on cellular adhesion in murine models were investigated. The research focused on the interaction between laminin 3B32 and integrins on the surface of cardiac fibroblasts. Experimental results indicated that exposure to laminin 3B32 significantly enhanced the adhesion properties of these fibroblasts, which was quantified through a series of assays involving fluorescence microscopy and atomic force microscopy. Additionally, the study explored the downstream signaling pathways activated upon laminin 3B32 binding, which suggested a pivotal role for this protein complex in mediating cellular responses to extracellular matrix composition changes. Specifically, the phosphorylation status of FAK (focal adhesion kinase) was markedly altered in the presence of laminin 3B32, implicating this complex as a crucial modulator in the mechanotransduction process. Furthermore, in vivo administration of laminin 3B32 in mice subjected to induced myocardial infarction resulted in a reduction of fibrotic tissue formation, hinting at potential therapeutic applications for ischemic heart disease. The implications of these findings may extend to understanding the complexities of tissue remodeling and the potential development of novel regenerative strategies.
