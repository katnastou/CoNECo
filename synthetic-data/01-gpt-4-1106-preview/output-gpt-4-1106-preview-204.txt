prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: Hydrogenase-2. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In a recent study, the functioning of Hydrogenase-2 within the cellular respiration pathways of Escherichia coli has been thoroughly examined to elucidate its role in oxidative stress management. This protein complex has been implicated in the catalytic conversion of molecular hydrogen, a process essential for maintaining a balance in the cellular redox state. Under aerobic conditions, Hydrogenase-2 demonstrates a remarkable affinity for its substrate, which suggests a potential protective mechanism against the accumulation of reactive oxygen species. Researchers have deployed an array of biochemical assays coupled with high-resolution spectrometry to investigate the kinetic properties of this complex. In vivo experiments further revealed that cells deficient in Hydrogenase-2 suffered from elevated levels of oxidative damage, leading to an increased susceptibility to conditions such as accelerated aging and metabolic syndrome. These findings underscore the importance of Hydrogenase-2 in not only energy metabolism but also in the broader context of cellular defense mechanisms against oxidative stress-related pathologies.
