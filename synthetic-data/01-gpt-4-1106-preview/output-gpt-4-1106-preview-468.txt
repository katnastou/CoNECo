prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: Trf4. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In recent studies, the role of Trf4 in RNA surveillance pathways has garnered significant attention due to its implications in cellular homeostasis and disease pathology. Trf4, a poly(A) polymerase, is a crucial component of the TRAMP complex, which facilitates the degradation of aberrant RNA molecules within the nucleus. Through its enzymatic activity, Trf4 adds short oligo(A) tails to RNA substrates, marking them for subsequent processing by the exosome. This polyadenylation-mediated RNA quality control mechanism is particularly vital in the maintenance of genomic integrity, as it prevents the accumulation of potentially harmful RNA species that could lead to genomic instability or interfere with the normal expression of genes. Interestingly, aberrations in the functionality of Trf4 have been correlated with an increased incidence of certain cancers, illustrating the protein's importance in safeguarding against malignant transformation. The identification of small molecular inhibitors that can modulate Trf4 activity holds promise for therapeutic interventions in diseases where the dysregulation of RNA turnover plays a pivotal role.
