prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: Kir6.1-SUR. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In a recent study published in the Journal of Molecular Cardiology, researchers have elucidated the role of the Kir6.1-SUR protein complex in cardiac myocytes under conditions of metabolic stress. The investigation centered on determining the regulatory mechanisms that influence the activity of the Kir6.1-SUR complex during ischemic episodes. Utilizing a murine model, the team simulated ischemic conditions through the induction of hypoxic environments. Subsequent electrophysiological assays revealed that the Kir6.1-SUR complex underwent conformational changes in response to the intracellular accumulation of ADP, a by-product of compromised cellular respiration. This adaptive response appeared to modulate the influx and efflux of potassium ions across the cardiac cell membrane, thereby impacting the electrical excitability of the myocytes. Additionally, pharmacological interventions targeting the Kir6.1-SUR complex yielded alterations in the cellular action potential, suggesting a potential therapeutic avenue for the management of arrhythmias during myocardial infarction. The findings highlight the significance of the Kir6.1-SUR complex in orchestrating cellular adaptations to maintain myocardial viability in the face of metabolic insults, paving the way for further exploration into the molecular underpinnings of ischemic heart disease.
