prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: CHRAC. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In a recent study, the role of the chromatin accessibility complex (CHRAC) in the regulation of DNA repair mechanisms was scrutinized to elucidate its participation in cellular responses to genotoxic stress. Cultured human fibroblasts were exposed to ultraviolet (UV) radiation, inducing the formation of cyclobutane pyrimidine dimersâ€”a form of DNA lesion that requires nucleotide excision repair (NER) pathways for resolution. Immunofluorescence assays demonstrated a marked recruitment of CHRAC to UV-damaged sites, suggesting a direct involvement in chromatin remodeling facilitating NER. Moreover, application of siRNA techniques to reduce CHRAC expression led to a statistically significant increase in residual UV-induced DNA damage, as measured by comet assays. Such findings underscore the critical function of CHRAC in maintaining genomic integrity, which could have implications for diseases characterized by defective DNA repair, such as xeroderma pigmentosum. Furthermore, the research points to potential therapeutic targets within the CHRAC pathway that could be modulated to enhance DNA repair in pathological conditions or to sensitize cancer cells to DNA-damaging treatments.
