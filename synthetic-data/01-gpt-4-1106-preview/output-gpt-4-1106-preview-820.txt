prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: TREX-2. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In a recent landmark study, the functional characterization of the TREX-2 protein complex in mammalian cells has elucidated novel insights into the mechanisms underlying RNA export and genomic stability. Examination of murine cell lines with a conditional knockout of the TREX-2 complex revealed a marked increase in nuclear RNA accumulation, suggesting a pivotal role in the nuclear-cytoplasmic translocation process. Furthermore, upon exposure to genotoxic stress, cells deficient in TREX-2 exhibited a pronounced sensitivity to DNA damage, implicating this complex in the maintenance of genomic integrity. The researchers employed a variety of experimental techniques, including fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP), to map the interaction landscape of TREX-2 with the nuclear architecture. Biochemical assays, complemented by high-throughput RNA-sequencing, uncovered a subset of polyadenylated transcripts that accumulates in the nucleus upon loss of TREX-2 function, pointing to a potential selectivity in the RNA export pathway. Collectively, these findings advance our understanding of the multifaceted roles of TREX-2 in cellular homeostasis, with implications for diseases characterized by impaired RNA metabolism and genome instability. Future research directions involve delineating the precise molecular interactions between TREX-2 and other cellular machineries, as well as exploring the potential of targeting this complex for therapeutic interventions in the context of disease states.
