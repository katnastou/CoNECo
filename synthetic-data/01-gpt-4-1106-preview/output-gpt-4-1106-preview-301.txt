prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: axonemal dynein. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In recent studies, the functional relevance of axonemal dynein has been increasingly underscored with respect to its critical role in the motility of cilia and flagella. This protein complex is essential for the generation of the force required for the sliding of microtubules, an action paramount to the propagation of oscillatory movements in these cellular appendages. While the underlying mechanisms were once enigmatic, advanced imaging techniques have allowed for a more detailed understanding of the structural conformations and dynamic interactions implicated in axonemal dynein activity. Disruptions in the proper functioning of this protein complex have been correlated with a spectrum of ciliopathies, highlighting the need for further research into targeted therapeutic strategies. In the context of respiratory diseases, the importance of axonemal dynein becomes particularly prominent, considering that effective mucociliary clearance relies on the coordinated beating of cilia. Moreover, investigations into the modulatory influence of various ions, such as calcium, have begun to shed light on the intricate regulation of ciliary motion. These insights may pave the way for novel interventions that could rectify the compromised functionality associated with pathogenic mutations affecting this intricate protein complex.
