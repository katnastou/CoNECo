prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: replication protein A. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we sought to elucidate the role that replication protein A plays in the maintenance of genomic stability during DNA replication and repair processes. Our research focused on the interaction between replication protein A and various DNA-damaging agents, such as ultraviolet radiation and cisplatin, in both in vitro and in vivo models. Upon exposure to these agents, we observed an increased localization of replication protein A to sites of DNA damage in cultured human fibroblasts, indicative of its pivotal role in the DNA damage response pathway. Subsequent assays revealed that the presence of replication protein A is crucial for the activation of the ATR-dependent checkpoint signaling cascade, which facilitates cell cycle arrest and DNA repair mechanisms. Furthermore, our study demonstrated that impaired function of replication protein A, induced by targeted mutagenesis, led to a marked increase in chromosomal aberrations and heightened sensitivity to genotoxic stress, culminating in accelerated cellular senescence. These findings shed light on the essential function replication protein A serves in safeguarding the fidelity of DNA replication and suggest that its dysfunction may contribute to the pathogenesis of various genetic disorders, including cancer.
