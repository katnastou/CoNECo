prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: DNMT3A-3L. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In the study of epigenetic regulation, the DNMT3A-3L protein complex has emerged as a critical contributor to the establishment and maintenance of DNA methylation patterns within mammalian cells. Accumulating evidence from recent genome-wide association studies has implicated aberrations in DNMT3A-3L function in the pathogenesis of various hematological malignancies, including certain forms of leukemia. This study aimed to delineate the molecular mechanisms by which DNMT3A-3L interacts with nucleic acid substrates and chromatin-modifying enzymes to modulate gene expression. Utilizing chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing (ChIP-seq) and methyl-CpG binding domain protein-enriched genome sequencing (MBD-seq), the genome-wide distribution of DNMT3A-3L-mediated methylation patterns was mapped in both healthy and diseased human cell lines. The data revealed a complex interplay between DNMT3A-3L activity and the positioning of nucleosomes, which appears to be critical for the selective targeting of methylation events. Furthermore, pharmacological inhibition of DNMT3A-3L in a mouse model of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) demonstrated a reduction in disease progression, signifying the therapeutic potential of targeting this protein complex in certain cancers. These findings underscore the intricate role of DNMT3A-3L in epigenetic regulation and its potential as a biomarker and therapeutic target in oncology.
