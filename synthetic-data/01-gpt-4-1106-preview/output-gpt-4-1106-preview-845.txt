prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: DNA polymerase V. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In a recent study, the role of DNA polymerase V in the cellular response to ultraviolet-induced DNA damage was elucidated through a series of in vitro and in vivo experiments. Upon exposure to UV radiation, DNA lesions such as cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers are often formed, which can impede replication and transcription processes, leading to cell cycle arrest and potentially to the development of skin cancers in organisms. DNA polymerase V, a key player in the translesion synthesis pathway, is recruited to stalled replication forks where it facilitates the bypass of these lesions, allowing DNA synthesis to continue despite the presence of DNA damage. The fidelity and efficiency of DNA polymerase V were assessed by measuring the incorporation of nucleotides opposite UV-induced lesions in various substrates. Results indicated that DNA polymerase V possesses the ability to synthesize DNA with relatively high fidelity, although the rate of synthesis was reduced compared to undamaged templates. Further investigation into the kinetics of DNA polymerase V's action revealed a complex interplay between DNA repair machinery and replication machinery, underscoring the importance of temporal coordination in the cellular response to genotoxic stress. This study provides critical insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying DNA damage tolerance and has significant implications for understanding the etiology of diseases associated with defective DNA repair pathways.
