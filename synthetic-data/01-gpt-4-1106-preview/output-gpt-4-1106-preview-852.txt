prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: CENP-A containing nucleosome. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In recent investigations targeting the chromatin architecture's role in cellular division, particular attention has been given to the CENP-A containing nucleosome's influence on chromosomal stability. These specialized nucleosomes are integral to the formation of functional kinetochores, acting as pivotal contributors to the precise segregation of chromosomes during mitosis. Although the exact mechanism by which the CENP-A containing nucleosome establishes kinetochore assembly remains partially elucidated, current research has demonstrated its necessity in recruiting various kinetochore proteins. By employing Chromatin Immunoprecipitation followed by high-throughput sequencing (ChIP-seq), the distribution of the CENP-A containing nucleosome has been mapped throughout the cell cycle in several model organisms, including Homo sapiens and Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The results of these studies indicate a tightly regulated process of deposition and maintenance that ensures cellular viability. Dysfunction in the regulation of the CENP-A containing nucleosome has been implicated in aneuploidy and numerous cancer phenotypes, illustrating its critical function in maintaining genomic integrity. The elucidation of the pathways governing the dynamics of this nucleosome type provides promising avenues for the development of therapeutic interventions in chromosomal disorder treatment.
