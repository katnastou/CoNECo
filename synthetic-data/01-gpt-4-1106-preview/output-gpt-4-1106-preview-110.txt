prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: TriC. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In the recent study published in the Journal of Molecular Biology, the role of the protein complex TriC in the folding mechanism of newly synthesized peptides was delineated through a series of in vitro experiments. The assembly of TriC was shown to occur in a highly regulated manner, primarily within the cytosolic milieu of mammalian cells, wherein the complex exerts its chaperoning activity. It was observed that upon exposure to stressors such as heat shock or chemical denaturants, the expression levels of TriC increased significantly, suggesting a pivotal role in the maintenance of proteostasis under adverse conditions. Notably, the substrate specificity of TriC indicated a preference for a particular subset of polypeptides, which are essential for cellular function. Furthermore, the study explored the implications of TriC dysfunction in the pathophysiology of neurodegenerative disorders, revealing that inadequate or aberrant activity of TriC could lead to the accumulation of misfolded protein species, a hallmark of several such diseases. The therapeutic potential of modulating TriC activity to mitigate the progression of protein misfolding-related pathologies was thus proposed, opening new avenues for the development of targeted treatments.
