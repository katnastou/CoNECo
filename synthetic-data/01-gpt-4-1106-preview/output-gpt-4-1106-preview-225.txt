prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: IscA. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In the current study, we sought to elucidate the role of IscA in cellular iron homeostasis. Although the precise mechanisms remain partially understood, IscA is known to be integral to the biogenesis of iron-sulfur clusters, which serve as essential cofactors in a variety of metabolic processes. Through a series of experiments involving mammalian cell lines and Escherichia coli mutants, we probed the interaction between IscA and cellular iron pools. Our findings indicate that under conditions of iron depletion, cells exhibit decreased activity of enzymes requiring iron-sulfur clusters, coinciding with a measurable downregulation of IscA. Moreover, the overexpression of IscA under iron-replete conditions prompted an increase in the activity of these enzymes, signifying a potential feedback mechanism for sensing and responding to fluctuations in intracellular iron levels. Notably, IscA's role turned out to be critical under oxidative stress conditions, where its absence led to enhanced vulnerability, suggesting that IscA may also contribute to cellular defenses against reactive oxygen species. Our study underscores the importance of IscA in maintaining cellular iron equilibrium, a balance that is crucial for cell survival, and that disruption thereof may have implications for understanding the etiology of diseases associated with iron metabolism disorders.
