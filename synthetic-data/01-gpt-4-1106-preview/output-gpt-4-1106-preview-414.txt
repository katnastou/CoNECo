prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: U2AF. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In elucidating the mechanistic intricacies of pre-mRNA splicing, the recognition of the polypyrimidine tract adjacent to the 3' splice site has emerged as a critical step, facilitated by the U2AF. This protein complex plays an indispensable role in the spliceosome assembly, a dynamic process integral to the accurate removal of introns from pre-mRNA transcripts. The present study sought to explore the effects of various small molecule inhibitors on the function of U2AF, with a specific focus on the subsequent impact on alternative splicing patterns in mammalian cells. Through a series of in vitro and in vivo assays, including mass spectrometry and RNA-seq, we endeavored to characterize the molecular interactions between these inhibitors and the complex, as well as their potential to induce exon skipping events that are often implicated in a myriad of diseases, including certain types of cancer and neurodegenerative disorders. Initial findings suggest that targeted disruption of U2AF functions may offer a promising therapeutic strategy, warranting further investigation into the small molecules that exhibit specificity and potency against this complex.
