prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: gamma-secretase. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In a recent study, we investigated the therapeutic potential of small molecule inhibitors targeting gamma-secretase in the context of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Gamma-secretase is a multi-subunit protease complex with pivotal roles in various cellular processes, including the production of amyloid-beta (Aβ) peptides from amyloid precursor protein (APP). Accumulation of Aβ peptides in the brain is a hallmark of AD pathology; hence, modulation of gamma-secretase activity represents a compelling strategy for altering Aβ peptide generation. Utilizing murine models of AD, the administration of selective gamma-secretase inhibitors resulted in a dose-dependent reduction in Aβ peptide levels in the brain, as measured by ELISA. Furthermore, treated subjects displayed improved performance in cognitive tasks, suggesting that inhibition of gamma-secretase may attenuate the cognitive deficits associated with AD. Histological analyses supported these findings, demonstrating a noticeable decrease in amyloid plaque burden in the hippocampus and cortex of treated mice. While these results are promising, further investigations are required to assess the long-term efficacy and safety profile of gamma-secretase inhibition, as complete suppression of gamma-secretase activity could potentially disrupt other vital cellular functions.
