prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: T lymphocyte receptor. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The immune response is markedly modulated by the intricate signaling cascades initiated by the T lymphocyte receptor upon antigen recognition. In this study, the mechanism by which the T lymphocyte receptor transduces signals that culminate in cell activation was examined. Utilizing a murine model, T cells were isolated and exposed to an array of viral antigens under controlled in vitro conditions. Post-antigen exposure, the phosphorylation status of key signaling molecules was quantified via Western blot, elucidating the temporal sequence of intracellular events following T lymphocyte receptor engagement. Additionally, calcium flux within T cells, an early event subsequent to T lymphocyte receptor activation, was assessed using a fluorescent indicator. This allowed for the determination of the concentration of calcium ions released from intracellular stores, a critical step in T lymphocyte activation. Concurrently, cytokine profiles were measured to establish a link between T lymphocyte receptor signaling and the functional outcomes of T cell activation, such as proliferation and differentiation. The findings highlight the exquisite sensitivity of the T lymphocyte receptor to antigenic stimuli, and further understanding of its signaling pathway could pave the way for novel therapeutic strategies in the treatment of autoimmune diseases where T cell activation plays a pivotal role.
