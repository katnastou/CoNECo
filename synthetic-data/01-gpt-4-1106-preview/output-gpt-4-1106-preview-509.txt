prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: nuclear cohesin. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: Recent studies have illuminated the pivotal role of the nuclear cohesin complex in the maintenance of chromosomal architecture and its implications for cellular health and pathology. The dynamic regulation of this complex has been observed to be critical in facilitating sister chromatid cohesion, DNA repair, and gene expression regulation. Disruption of nuclear cohesin function, due to either environmental factors or intrinsic genetic anomalies, has been correlated with the pathogenesis of various developmental disorders and has been increasingly studied in the context of cancer. Investigations using model organisms, such as Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Drosophila melanogaster, have allowed researchers to elucidate the pathways and mechanisms through which nuclear cohesin exerts its effects at the cellular level. Moreover, pharmacological interventions aiming to modulate the activity of this complex are being explored as potential therapeutic strategies in disease states characterized by cohesinopathies. Advanced techniques, including chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing (ChIP-seq), have provided insights into the genome-wide distribution and function of nuclear cohesin, revealing the importance of its precise regulation for the integrity of the genome and normal cell cycle progression.
