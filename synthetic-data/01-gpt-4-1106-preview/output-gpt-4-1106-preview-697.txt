prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: mitochondrial complex III. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In the exploration of cellular energy production, mitochondrial complex III plays a pivotal role in the electron transport chain, a critical step for the synthesis of adenosine triphosphate (ATP). Recent studies have elucidated that the function of mitochondrial complex III is not solely restricted to its well-known role in oxidative phosphorylation but is also implicated in the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which can have both beneficial and detrimental effects on cellular homeostasis. For instance, ROS production at low levels can serve as signaling molecules in various biological processes, whereas at high concentrations, they are associated with oxidative damage, contributing to the pathogenesis of disorders such as Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease. The activity of mitochondrial complex III has been shown to be modulated by the presence of specific lipids within the mitochondrial membrane, influencing its efficiency and susceptibility to pharmacological agents. Further, the study of mitochondrial complex III might provide insights into the mechanisms of metabolic diseases and offer new therapeutic avenues by targeting its activity. It is, therefore, crucial to continue investigating mitochondrial complex III dynamics using advanced techniques such as cryo-electron microscopy for high-resolution structural analysis, which may reveal novel aspects of its function and regulation within the cell.
