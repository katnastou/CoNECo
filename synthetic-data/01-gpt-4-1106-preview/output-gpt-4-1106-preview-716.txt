prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: Sm. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we investigate the role of the Sm protein complex in cellular regulatory pathways associated with RNA processing events. Previous research has identified the central significance of this complex in the biogenesis of small nuclear ribonucleoproteins (snRNPs), which are essential components of the spliceosome machinery. Utilizing both *in vivo* and *in vitro* models, we specifically examined how the Sm complex influences the splicing of pre-mRNA in mammalian cells under stress conditions, such as oxidative damage induced by hydrogen peroxide. Our observations reveal that cells with compromised Sm complex activity exhibit a marked reduction in splicing efficiency, leading to an accumulation of unprocessed pre-mRNA and a subsequent increase in cellular apoptosis rates. Intriguingly, these effects were particularly pronounced in neurons, suggesting a potential link between Sm complex dysfunction and neurodegenerative disorders. This indicates that the Sm complex not only plays a pivotal role in the maintenance of normal cellular function but may also be implicated in the pathophysiology of diseases characterized by RNA metabolism defects. Through a combination of molecular assays and high-throughput RNA sequencing, we further characterized the interaction between the Sm complex and specific RNA substrates, setting the stage for targeted therapeutic strategies to mitigate the detrimental effects of dysregulated RNA processing in diseases.
