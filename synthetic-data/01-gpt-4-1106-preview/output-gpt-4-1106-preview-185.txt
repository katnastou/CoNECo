prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: Cystine/glutamate antiporter system xc. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In a recent study aimed at elucidating the molecular mechanisms underlying oxidative stress in neurodegenerative disorders, the functioning of the Cystine/glutamate antiporter system xc was investigated for its role in maintaining glutathione levels within neuronal cells. This antiporter is critical for the exchange of extracellular cystine for intracellular glutamate, a process that is instrumental in the synthesis of glutathione, the principal antioxidant within the central nervous system. Disruption of the Cystine/glutamate antiporter system xc can lead to a decrease in intracellular glutathione, aggravating oxidative stress and potentiating neuronal damage. In an in vivo murine model, observations indicated that impairment of the Cystine/glutamate antiporter system xc exacerbated symptoms associated with Parkinson's disease, further implicating its importance in the pathophysiology of the disease. Moreover, pharmacological upregulation of this antiporter system demonstrated a protective effect, suggesting a potential therapeutic avenue. This underscores the significance of the Cystine/glutamate antiporter system xc in neuronal antioxidant defense mechanisms and highlights its prospective value as a target for intervention in the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases.
