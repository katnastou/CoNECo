prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: mitochondrial cytochrome bc1. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In the present study, we sought to investigate the regulatory mechanisms governing the function of the mitochondrial cytochrome bc1 complex in cellular metabolism and its implications in the pathogenesis of metabolic disorders. It is widely recognized that the aforementioned complex plays a pivotal role in the mitochondrial electron transport chain, a process essential for ATP production through oxidative phosphorylation. To elucidate the activity of the complex, rat liver mitochondria were isolated and subjected to various conditions that mimic metabolic stress, including the presence of high glucose concentrations and oxidative agents such as hydrogen peroxide. ATP synthesis rates were quantitatively measured using a luciferase-based assay, providing insight into the efficiency of energy production under these stressors. Furthermore, the potential involvement of mitochondrial cytochrome bc1 in the development of type 2 diabetes was evaluated by assessing its activity in murine models genetically predisposed to the disease. Our findings suggest that dysfunction in this complex may lead to diminished ATP production, contributing to the cellular energy deficit observed in type 2 diabetes. These results underline the importance of maintaining mitochondrial cytochrome bc1 activity for metabolic homeostasis and highlight the complex as a potential therapeutic target for intervention in metabolic diseases.
