prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: MetNI. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we investigated the impact of MetNI on the transport of methionine across bacterial membranes. MetNI, a highly conserved protein complex found in a wide range of bacterial species, has been suggested to play a critical role in the uptake of this essential amino acid. Utilizing Escherichia coli as a model organism, we observed that cells deficient in MetNI exhibited a marked decrease in growth rate when cultured in a medium limited in methionine, compared to wild-type controls. Furthermore, radiolabeled methionine uptake assays revealed that MetNI-deficient cells showed a significant reduction in amino acid import efficiency. Additional experiments aimed at assessing the interaction between MetNI and the cell membrane indicated that MetNI possesses an intrinsic affinity for the lipid bilayer, which might facilitate its function in the transport process. These findings suggest that MetNI is integral to bacterial methionine homeostasis and could be a potential target for novel antibacterial agents, particularly in pathogenic strains where methionine uptake is vital for virulence and survival in the host environment.
