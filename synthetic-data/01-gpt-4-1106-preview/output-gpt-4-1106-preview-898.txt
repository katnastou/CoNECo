prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: RNR. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The remarkable ability of RNR to regulate deoxyribonucleotide synthesis underscores its vital role in maintaining the integrity of the genome across a wide array of organism taxa. In the current study, we have elucidated the mechanistic intricacies underpinning the RNR catalytic cycle and its responsiveness to cellular dNTP levels. Our experiments involved the systematic exposure of cultured human epithelial cells to varying concentrations of hydroxyurea, a well-documented inhibitor of RNR. We observed that upon inhibitor treatment, there was a notable decrease in DNA synthesis, as evidenced by diminished BrdU incorporation, which is consistent with the established role of RNR in providing the deoxyribonucleotide precursors necessary for DNA replication. These findings were further substantiated through cell cycle analysis, where an accumulation of cells in the S phase supported the hypothesis of a hydroxyurea-induced blockade of DNA synthesis at the point where RNR activity is critical. Additionally, we evaluated the impact of RNR inhibition on the cellular response to oxidative stress, since reactive oxygen species (ROS) are known to influence RNR activity. We posit that elucidating the response of RNR to cellular stressors will enhance our understanding of its potential as a target in therapeutic strategies for diseases characterized by aberrant DNA synthesis, such as cancer. Our findings suggest that the modulation of RNR activity can serve as a pivotal control point not only for DNA replication but also for the preservation of genomic stability under stress conditions.
