prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: Flexilin. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The identification and characterization of the Flexilin protein complex has added depth to our understanding of cellular motility processes. Recent studies have demonstrated that Flexilin is integral to the modulation of cytoskeletal dynamics within mammalian cells, particularly in the context of actin filament assembly and disassembly. Although the exact composition of Flexilin and the full range of its interactions remain incompletely resolved, preliminary data suggest a pivotal role in the transduction of biochemical signals that govern cellular responses to extracellular matrix adhesion. Investigations using murine models have implicated Flexilin in the efficient wound healing process, highlighting a potential link between Flexilin function and the intricate mechanisms of tissue repair. Further analysis through mass spectrometry and advanced immunoprecipitation techniques may unravel its association with specific phosphorylation events in response to growth factors such as platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF). In pathological conditions like cancer, deviations in Flexilin expression levels have been observed, suggesting a possible relevance for this complex in neoplastic cell migration and invasion, which warrants a more thorough investigation into its therapeutic targeting potential.
