prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: mitotic septin. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: During the intricate process of cell division, the mitotic septin complex plays a critical regulatory role in maintaining cellular integrity and facilitating cytokinesis. This study investigated the interplay between the mitotic septin complex and the cell's microtubule architecture during metaphase to anaphase transition, using mammalian cell lines as a model organism. Live cell imaging coupled with fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) assays revealed that the mitotic septin complex dynamically associates with the mitotic spindle, suggesting a nuanced role in spindle stability and the localization of cytokinetic machinery. Chemical inhibition of spindle assembly resulted in altered mitotic septin dynamics, underscoring its potential responsiveness to microtubule disorganization. Moreover, cells exhibiting aberrant mitotic septin complex activity displayed an increased rate of aneuploidy and subsequent growth arrest, indicating its importance in genome stability and cell viability. This research contributes to our understanding of septin function in cell division and its implications in the development of aneuploidy-related diseases, such as cancer. Further elucidation of the mitotic septin complex may offer novel therapeutic targets for the management of proliferative disorders.
