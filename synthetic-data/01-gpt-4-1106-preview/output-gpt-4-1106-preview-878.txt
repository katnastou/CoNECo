prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: VPS4. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In a recent study aimed at elucidating the mechanisms underlying lysosomal dysfunction in neurodegenerative diseases, particular attention was given to the role of the VPS4 protein complex. The study involved both in vitro and in vivo experiments, predominantly using murine models and human neuronal cell lines. Remarkably, it was observed that dysregulation of the endosomal sorting process, in which VPS4 is a critical actor, could be linked to an accumulation of autophagic vacuoles. These vacuoles displayed aberrant characteristics, potentially contributing to the pathogenesis of conditions akin to Alzheimerâ€™s disease. Through the administration of a small-molecule inhibitor specifically targeting VPS4, researchers were able to observe a reduction in the aforementioned vacuolar accumulation, suggesting a therapeutic window. Additionally, biochemical assays revealed that the ATPase activity of VPS4 is crucial for its function, as ATPase-inactive mutants of VPS4 failed to rescue the lysosomal phenotype. This suggests a direct correlation between VPS4 ATPase activity and the maintenance of cellular homeostasis. The results implicate VPS4 as a viable target for pharmacological intervention in the treatment of lysosomal storage disorders and related neurodegenerative diseases, warranting further investigation into the development of VPS4-modulating drugs.
