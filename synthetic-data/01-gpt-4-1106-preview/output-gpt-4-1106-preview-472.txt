prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: SOSS. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In a recent study published in the *Journal of Molecular Biomedicine*, we investigated the cellular response to DNA damage, with a particular focus on the role of the SOSS protein complex. The effectiveness of the SOSS complex in orchestrating DNA repair mechanisms was examined across various human cell lines subjected to ultraviolet irradiation. Results indicated that cells employing the SOSS complex exhibited a marked increase in repair efficiency and a subsequent decrease in mutation frequency, suggesting the complex plays a crucial role in maintaining genomic stability. Furthermore, the application of small molecule inhibitors targeting DNA repair pathways revealed that the SOSS complex operates independently of the canonical base excision repair process. This was corroborated by co-immunoprecipitation assays, which demonstrated that the SOSS complex does not physically interact with known base excision repair proteins. Importantly, in clinical samples from patients with xeroderma pigmentosum, a condition characterized by extreme sensitivity to sunlight and predisposition to skin cancer, a correlation between reduced SOSS complex activity and increased disease severity was observed. These findings shed light on the potential of the SOSS complex as a therapeutic target and lay the groundwork for future pharmacological studies aimed at enhancing DNA repair in diseases with compromised genomic integrity.
