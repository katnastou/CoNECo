prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: cullin-RING ligase 5. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we investigated the role of cullin-RING ligase 5 in the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway and its implications in the pathogenesis of colorectal cancer. Utilizing a series of in vitro assays followed by in vivo experiments in murine models, we sought to delineate the molecular mechanics through which cullin-RING ligase 5 mediates the ubiquitination and subsequent degradation of specific target substrates implicated in cell cycle regulation and apoptosis. The timely degradation of these substrates is critical for maintaining cellular homeostasis, and dysregulation of this process has been associated with tumorigenesis. Moreover, the application of small molecule inhibitors to disrupt the activity of cullin-RING ligase 5 revealed a substantial reduction in tumor growth and improved survival outcomes, shedding light on the therapeutic potential of targeting this protein complex in colorectal cancer treatment. Our data suggest that cullin-RING ligase 5 is a crucial modulator of proteostasis, with significant repercussions for both the understanding of cellular dynamics and the advancement of clinical interventions in oncology.
