prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: surface IgG3. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In a recent investigation into the immunological response to bacterial infections, the role of the surface IgG3 protein complex has been elucidated with greater specificity. This study employed a cohort of murine models, designed to mimic the human immune system's intricacies, to determine the efficacy of surface IgG3 in the recognition and neutralization of invasive Streptococcus pneumoniae. Through a series of in vivo assays, it was observed that the presence of surface IgG3 significantly enhanced phagocytic uptake by macrophages, culminating in a pronounced decrease in bacterial load within host tissues. Moreover, quantification of cytokine levels indicated that the interaction between surface IgG3 and the pathogen markedly upregulated the secretion of interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis factor-alpha, thus bolstering the inflammatory response. Notably, the absence of surface IgG3 led to exacerbated disease progression, underlining its critical function in host defense. These results offer profound insights into the mechanisms by which humoral immunity mediates protection against pneumococcal disease, opening avenues for novel therapeutic interventions targeting surface IgG3-mediated pathways.
