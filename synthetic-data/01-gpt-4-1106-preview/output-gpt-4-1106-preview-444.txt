prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: LSU. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: Recent advances in structural biology have provided a deeper understanding of the ribosomal large subunit (LSU) and its intricate role in protein synthesis. The elucidation of the LSU's high-resolution structure through cryo-electron microscopy has afforded researchers the unique opportunity to study its interaction with various ligands and antibiotics, delineating potential therapeutic targets for antibiotic-resistant pathogens. Notably, the peptidyl transferase activity of the LSU is critically influenced by the presence of specific divalent metal ions such as magnesium and calcium, which stabilize the tertiary structure of the catalytic center, thus ensuring efficient peptide bond formation. In investigations of LSU-related pathologies, aberrations in the LSU have been implicated in a spectrum of ribosomopathies, such as Diamond-Blackfan anemia. Furthermore, targeting the LSU with small molecule inhibitors is an active area of research in the design of novel antineoplastic agents, as certain malignancies demonstrate altered ribosome biogenesis and function. Therefore, the scrutiny of LSU dynamics and pathology offers promising avenues for the development of targeted therapies across a spectrum of diseases.
