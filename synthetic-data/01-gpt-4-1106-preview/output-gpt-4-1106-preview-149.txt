output: In this study, we sought to elucidate the cellular mechanisms underlying the uptake of iron, a critical trace element essential to numerous biological processes, such as respiration and DNA synthesis. The indispensable role of iron necessitates a tightly regulated homeostasis within the organism, particularly offered that excess iron can catalyze the formation of harmful free radicals. Previous research has underscored the significance of the Ferric coprogen receptor in mediating the uptake of iron bound to coprogen, a siderophore produced by certain species of fungi for iron chelation and transport. Our investigation utilized murine models and targeted assays to assess the function of the Ferric coprogen receptor in hepatic iron metabolism. Mice were administered radioactively labeled iron in the form of ^59Fe-coprogen, following which tissue distribution studies were performed. Data revealed that the liver, the central organ for iron metabolism, displayed a marked increase in radioactivity, indicative of the Ferric coprogen receptor facilitating iron uptake. Subsequent immunohistochemical analyses localized the receptor predominantly to the hepatocytes. Furthermore, in vivo experiments conducted under iron-deficient and iron-overload conditions allowed us to observe the dynamic regulation of the Ferric coprogen receptor, correlating with the physiological demand for iron. This pattern suggests that the Ferric coprogen receptor plays a crucial role not only in iron uptake but also in the maintenance of iron homeostasis. Our results contribute to the understanding of iron acquisition pathways and have potential implications for the development of therapeutic strategies for iron-related disorders, such as hereditary hemochromatosis and anemia of chronic disease.
