prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: exodeoxyribonuclease VII. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In our recent investigation, we sought to elucidate the mechanisms underlying the repair of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) in the model organism *Escherichia coli*. One key enzyme that emerged from our studies was exodeoxyribonuclease VII, a critical player in the base excision repair pathway. DSBs are highly lethal lesions that can lead to genomic instability and, if left unresolved, to cell death. Our results indicated that once a DSB is detected within the genomic DNA, a cascade of signaling pathways is activated, among which the recruitment of exodeoxyribonuclease VII is paramount. The reparative action commenced by this enzyme is essential for the processing of the 3'-overhangs, which can obstruct downstream ligation events. Upon introduction of exogenous genotoxic agents such as ionizing radiation or methylating chemicals, the importance of exodeoxyribonuclease VII was further underscored; cells deficient in this enzyme exhibited markedly increased sensitivity to such agents. This hypersensitivity phenotype was indicative of the pivotal role played by exodeoxyribonuclease VII in maintaining genomic integrity under conditions of DNA damage stress. Our observations not only enhance the understanding of bacterial DNA repair processes but may also provide insights into the conservation of DNA repair mechanisms across different domains of life, with implicit implications for improving strategies to tackle diseases characterized by genomic instability, such as cancer.
