prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: NEXT. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: Recent advancements in our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying RNA processing have underscored the critical role of the NEXT complex in mediating the degradation of aberrant nuclear exosomal targeting. The NEXT complex, characterized by its unique constellation of enzymatic and RNA-binding properties, has been implicated in the maintenance of RNA homeostasis within the eukaryotic cell nucleus. In a comprehensive series of experiments, we sought to elucidate the contribution of NEXT to the fidelity of mRNA splicing events, employing a range of cell lines deficient in various RNA surveillance factors. Utilizing high-throughput RNA sequencing to catalogue splicing anomalies and subsequent targeted mass spectrometry to assess NEXT complex integrity and function, our findings suggest a pivotal role for NEXT in the recognition and rapid turnover of misprocessed RNAs. Importantly, our study reveals that disruptions in NEXT-mediated pathways lead to the accumulation of spliced RNA byproducts, which have the potential to perturb cellular homeostasis and are associated with the pathogenesis of a spectrum of myelodysplastic syndromes. These results offer a novel perspective on the potential interventional strategies targeting RNA quality control mechanisms, which may prove beneficial in the development of therapies for diseases where RNA processing is compromised.
