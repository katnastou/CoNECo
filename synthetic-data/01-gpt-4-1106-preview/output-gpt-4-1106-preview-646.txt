prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: TRAP. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In the novel exploration of cellular signaling pathways implicated in oncogenesis, the focus has recently shifted towards the investigation of the TRAP protein complex and its regulatory role in mediating response to therapy. The current study aimed at elucidating the mechanistic contributions of TRAP in various cell lines under treatment with a panel of chemotherapeutic agents, including cisplatin and doxorubicin. Utilizing quantitative proteomics, we observed a consistent upregulation of TRAP in cells demonstrating resistance to these agents, suggesting a possible involvement in the activation of survival pathways. Furthermore, RNA interference-based knockdown of TRAP resulted in a marked decrease in proliferation rates and an increase in apoptosis, providing compelling evidence for its role in chemoresistance. Intriguingly, our findings also extend to a broader physiological context, revealing a considerable elevation of TRAP in tissue samples derived from patients with colorectal carcinoma as opposed to adjacent healthy mucosa. These preliminary data warrant a more comprehensive investigation into TRAP as a potential therapeutic target and prognostic biomarker, offering new inroads in the battle against drug-resistant malignancies.
