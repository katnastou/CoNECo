prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: PDGF-AA-receptor alpha. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In a recently published study in the Journal of Molecular Biomedicine, researchers sought to elucidate the signaling pathways mediated by the PDGF-AA-receptor alpha complex in the context of angiogenesis. Utilizing a combination of in vitro and in vivo models, including primary endothelial cell cultures and murine models of tissue regeneration, the team investigated the downstream effects of PDGF-AA-receptor alpha activation. Their results indicate that engagement of this receptor by its ligand leads to a cascade of intracellular events, characterized by elevated levels of phosphorylated kinases and transcription factors known to be pivotal in the angiogenic process. Notably, disruption of PDGF-AA-receptor alpha signaling impaired vascular formation in a wound healing assay, suggesting a critical role for this complex in physiological angiogenesis. Importantly, the study also explored the therapeutic potential of targeted inhibitors in pathological states such as cancer, where aberrant activity of the PDGF-AA-receptor alpha complex can contribute to tumor vascularization and growth. These findings underscore the importance of the PDGF-AA-receptor alpha in both normal and disordered tissue biology, presenting new avenues for the development of anti-angiogenic strategies in disease treatment.
