prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: FcgRI. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In a recent study focused on elucidating the mechanisms underlying immunotherapy response, we investigated the role of FcgRI in the modulation of effector functions within the immune microenvironment of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Immunohistochemical analysis, coupled with flow cytometry, was employed to assess the expression and activity of FcgRI on a cohort of tumor-infiltrating leukocytes isolated from patient-derived tumor biopsies. The assessment revealed a notable upregulation of FcgRI in cases responsive to checkpoint inhibitor therapy when compared to non-responders. This upregulation correlated with an increased incidence of antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC), suggesting that FcgRI may serve as a potential biomarker for predicting treatment efficacy. Furthermore, in vitro assays demonstrated that blockade of FcgRI using specific antagonists resulted in a significant reduction in the cytotoxic activity of NK cells, implicating this receptor complex in the potentiation of ADCC phenomena. Collectively, these findings delineate a crucial role for FcgRI in the orchestration of immune effector functions and underscore its potential as a therapeutic target to enhance the efficacy of immunotherapeutic strategies in the treatment of NSCLC.
