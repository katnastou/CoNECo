prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: alphaM-beta2 integrin. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In a recent study published in the *Journal of Molecular Immunology*, the involvement of alphaM-beta2 integrin in the regulation of leukocyte adhesion and transmigration across the endothelium was examined. The primary focus of the investigation centered on the dynamic interaction between alphaM-beta2 integrin and various inflammatory mediators in the context of acute inflammatory response. Utilizing a combination of in vitro and in vivo models, including murine models of induced inflammation, the research revealed a critical role for alphaM-beta2 integrin in facilitating the firm adhesion of leukocytes to the vascular endothelium under shear flow conditions commonly found within arterial segments. Administration of targeted antagonistic agents that specifically interfere with alphaM-beta2 integrin function led to a marked reduction in leukocyte extravasation into tissues, thereby attenuating the signs and symptoms associated with inflammation. Moreover, biochemical assays suggested that the binding affinity of alphaM-beta2 integrin is modulated by the presence of divalent cations, such as Mg^2+ and Ca^2+, which are essential for maintaining the structural conformation required for ligand interactions. These findings highlight the potential of targeting alphaM-beta2 integrin as a therapeutic strategy in the treatment of inflammatory diseases, paving the way for the development of new anti-adhesive therapies that could provide relief for patients suffering from conditions characterized by excessive leukocyte infiltration, such as rheumatoid arthritis and acute lung injury.
