prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: parCE. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we investigate the functional role of the parCE protein complex in the regulation of cellular mitosis in Homo sapiens. The parCE complex has been hypothesized to play a critical role in the spatial and temporal coordination of chromosome segregation, a vital aspect of cell division. Utilizing an array of experimental approaches, including fluorescence microscopy and siRNA-mediated knockdown, we have elucidated the impact of parCE depletion on kinetochore-microtubule attachment stability. Our findings suggest that reduced levels of parCE lead to an increase in aneuploid cells, indicative of impaired mitotic fidelity. Moreover, mass spectrometry analysis revealed a potential interaction between parCE and several mitosis-regulating kinases, the disruption of which could elucidate the mechanistic pathways underlying diseases such as cancer. This research provides new insights into the complex network of protein interactions essential for accurate cell division and underlines the importance of parCE in maintaining genomic stability. Further studies are warranted to unravel the therapeutic potential of targeting parCE in mitotic dysregulation-associated pathologies.
