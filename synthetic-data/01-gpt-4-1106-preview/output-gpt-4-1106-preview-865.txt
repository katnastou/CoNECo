prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: eukaryotic translation initiation factor 3. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In the quest to elucidate mechanisms of translational control, the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 3 (eIF3) has emerged as a fundamental node in the regulatory network. This protein complex is instrumental in the assembly of the 43S pre-initiation complex, a critical step in the translation initiation pathway. Recent studies employing cryo-electron microscopy have revealed novel insights into the structural conformation of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 3, shedding light on its dynamic interactions with the small ribosomal subunit. Disruptions in the function of this complex have been implicated in a spectrum of pathologies, indicating a possible correlation between aberrant activity of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 3 and the onset of certain cancers. Therapeutic strategies targeting the regulation of this protein complex may hold promise for intervention in disease states characterized by dysregulated protein synthesis. Advances in high-throughput screening methods have facilitated the identification of small-molecule modulators that could potentially restore normal function of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 3, representing a burgeoning avenue of research with vast implications for the field of molecular medicine.
