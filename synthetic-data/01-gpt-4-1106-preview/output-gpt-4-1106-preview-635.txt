prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: 54S mitochondrial large ribosomal subunit. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: Recent studies have revealed critical insights into the importance of the 54S mitochondrial large ribosomal subunit in relation to oxidative phosphorylation efficiency within Homo sapiens. An investigation into the biogenesis and function of this subunit showcases a vital relationship with the cellular energy metabolism, particularly in high-demand tissues such as cardiac and skeletal muscles. Disruptions in the structural integrity of the 54S mitochondrial large ribosomal subunit have been associated with a range of mitochondrial myopathies, underscoring its significance in maintaining mitochondrial proteostasis. Moreover, the subunitâ€™s role in the translation of essential mitochondrial-encoded polypeptides highlights its contribution to the proper assembly and function of the electron transport chain complexes. The modulation of this subunit's activity by various pharmacological agents, including specific antibiotics and metabolic intermediates, suggests potential therapeutic avenues for mitochondrial disorders. This relationship is further elaborated by observing the changes in the subunit's activity under pathological conditions such as neurodegenerative diseases, where mitochondrial dysfunction plays a critical etiological role. Consequently, investigating the regulation and anomalies of the 54S mitochondrial large ribosomal subunit may pave the way for developing targeted interventions that could ameliorate mitochondrial-related pathologies and improve cellular bioenergetics.
