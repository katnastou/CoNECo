prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: Amiloride-sensitive sodium channel, ENaC. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The Amiloride-sensitive sodium channel, ENaC, plays a pivotal role in the regulation of sodium balance and fluid homeostasis in multicellular organisms, particularly in epithelial tissues of the kidney, lung, and distal colon. Recent studies have demonstrated that the modulation of the activity of the Amiloride-sensitive sodium channel, ENaC, is linked to the pathophysiology of hypertension, showcasing its importance as a potential therapeutic target. In a groundbreaking study, our laboratory employed quantitative proteomics to unravel the intricate signaling pathways that govern the activity of the Amiloride-sensitive sodium channel, ENaC. Through meticulous analysis, we observed a remarkable increase in channel activity in response to aldosterone, which correlated with enhanced transepithelial sodium transport. Conversely, inhibition of this channel with the diuretic amiloride led to a significant decrease in sodium reabsorption, validating the channel's role in maintaining electrolyte equilibrium. Additionally, our investigation involved in vivo models of cystic fibrosis, to evaluate how dysregulation of the Amiloride-sensitive sodium channel, ENaC, could contribute to the improper clearance of airway mucus, a hallmark of the disease. The findings from this research not only underscore the Amiloride-sensitive sodium channel, ENaC's central position in sodium and fluid management but also illuminate potential intervention points for the development of new treatments for hypertension and cystic fibrosis.
