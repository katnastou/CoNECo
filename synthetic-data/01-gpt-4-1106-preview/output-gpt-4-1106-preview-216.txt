prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: NMS. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we investigated the influence of the NMS complex on cellular proliferation under the stress of oxidative conditions. Human fibroblast cultures were exposed to hydrogen peroxide (H₂O₂) to induce oxidative stress and the subsequent cellular response was monitored in the presence and absence of the NMS complex. Our results revealed that cells harboring an intact NMS complex demonstrated a markedly higher resilience to oxidative damage, as evidenced by a decrease in lipid peroxidation markers and a lower incidence of apoptosis relative to controls. Furthermore, real-time PCR analysis indicated that the presence of NMS correlates with increased expression of antioxidant enzymes, suggesting a possible role of NMS in the transcriptional regulation of cellular protective mechanisms. Intriguingly, subjecting Caenorhabditis elegans to similar oxidative conditions elucidated a conserved role for the NMS complex across species, as those with a robust expression of NMS exhibited a significant extension in lifespan compared to their counterparts. This study provides novel insights into the pivotal role of the NMS complex in modulating oxidative stress responses and emphasizes its potential as a therapeutic target in diseases characterized by oxidative damage, such as neurodegenerative disorders and cancer.
