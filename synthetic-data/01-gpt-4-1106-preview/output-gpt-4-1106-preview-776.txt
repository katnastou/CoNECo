prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: Tenascin-N. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The recent emergence of Tenascin-N as a pivotal player in neural tissue repair has garnered considerable attention in the field of regenerative medicine. In this study, we sought to elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying the contribution of Tenascin-N to the cellular dynamics at injury sites within the central nervous system. Utilizing an in vivo rodent model of spinal cord injury, immunohistochemical analyses revealed a temporal and spatial increase in Tenascin-N expression, prominently localized at the perilesional area. Functional assays conducted on primary neuronal cultures demonstrated that the presence of Tenascin-N significantly enhanced neurite outgrowth, suggesting a facilitative role in neuronal regeneration. Additionally, pharmacological inhibition of metalloproteinases, known to process extracellular matrix components, attenuated the release of Tenascin-N, implicating these enzymes in the modulation of its bioavailability. Collectively, our findings reinforce the notion that Tenascin-N is an essential modulator of neural repair processes, offering novel insights with potential therapeutic implications for spinal cord injuries and neurodegenerative disorders.
