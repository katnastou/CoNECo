prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: interleukin-13 receptor. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In a recent groundbreaking study, the therapeutic implications of targeting the interleukin-13 receptor in the treatment of atopic dermatitis were explored. The clinical trials exhibited a remarkable trend wherein subjects displaying severe manifestations of the disease experienced significant alleviation of symptoms when administered with agents that modulate the activity of the interleukin-13 receptor. The efficacy of the treatment was evaluated through a series of immunohistochemical analyses, revealing a reduction in dermal inflammation and an attenuated response in the immune system's signalling pathways. Notably, the infiltration of eosinophils and the subsequent release of cytotoxic granules were markedly diminished. The findings suggest that the interaction between the interleukin-13 receptor and the associated inflammatory mediators plays a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of atopic dermatitis. These results hold promising therapeutic potential, indicating that the interleukin-13 receptor may serve as a novel target for intervention in immune-mediated inflammatory diseases. Additionally, the safety profile of the receptor-modulating agents was characterized by a low incidence of adverse effects, demonstrating a favorable risk-benefit ratio that encourages further development of tailored treatments based on the modulation of the interleukin-13 receptor.
