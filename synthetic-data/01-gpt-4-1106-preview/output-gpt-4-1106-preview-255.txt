prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: MKS module. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The recent study aimed at elucidating the role of the MKS module in ciliopathies has provided new insights into the pathogenesis of these disorders. Utilizing a murine model, we examined the phenotypic outcomes following targeted disruptions in the signaling pathways associated with the MKS module. Immunohistochemical analyses revealed that the absence of the functional MKS module led to aberrant ciliary morphology, primarily affecting the renal tubular epithelial cells and retinal photoreceptor cells. Additionally, the disrupted MKS module signaling was correlated with increased levels of cellular stress markers, including reactive oxygen species and nitric oxide, in affected tissues. These alterations were accompanied by a subsequent decline in renal function and a progressive deterioration of visual acuity, consistent with the clinical manifestations observed in patients with ciliopathies. Pharmacological interventions aiming to mitigate cellular stress were applied, resulting in a partial rescue of the phenotype, suggesting a potential therapeutic avenue. The findings underscore the critical role of the MKS module in maintaining ciliary integrity and highlight its importance as a target for intervention in ciliopathy-associated morbidities.
