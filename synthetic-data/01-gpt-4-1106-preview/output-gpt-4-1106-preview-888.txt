prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: nucleotide-excision repair factor 4. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The elucidation of the dynamic interplay between various DNA repair mechanisms and cellular homeostasis remains a cornerstone in understanding the molecular underpinnings of genome integrity. A prime example of this interplay is the critical involvement of nucleotide-excision repair factor 4 (NERF4) in repairing bulky DNA adducts induced by ultraviolet radiation and certain chemical agents. Recently, a novel study has dissected the role of NERF4 within the nucleotide-excision repair (NER) pathway, suggesting a modulatory function that orchestrates the recruitment and stabilization of the repair complex at sites of DNA damage. Functional assays employing in vitro reconstituted systems have demonstrated that the presence of NERF4 significantly enhances repair efficiency, underscoring its vital role in maintaining genomic stability. Crucially, in human dermal fibroblasts, the knockdown of NERF4 resulted in an increased sensitivity to UV-induced cytotoxicity, implicating its necessity for effective lesion recognition and excision during the NER process. Investigations exploring the upregulation of NERF4 in response to oxidative stress have also pointed to a protective role against oxidative DNA lesions, further cementing its position as a key player in the cellular defense against genotoxic insults. Understanding the specific mechanisms of action of NERF4 may also illuminate potential therapeutic strategies for diseases characterized by deficient DNA repair capabilities, including certain cancers and premature aging disorders.
