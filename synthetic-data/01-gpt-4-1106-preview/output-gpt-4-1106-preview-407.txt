prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: TOM. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we examined the role of the translocase of the outer mitochondrial membrane (TOM) complex in the cellular metabolism of Homo sapiens. The pivotal nature of the TOM complex was elucidated through a series of assays that measured its involvement in the import of cytosolically synthesized proteins into mitochondria. Disruption of TOM function via pharmacological agents led to a marked decrease in mitochondrial respiration, as evidenced by a reduction in oxygen consumption rates in isolated organelles. Furthermore, patients presenting with mitochondrial myopathy exhibited lower levels of TOM activity compared with healthy controls, suggesting a possible correlation between TOM efficiency and muscular health. Conversely, overexpression of TOM enhanced the uptake of critical substrates, implicating the complex in cellular homeostasis and stress responses. These findings open new avenues for therapeutic interventions targeting mitochondrial dysfunctions and underscore the significance of the TOM complex in maintaining cellular vitality.
