prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: collagen type III trimer. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we investigated the role of the collagen type III trimer in the progression of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), a chronic and often fatal lung disease characterized by a progressive decline in lung function. Using a murine model, we administered bleomycin to induce lung injury, mimicking the fibrotic process observed in IPF patients. Histological analysis demonstrated the increased deposition of the collagen type III trimer in the extracellular matrix of the lung tissue, suggesting a pivotal role in the fibrogenesis pathway associated with disease progression. Furthermore, mass spectrometry-based proteomic analysis revealed a significant upregulation of the collagen type III trimer post-bleomycin treatment compared to saline-treated controls, corroborating the histological findings. To assess the functional impact on lung mechanics, we performed pulmonary function tests, which indicated a marked reduction in lung compliance and increased stiffness correlating with the enhanced presence of the collagen type III trimer. The results provide compelling evidence that the collagen type III trimer contributes to the extracellular matrix remodeling characteristic of IPF and may represent a potential target for therapeutic intervention aimed at halting or reversing lung damage in affected individuals.
