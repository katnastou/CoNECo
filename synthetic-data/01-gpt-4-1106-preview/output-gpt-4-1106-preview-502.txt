prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: PstSCAB. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In a recent study examining the efflux mechanisms implicated in antibiotic resistance, the protein complex PstSCAB has been highlighted as a pivotal player in the transport of phosphates across the cellular membrane of *Escherichia coli*. Building upon existing knowledge that membrane transport systems are critical for maintaining cellular homeostasis, this research set out to determine the specific role of PstSCAB in bacterial phosphate regulation and its potential impact on the survival of bacterial cells under antibiotic stress. Methodologies utilized included targeted mutagenesis and protein assays to quantify PstSCAB activity in the presence of various antibiotics such as aminoglycosides and Î²-lactams. Results suggested a novel correlation between overexpression of PstSCAB and an increased level of antibiotic tolerance, particularly in environments with limited phosphate availability. The investigation into the three-dimensional structure of PstSCAB through cryo-electron microscopy revealed conformational alterations upon phosphate and antibiotic binding, suggesting a mechanism by which PstSCAB may be modulating the interaction between the antibiotics and their targets. In vivo assays substantiated these findings, demonstrating that disruption of PstSCAB expression rendered cells significantly more susceptible to antibiotic-induced lysis. Thus, delineating the function of PstSCAB not only contributes to our comprehension of bacterial adaptive strategies but also presents potential new targets for antimicrobial therapy, which is crucial in the face of rising antibiotic resistance.
