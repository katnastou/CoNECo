prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: TIMM23. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In the exploration of mitochondrial dynamics and its implications for the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative disorders, recent studies have unearthed pivotal insights into the role of the protein complex TIMM23. This intricate assembly is fundamental to the translocation process of precursor proteins across the mitochondrial inner membrane. Mechanistic elucidation via cross-linking assays and cryo-electron microscopy revealed that TIMM23-mediated protein import is coupled to the electrochemical potential, underscoring the essentiality of mitochondrial membrane integrity for proper function. Pharmacological perturbation of the transmembrane potential resulted in a marked decrease in import efficiency, implicating TIMM23 not only in basal mitochondrial maintenance but also in cellular responses to metabolic stress. Further investigation into the substrates processed by TIMM23 underscored its selectivity and broad engagement with proteins destined for the mitochondrial matrix. Pathologically, aberrant activity of TIMM23 has been associated with a spectrum of mitochondrial diseases, prompting the advent of targeted therapeutic interventions aiming to ameliorate protein import deficits. Thus, TIMM23 emerges not only as a critical checkpoint in mitochondrial biogenesis but also as a potential pharmacological target in the quest to treat mitochondria-related diseases.
