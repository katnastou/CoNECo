prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: ABI. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In a recent study, the role of the ABI protein complex in cellular signaling pathways associated with oncogenesis has been elucidated. The experimentation involved a systematic analysis of the interactions between the ABI complex and various intracellular signaling molecules in human carcinoma cell lines. Through the use of immunoprecipitation techniques followed by mass spectrometry, it was revealed that the ABI complex interacts preferentially with certain phosphoinositides, indicating a potential regulatory role in phospholipid signaling pathways. Moreover, knockdown experiments utilizing siRNA demonstrated that reduced expression of the ABI complex significantly impaired cell proliferation and induced apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner, suggesting its critical function in cell cycle progression and survival. This effect was particularly evident in cells exposed to therapeutic agents, such as doxorubicin, highlighting the potential of ABI as a novel target for chemotherapeutic intervention. In vivo studies conducted on murine models further supported these findings, where disruption of the ABI complex led to reduced tumor growth and enhanced sensitivity to chemotherapeutic agents, establishing a clear correlation between the ABI complex and the pathophysiology of cancer.
