prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: KEOPS/EKC. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In a recent study, the role of the KEOPS/EKC complex was investigated in relation to its contribution to tRNA modification and its subsequent impact on cellular homeostasis. The findings suggest that the KEOPS/EKC complex is integral to the maintenance of nucleotide homeostasis within Saccharomyces cerevisiae, facilitating a critical modification of tRNA molecules that is requisite for proper translation fidelity. Perturbations in the activity of KEOPS/EKC led to observable phenotypic alterations, with yeast cells exhibiting reduced growth rates and increased sensitivity to stress-inducing agents. Further biochemical assays demonstrated that the enzymatic functions of KEOPS/EKC are dependent on specific interaction with ATP molecules, highlighting the complex's requirement for energy to mediate its role in tRNA modification processes. These insights into the KEOPS/EKC complex and its mechanisms of action contribute to the broader understanding of translational regulation and its pertinence to cellular physiology, with potential implications for diseases where protein synthesis is affected, such as certain neurodegenerative disorders.
