prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: PS1. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In recent investigations into the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD), considerable attention has been drawn towards the pivotal role of the PS1 protein complex in amyloid-beta (Aβ) peptide production. AD, a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by progressive cognitive decline, has been strongly associated with the accumulation of Aβ plaques within the central nervous system. The PS1 protein complex has been implicated in the proteolytic processing of amyloid precursor protein (APP), serving as an integral component of the γ-secretase complex that catalyzes the formation of Aβ peptides of various lengths. Notably, the overproduction of the longer, more aggregation-prone Aβ42 peptide, as governed by the enzymatic action of the PS1 protein complex, has been correlated with increased plaque formation and, subsequently, neurotoxicity. The identification of selective inhibitors targeting the catalytic activity of the PS1 protein complex holds potential therapeutic value. However, the development of such compounds necessitates a comprehensive understanding of the molecular mechanisms governing PS1's interactions with APP, as well as the broader implications for cellular processing pathways and neuronal health.
