prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: CPS-A. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In the current study, we examined the role of the CPS-A protein complex in the regulation of immune response during Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection. Our methodology involved the isolation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from a cohort of individuals with latent tuberculosis and from uninfected controls. These cells were then exposed to specific antigens associated with the pathogen to simulate reactivation. Subsequent proteomic analysis indicated a significant upregulation of CPS-A in cells from the infected group post-antigen exposure, compared to the minimal changes observed in the control group. Additionally, treatment with a selective inhibitor of CPS-A resulted in a marked attenuation of the inflammatory cytokines, suggesting that CPS-A plays a pivotal role in modulating the host's immune response to Mycobacterium tuberculosis. The data infer that targeting CPS-A could potentially offer a novel therapeutic approach to managing tuberculosis by controlling the immune-mediated pathology associated with the disease, while further longitudinal studies are required to validate the long-term impacts of CPS-A inhibition on disease progression and outcome.
