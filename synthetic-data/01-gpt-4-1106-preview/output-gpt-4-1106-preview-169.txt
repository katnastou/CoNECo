prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: SAT-OASS. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In the current study, we explored the mechanistic role of the SAT-OASS protein complex in cystathionine beta-synthase (CBS) deficiency, a metabolic disorder characterized by elevated plasma homocysteine levels. The SAT-OASS complex, which is intricately involved in the biosynthesis of cysteine, catalyzes consecutive enzymatic reactions pivotal to the transsulfuration pathway. Utilizing a murine model deficient in CBS, we investigated whether overexpression of SAT-OASS could mitigate the biochemical phenotype associated with the disorder. Tissue samples from the liver and kidney, as primary sites of transsulfuration, were assayed for the presence and activity of SAT-OASS. Our findings indicate that enhanced expression of SAT-OASS in these tissues correlates with a significant reduction in homocysteine concentrations, suggesting a compensatory role for the complex in the metabolic cascade affected by CBS deficiency. These results provide a compelling rationale for further research into the therapeutic potential of SAT-OASS modulation in the treatment of hyperhomocysteinemia and related cardiovascular pathologies.
