prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: CBM. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In the quest to delineate the molecular underpinnings of innate immune signaling pathways, the CBM complex has emerged as a crucial mediator in orchestrating the cellular response to various pathogens. Recent investigations have revealed that upon engagement with pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs), CBM initiates a signaling cascade that culminates in the transcriptional activation of genes responsible for inflammatory cytokine production. Notably, this complex's role has been implicated in the host defense mechanism against a diverse array of microorganisms, including bacteria and viruses. Furthermore, dysregulation of CBM function has been associated with the pathogenesis of inflammatory disorders, where aberrant activation leads to excessive cytokine secretion, thereby contributing to tissue damage and disease progression. To further elucidate CBM's regulatory mechanisms, both in vitro and in vivo studies using murine models have been employed. These studies aim to provide insights that could pave the way for the development of targeted therapeutic interventions aimed at modulating its activity in diseases where its signaling pathway is implicated.
