prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: SAS-I. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In the present study, we sought to explore the functional role of the SAS-I complex in cellular senescence pathways. Previous research has suggested a correlation between the dysregulation of such protein complexes and the onset of age-associated diseases. To elucidate this relationship, we conducted an array of in vitro assays using human fibroblast cultures treated with hydrogen peroxide, a known inducer of oxidative stress. We observed that cells with compromised SAS-I activity exhibited an accelerated rate of senescence, as evidenced by an increase in senescence-associated beta-galactosidase activity. Moreover, parallel experiments demonstrated that these cells had a reduced capacity to repair DNA damage, particularly double-strand breaks, which are highly detrimental to genomic integrity. Additionally, transcriptome analysis revealed a downregulation of autophagy-related genes in the absence of functional SAS-I, suggesting a possible mechanism by which SAS-I may influence the senescence phenotype. This impairment was also evident in our murine model, where we noted an increased susceptibility to early-onset phenotypes that resemble premature aging in organisms with a compromised SAS-I complex. Collectively, these findings implicate the SAS-I complex as a critical modulator of cellular longevity and stress response mechanisms, potentially offering a target for therapeutic intervention in age-related pathologies.
