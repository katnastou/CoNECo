prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: TRAMP4. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: Recent advancements in the understanding of RNA surveillance mechanisms have delineated an imperative role for the TRAMP4 complex in the modulation of non-coding RNA (ncRNA) metabolism within eukaryotic cells. This study focuses on delineating the structural functionality of TRAMP4, investigating its interaction with the exosome, a ribonucleolytic multi-protein complex responsible for RNA decay, within the milieu of the cell nucleus. Through a series of in vitro assays complemented with in vivo examination in Saccharomyces cerevisiae models, we discerned that the TRAMP4 complex actively participates in the recognition and processing of aberrant ncRNAs, marking them for degradation. Notably, the perturbation of TRAMP4 expression significantly impacted cellular homeostasis, leading to an accumulation of ncRNA transcripts, implicating a potential dysregulation in RNA-mediated cellular processes. Such aberrations were notably parallel with the pathogenesis observed in neurological disorders such as Huntington's disease, thus suggesting a linkage between TRAMP4 activity and RNA-mediated neuropathologies. Our findings propose that pharmacological modulation of TRAMP4 may constitute a novel therapeutic avenue for addressing ncRNA-related dysfunctions and underscore the need for further investigation into small-molecule modulators that can selectively target this complex to ameliorate disease phenotypes.
