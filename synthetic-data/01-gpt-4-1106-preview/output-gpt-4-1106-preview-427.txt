prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: GMPR1. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we aimed to elucidate the role of Guanosine Monophosphate Reductase 1 (GMPR1) in cellular metabolism and its potential implications in oncogenesis. The activity of GMPR1 in catalyzing the irreversible deamination of GMP to IMP suggests a pivotally-regulatory position in the purine nucleotide cycle, which is critical for the synthesis of nucleic acids. We conducted an in vitro analysis using human cell lines to assess the impact of GMPR1 on the proliferation rates under varying concentrations of growth media. Moreover, we investigated the response of GMPR1 expression in cells exposed to oxidative stress, a condition known to induce DNA damage and influence metabolic pathways. Our research explored the hypothesis that aberrant regulation of GMPR1 could manifest in abnormal nucleotide levels, potentially leading to tumor progression and malignancy in mammals. To assess the clinical relevance of our findings, we reviewed a series of human biopsies from patients diagnosed with liver carcinoma, measuring GMPR1 activity in comparison to healthy hepatic tissue. The resulting data began to clarify the contributions of GMPR1 to cellular homeostasis and provide valuable insights into novel therapeutic targets for intervention in metabolic disorders of tumorigenic origin.
