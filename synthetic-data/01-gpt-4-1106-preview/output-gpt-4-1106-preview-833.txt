prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: 5HT3 receptor. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In a recent study published in the *Journal of Molecular Pharmacology*, we explored the role of the 5HT3 receptor in the pathogenesis of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). This research involved a comprehensive analysis of the receptor's expression in intestinal biopsy samples from both IBS patients and healthy controls. The 5HT3 receptor, a ligand-gated ion channel, has been implicated in the modulation of gastrointestinal motility and secretion. Utilizing immunohistochemistry and quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) techniques, we observed a statistically significant upregulation of the 5HT3 receptor in the enteric neurons of IBS subjects compared with controls. Subsequent in vitro assays using specific antagonists revealed that blockade of the 5HT3 receptor led to a marked decrease in colonic transit time, suggesting a key role for this receptor in the dysregulation of bowel motility characteristic of IBS. Furthermore, our investigation included a trial with a cohort of IBS patients administering a selective 5HT3 receptor antagonist, which resulted in clinically relevant symptom relief. These findings underscore the potential therapeutic benefit of targeting the 5HT3 receptor in the management of IBS, warranting further clinical trials to optimize treatment strategies.
