prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: Hydrogenase 4. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In the recent study by Smith et al., 2023, the enzymatic capabilities of Hydrogenase 4 have been characterized in the context of anaerobic energy metabolism in Escherichia coli. The researchers observed that in the absence of external electron acceptors, the activity of Hydrogenase 4 plays a pivotal role in maintaining cellular redox balance. Notably, the use of selective inhibitors allowed for the dissection of Hydrogenase 4's influence on the metabolic flux between fermentation and the respiratory chain. Quantitative proteomics confirmed the upregulation of Hydrogenase 4 under microaerobic conditions, suggesting an adaptive response to oxidative stress. Furthermore, phenotypic analyses of mutant strains deficient in Hydrogenase 4 activity revealed a marked decrease in growth rate when exposed to the reactive oxygen species hydrogen peroxide, implying a protective role against oxidative damage. The findings presented elevate the understanding of Hydrogenase 4 function and lay the foundation for future investigations into its therapeutic potential for the treatment of metabolic disorders involving redox imbalances.
