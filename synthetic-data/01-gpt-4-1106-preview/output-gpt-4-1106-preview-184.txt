prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: GARP. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In a recent study published in the *Journal of Molecular Medicine*, the Golgi-associated retrograde protein (GARP) complex has been implicated in the selective transport and localization of certain cellular enzymes, highlighting its critical role in maintaining lysosomal function and integrity. Through a series of in vitro biochemical assays and in vivo experiments using genetically modified murine models, researchers observed that disruptions in the GARP complex led to perturbations in the trafficking pathway of lysosomal hydrolases, resulting in lysosomal storage disorders (LSDs). The study provides compelling evidence that the GARP complex is essential for the recycling of hydrolases, and defects in this pathway precipitate a cascade of cellular dysfunctions. Pharmacological modulation of GARP-related pathways could offer a potential therapeutic strategy for LSDs. Interestingly, the role of GARP extends beyond traditional endosomal-lysosomal trafficking and may encompass broader aspects of cellular homeostasis, as evidenced by altered lipid metabolism and increased oxidative stress in cells deficient in the GARP complex. Thus, GARP represents a novel target for the development of therapies aimed at treating metabolic disorders and diseases characterized by defective cellular waste management.
