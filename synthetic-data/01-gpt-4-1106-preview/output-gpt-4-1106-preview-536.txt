prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: GPIT. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: Recent developments in the study of signal transduction pathways have elucidated the pivotal role of the glycosylphosphatidylinositol transamidase (GPIT) complex in the post-translational modification of proteins in Homo sapiens. In particular, this complex has been observed to facilitate the attachment of glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchors to the C-terminus of select proteins, thereby mediating their anchorage to the cellular membrane. Our investigation aimed to discern the functional implications of the GPIT complex within the pathogenesis of lipid storage disorders. Utilizing CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing techniques in murine models, and subsequent lipidomics analysis, we observed an aberration in the sphingolipid and phospholipid profiles in subjects deficient in GPIT, indicating its potential regulatory role in lipid metabolism. Moreover, in vitro assays in human cell lines further substantiated the hypothesis that GPIT indirectly influences the activity of phospholipase C, which is a key player in lipid signal transduction. Subsequent studies are warranted to delineate the precise mechanism by which the GPIT complex interacts with other cellular components, and its potential as a therapeutic target in the treatment of lipid-associated pathologies. The implications of GPIT functionality in metabolic regulation highlight a broader scope of intracellular interactions influencing cell physiology, with ramifications for the understanding and management of metabolic diseases.
