prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: SufE. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The recent investigation into the biochemical pathways involved in the cellular response to oxidative stress has highlighted the significance of the protein complex SufE. The research, drawing from a multitude of cell cultures, pointed to a noteworthy upregulation of SufE in response to elevated levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS). This upregulation suggests a potential protective role for this protein complex within the cellular antioxidative defense mechanism. In vitro assays involving isolated mitochondrial fractions revealed that SufE demonstrates a binding affinity for superoxide dismutase (SOD), an enzyme integral to the dismutation of superoxide radicals. Furthermore, cells with higher expression levels of SufE exhibited a marked decrease in biomarkers indicative of oxidative damage, such as lipid peroxides and 8-oxo-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-oxo-dG), particularly under conditions of oxidative stress induced by hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) exposure. Murine models deficient in SufE manifested an increased susceptibility to stress-induced diseases such as hepatocellular carcinoma, further emphasizing the importance of SufE in maintaining cellular redox homeostasis. Thus, SufE appears to play a critical role in cellular defensive strategies against oxidative damage, potentially offering a novel target for therapeutic intervention in the treatment of diseases where oxidative stress is a contributory factor.
