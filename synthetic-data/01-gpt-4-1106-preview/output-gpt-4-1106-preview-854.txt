prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: BRISC. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In a recent study focusing on the modulation of innate immunity, the protein complex BRISC has been implicated as a critical regulator of cytokine production in response to viral infections. The investigation employed a combination of biochemical assays and cellular analyses to delineate the role of BRISC in the signaling pathways leading to the synthesis of type I interferons. Upon infection with the influenza A virus in murine models, a marked elevation in BRISC activity was observed, correlating with an enhanced interferon response. Remarkably, subsequent in vitro experiments using human-derived macrophages demonstrated that treatment with the small molecule inhibitor bortezomib notably reduced the activity of BRISC, resulting in a concomitant decrease in the expression of interferon-stimulated genes. This suggests that BRISC may serve as a potential therapeutic target for modulating immune responses in viral diseases. Moreover, BRISC's involvement in the degradation of ubiquitinated proteins underscores its broader significance in cellular protein homeostasis, with implications extending to disorders characterized by dysregulated protein turnover.
