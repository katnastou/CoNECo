prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: CFIIm. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: Recent investigations into the transcriptional regulation mechanisms within eukaryotic cells have illuminated the pivotal role of the CFIIm protein complex in RNA polymerase II-mediated elongation. The precise contributions of CFIIm in the context of mRNA stabilization and processing have become areas of intense scrutiny. In a series of in vitro assays utilizing murine embryonic stem cell extracts, we observed that the presence of CFIIm significantly enhanced the efficiency of polyadenylation, a critical post-transcriptional modification that confers mRNA stability and export competency. Intriguingly, upon pharmacological inhibition of cyclin-dependent kinases, CFIIm's influence on the polyadenylation process was markedly diminished, suggesting a regulatory interplay that may be phosphorylation-dependent. Further, it was demonstrated that in cells subject to oxidative stress, the recruitment of CFIIm to the transcriptional machinery exhibited a noticeable decrease, correlating with an overall reduction in transcript stability. These findings implicate CFIIm as a crucial modulator of transcript integrity, with potential implications for understanding diseases characterized by dysregulation of mRNA processing, such as certain myopathies and neurodegenerative disorders. Future research will aim to elucidate the structural basis of CFIIm's function and its regulation under physiological and pathophysiological conditions, thus potentially unveiling novel therapeutic targets.
