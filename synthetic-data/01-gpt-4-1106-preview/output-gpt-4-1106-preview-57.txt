prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: cytochrome bc1. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In the present study, we sought to elucidate the regulatory mechanisms governing cellular energy production, with a specific focus on the role of the cytochrome bc1 complex in mitochondrial electron transport chain function. The cytochrome bc1 complex is a critical component in the process of oxidative phosphorylation, serving as a pivotal point for electron transfer between ubiquinone and cytochrome c while simultaneously translocating protons across the mitochondrial membrane to generate a proton gradient. Our investigations employed a combination of fluorescent probes and respirometry to analyze the activity of the cytochrome bc1 complex in isolated mitochondria from murine cardiac tissue. Notably, upon exposure to increasing concentrations of the antifungal agent amphotericin B, a decline in ATP synthesis was observed, which may be attributed to the disruption of cytochrome bc1 complex function. This impairment suggests a potential for off-target drug effects leading to mitochondrial dysfunction, a condition implicated in a wide range of diseases, including cardiomyopathies and metabolic disorders. These findings underscore the essential nature of the cytochrome bc1 complex in maintaining cellular bioenergetics and highlight the delicate balance that exists within mitochondrial processes.
