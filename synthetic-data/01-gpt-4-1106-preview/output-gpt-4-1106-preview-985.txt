prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: COMPASSs. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In a groundbreaking study recently published, the intricate role of the COMPASSs complex has been elucidated in the context of chromatin remodeling and its subsequent impact on gene expression regulation. Notably, the COMPASSs complex has a pivotal function in methylating specific histones, which in turn modulates the accessibility of transcriptional machinery to DNA. This research utilized a sophisticated in vivo model system to observe the dynamics of COMPASSs-mediated methylation and its effects on cellular differentiation pathways. Interestingly, when the activity of the COMPASSs complex was inhibited pharmacologically, there was a marked increase in the expression of genes associated with the pathogenesis of glioblastoma, indicating a potential therapeutic target. This discovery opens new vistas for the intervention in diseases where epigenetic dysregulation is a contributing factor. Furthermore, the implications of this work suggest that modulating the activity of COMPASSs could be a substantial leap forward in developing more refined strategies for the treatment of various malignancies. Detailed biochemical assays have confirmed the specificity of COMPASSs for histone substrates, thereby solidifying the foundational understanding of the regulatory mechanisms underpinning chromatin dynamics and gene expression control.
