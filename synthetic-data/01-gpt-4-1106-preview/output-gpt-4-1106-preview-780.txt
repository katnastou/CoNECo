prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: RNA polymerase III. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In recent studies, the essential role of RNA polymerase III in cellular function has been increasingly highlighted, particularly in the context of its involvement in the transcription of small RNA molecules, which are imperative for the proper maintenance of protein synthesis within the cell. Aberrations in the activity of RNA polymerase III have been implicated in the pathogenesis of a variety of human diseases, notably those related to disruptions in the regulatory mechanisms of cell growth and proliferation. For instance, investigations have revealed that in certain cases of cancer, the dysregulation of RNA polymerase III activity can lead to an increased transcription of small RNAs, which could potentially contribute to the oncogenic phenotype. In contrast, organisms subjected to caloric restriction have demonstrated a decrease in RNA polymerase III activity, which correlates with increased lifespanâ€”an observation suggesting a complex interplay between metabolic states and transcriptional control. The intricate balance maintained by RNA polymerase III is thus not only fundamental to the basic cellular processes but also to the understanding of its broader implications in disease states, which may lead to potential therapeutic interventions targeting its regulatory mechanisms.
