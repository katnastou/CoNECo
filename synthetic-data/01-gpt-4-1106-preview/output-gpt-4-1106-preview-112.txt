prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: MKS. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we aimed to elucidate the role of MKS in the pathology of autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease (ARPKD), a severe monogenic disorder affecting renal and hepatic function. The cellular experiments were conducted using human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK293) cells, which were chosen for their high transfection efficiency and robustness in protein expression studies. Upon exposure to deleterious conditions, cells expressing MKS exhibited a marked increase in apoptosis, as evidenced by flow cytometry analysis using Annexin V and propidium iodide staining. This pro-apoptotic effect was further corroborated by an upregulation of caspase-3 activity in the cell lysates, quantified through a colorimetric assay. Co-treatment with a broad-spectrum caspase inhibitor notably reduced cell death, suggesting that MKS may play a significant role in the apoptotic pathway. Furthermore, to examine whether oxidative stress contributed to MKS function, cells were treated with hydrogen peroxide (H2O2); we observed an enhanced susceptibility to oxidative damage in cells overexpressing MKS compared to controls. Taken together, these findings implicate MKS in the cellular mechanisms underlying ARPKD by promoting apoptosis in renal cells, potentially offering a new target for therapeutic intervention.
