prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: AP-2 adaptor. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In a recent study published in the Journal of Cellular Biochemistry, researchers investigated the role of the AP-2 adaptor protein complex in clathrin-mediated endocytosis and its implications for cholesterol homeostasis. The research team utilized a combination of fluorescence microscopy and biochemical assays to delineate the AP-2 adaptor's function in the internalization of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) particles, a key process in the maintenance of plasma cholesterol levels. Primary fibroblasts isolated from patients with familial hypercholesterolemia demonstrated a marked reduction in LDL uptake when the activity of the AP-2 adaptor was inhibited, highlighting its critical role in receptor-mediated endocytosis. Furthermore, the study demonstrated that disruption of AP-2 adaptor-mediated trafficking pathways could contribute to the pathogenesis of atherosclerotic lesions, emphasizing the potential of targeting this protein complex in the treatment of cardiovascular diseases. Pharmacological agents that modulate the function of the AP-2 adaptor represent a novel therapeutic avenue, which may offer a targeted approach to prevent the progression of atherosclerosis in affected patient populations.
