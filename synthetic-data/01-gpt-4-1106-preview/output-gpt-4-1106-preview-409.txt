prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: BORC. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we investigated the regulatory role of BORC in autophagy, a critical cellular process for the degradation and recycling of cytoplasmic components. Emerging evidence suggests that BORC is intricately involved in modulating the spatial coordination of autophagosome formation. Utilizing murine models and primary fibroblast cultures, we explored the influence of BORC on autophagic flux under both nutrient-rich and starvation-induced conditions. The administration of the lysosomal inhibitor, chloroquine, allowed for the assessment of autophagosome accumulation, revealing that cells deficient in BORC exhibited a marked decrease in LC3-II levels compared to controls. This reduction implicates BORC as a facilitator of autophagosome-lysosome fusion. Moreover, the perturbation of BORC function resulted in altered cellular responses to metabolic stress, suggesting a possible link between BORC-mediated autophagy and the pathophysiology of metabolic disorders. Our findings provide new insights into the molecular machinery of autophagy and elucidate potential therapeutic targets for diseases where dysfunctional autophagy is implicated.
