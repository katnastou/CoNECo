prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: surface IgG2a. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In the present study, we aimed to elucidate the role of surface IgG2a in regulating immune responses during pathogenic invasion in a murine model. Surface IgG2a was found to be predominantly expressed on the B cells within germinal centers of the spleen. Following inoculation with Listeria monocytogenes, mice exhibited an enhanced immunological reaction characterized by increased cytokine production, predominantly interferon-gamma (IFN-Î³) and interleukin-4 (IL-4), in conjunction with a more robust recruitment of CD8+ T cells to the infection site. Histological analysis revealed that the density of surface IgG2a-expressing B cells was positively correlated with the size of the germinal centers and the magnitude of the subsequent immune responses. Furthermore, employing a neutralizing antibody against surface IgG2a resulted in a marked reduction in B cell proliferation and antibody secretion, suggesting a critical involvement of this complex in the humoral immune response. These findings highlight the potential of targeting surface IgG2a in therapeutic strategies designed to modulate B cell activity in diseases characterized by either suboptimal or aberrant immune responses.
