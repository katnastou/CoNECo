prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: RPA. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we investigated the role of the replication protein A (RPA) complex in the cellular response to DNA damage induced by the chemotherapeutic agent doxorubicin in human fibroblasts. RPA, pivotal for DNA replication and repair processes, is hypothesized to contribute to the maintenance of genomic stability in the face of genotoxic stress. Cells were exposed to escalating concentrations of doxorubicin to induce double-strand breaks (DSBs) and subsequently assessed for RPA foci formation through immunofluorescence microscopy. It was observed that RPA quickly localized to sites of DNA damage, peaking in intensity at 1 hour post-treatment and correlating with the activation of the DNA damage response (DDR) pathways. Additionally, pharmacological inhibition of RPA function using small molecule inhibitors led to a pronounced accumulation of DSBs, as evidenced by Î³-H2AX foci quantification, suggesting that RPA plays a critical role in the repair of doxorubicin-induced DNA lesions. The cell viability assays post-doxorubicin exposure underscored the protective function of RPA against drug-induced cytotoxicity. Altogether, the findings propound that RPA not only is integral to DNA replication but also serves as a sentinel in the DDR machinery that safeguards the cell during chemotherapeutic interventions.
