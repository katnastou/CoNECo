prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: CUE1-UBC7 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (E2). Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In exploring the intricate cellular pathways related to protein degradation, the CUE1-UBC7 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (E2) plays a pivotal role in the ubiquitin-proteasome system, a critical mechanism for maintaining cellular homeostasis. The present study aimed to examine the function of the CUE1-UBC7 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme complex in the context of endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation (ERAD) in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, often utilized as a model organism for eukaryotic cell research. Our experiments involved the overexpression of CUE1-UBC7 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme in yeast cells under conditions of induced ER stress by tunicamycin, a glycosylation inhibitor known to induce misfolded protein accumulation. Through immunoprecipitation assays followed by quantitative mass spectrometry, we were able to observe a marked increase in ubiquitination levels of ER-localized substrates, suggesting an enhancement in ERAD efficiency. Moreover, cells displaying elevated activity of CUE1-UBC7 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme exhibited increased resistance to ER stress-induced apoptosis, compared to the wild-type control. This finding underscores the potential therapeutic importance of modulating the activity of the CUE1-UBC7 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme complex in the treatment of diseases characterized by ER stress and protein misfolding, such as Alzheimer's disease and cystic fibrosis. Further investigation into the regulatory mechanisms governing this enzyme complex may provide insights into novel approaches for modulating proteostasis in human cells.
