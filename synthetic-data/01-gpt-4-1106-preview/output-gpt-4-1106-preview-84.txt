prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: Hpa3. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In recent studies, the protein complex Hpa3 has garnered attention for its potential role in the modulation of cellular response mechanisms against oxidative stress. The evidence suggests that the complex could be integral to the maintenance of redox homeostasis within certain eukaryotic cells. In vivo experiments, using a murine model, demonstrated an upregulation of Hpa3 in response to systemic administration of hydrogen peroxide, a reactive oxygen species (ROS) commonly implicated in oxidative stress-related cellular damage. Moreover, follow-up in vitro assays have highlighted that the presence of Hpa3 is associated with a marked decrease in lipid peroxidation and protein carbonylation levels, which are widely recognized biomarkers of oxidative cell injury. The mechanisms by which Hpa3 exerts a protective effect against ROS are currently under investigation; however, preliminary data suggest that it may be involved in the activation of key signaling pathways responsible for the induction of cellular antioxidant defenses. The therapeutic applications of these findings are immense, especially in diseases where oxidative stress is a known exacerbating factor, such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and certain types of cancer, where managing oxidative balance is crucial for disease management and mitigation of progression.
