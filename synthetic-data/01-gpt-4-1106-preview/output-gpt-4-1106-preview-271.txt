prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: SWItch/Sucrose Non-Fermentable. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: Recent studies have focused on elucidating the role of chromatin remodeling in the context of neurodegenerative diseases, paying particularly close attention to the SWItch/Sucrose Non-Fermentable complex and its impact on neuronal gene expression patterns. Chromatin's dynamic nature, driven by such protein complexes, is pivotal in the epigenetic regulation of synaptic development and function. In a noteworthy experiment, murine models with induced Alzheimer's disease displayed altered chromatin landscapes, prompting an investigation into the potential involvement of the SWItch/Sucrose Non-Fermentable complex in the pathogenesis of this condition. By employing advanced chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by high-throughput sequencing (ChIP-seq), the study revealed significant changes in nucleosome positioning at key regulatory regions of genes implicated in synaptic plasticity and neuronal survival. These findings suggest that interactions between the SWItch/Sucrose Non-Fermentable complex and epigenetic modifiers may influence neural circuitry and contribute to the cognitive deficits observed in Alzheimer's disease. Thus, targeted modulation of this protein complex appears as a promising avenue for therapeutic intervention, although further investigation is required to elucidate the precise molecular mechanisms governing its activity in neurons.
