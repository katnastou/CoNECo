prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: RZZ. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In the intricate choreography of chromosome segregation during mitosis, the regulation of kinetochore-microtubule attachments is critical for accurate chromosomal alignment and distribution. A pivotal player in this process, the RZZ complex, has been observed to perform essential functions in the spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC), a surveillance mechanism that ensures proper kinetochore-microtubule interactions. Recent studies employing cryo-electron microscopy elucidated RZZ's architectural conformation, revealing a dynamic scaffold capable of recruiting SAC components, thereby halting anaphase onset in the presence of unattached kinetochores. Furthermore, pharmacological intervention using microtubule-perturbing agents, such as taxol and nocodazole, has substantiated the role of RZZ as a sensor of spindle integrity. In pathological contexts, dysfunction in RZZ-mediated checkpoints has been implicated in the etiology of aneuploidy, consequently contributing to tumorigenesis in several cancer models. Thus, delineating the molecular operations of the RZZ complex remains a focal point for therapeutic strategies aiming to modulate mitotic fidelity in disease states.
