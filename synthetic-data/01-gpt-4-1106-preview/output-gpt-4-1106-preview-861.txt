prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: Shu. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In recent years, the protein complex Shu has emerged as a critical player in the maintenance of genomic stability. This complex is known to facilitate the error-free repair of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) through the homologous recombination (HR) pathway. In an experimental study conducted on Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the proficiency of Shu in Rad51 filament stabilization was demonstrated to be indispensable for the repair of DSBs induced by ionizing radiation or mutagenic agents such as methyl methanesulfonate (MMS). Additionally, the absence of the protein complex Shu has been associated with heightened sensitivity to these DNA-damaging agents. Furthermore, investigations utilizing cell cycle arrest have elucidated that Shu's mechanism of action is temporally regulated, showcasing significant activity during the S and G2 phases when the sister chromatid is available as a template for HR. The elucidation of Shu's function provides valuable insight into therapeutic strategies aimed at ameliorating the impact of genomic instability in various diseases, including cancer, where defective DNA damage response mechanisms are a hallmark. Understanding the dynamics of the Shu complex could potentially inform the development of novel pharmacological agents aimed at enhancing DNA repair pathways in disease-affected cells, thereby improving patient outcomes.
