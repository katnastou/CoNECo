prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: 5HT3A-R. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The present study aimed to elucidate the modulatory effects of a novel compound, ZYX-123, on the function of the 5HT3A-R in murine models. Intriguingly, ZYX-123 demonstrated a high affinity for the 5HT3A-R, which is a prominent receptor implicated in the regulation of various physiological processes, including gastrointestinal motility and central nervous system signaling. Upon administration, ZYX-123 was observed to induce a dose-dependent alteration in receptor activity, which could be quantified using whole-cell patch-clamp electrophysiology. Notably, at concentrations of 10 ÂµM and higher, ZYX-123 resulted in a significant decrease in the peak current amplitude mediated by 5HT3A-R, suggesting an inhibitory action. To assess the potential therapeutic implications of these findings, the compound's effects were further examined in the context of an induced irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) model. Here, ZYX-123-treated mice exhibited a marked alleviation of disease symptoms as compared to the control cohort, indicating that modulation of 5HT3A-R activity by this compound may represent a novel therapeutic avenue for the treatment of IBS and related gastrointestinal disturbances. These results underscore the need for further investigation to fully characterize the binding kinetics and downstream signaling implications of ZYX-123 interaction with 5HT3A-R in various physiological and pathological settings.
