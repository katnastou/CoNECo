prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: Gin4. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In a recent endeavor aimed at elucidating the role of key regulatory elements within the intricate landscape of cellular division, we directed our investigation towards the functional characterization of the protein complex Gin4. Employing both *Saccharomyces cerevisiae* as a model organism and a suite of biochemical assays, we observed that the presence of Gin4 is crucial for maintaining cell wall integrity during cytokinesis. Notably, the administration of caspofungin, an echinocandin-class antifungal agent known to perturb Î²-glucan synthesis, resulted in pronounced cell wall stress in the yeast cells, which was markedly exacerbated in the absence of Gin4. Moreover, our results indicate that Gin4 may interact with downstream effectors involved in the mitotic exit network, suggesting a role beyond structural support, intertwining with signal transduction pathways critical for cell cycle progression. Investigations using targeted proteomics further revealed that the phosphorylation status of Gin4 changed dynamically in response to cell cycle cues and external stressors, indicative of a complex regulatory mechanism. Our findings imply that Gin4 operates at a nexus of pathways essential for cellular homeostasis, presenting a potential target for antifungal drug development aimed at combating resistance mechanisms often observed in clinically relevant fungal pathogens.
