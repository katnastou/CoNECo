prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: inhibin B. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In the recent study published in the *Journal of Reproductive Endocrinology and Metabolism*, the research team focused on the regulatory role of inhibin B in ovarian physiology. The investigation, which encompassed both in vitro and in vivo analyses, aimed at elucidating the complex interactions between inhibin B and various signaling pathways in the context of follicular development. The findings revealed that levels of inhibin B are critically modulated in response to gonadotropins and that this modulation has profound effects on the estrous cycle. Through a series of elegantly designed experiments, the research provided evidence that dysregulation of inhibin B is associated with the onset of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), suggesting a potential therapeutic target for this pervasive reproductive disorder. Moreover, the study investigated the cross-talk between inhibin B and insulin in murine models, uncovering novel insights into the multifaceted role of inhibin B in metabolic-reproductive axis interplay, which could have implications for understanding insulin resistance phenomena observed in PCOS patients. Importantly, this body of work underscores the necessity for further exploration into the mechanisms by which inhibin B modulates ovarian function, which could unlock new avenues for fertility treatments and hormonal therapies.
