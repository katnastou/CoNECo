prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: M-calpain. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In the study herein, we explored the regulatory mechanisms that modulate the activity of M-calpain in the context of neurodegenerative diseases. M-calpain, a calcium-dependent cysteine protease, has been implicated in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease due to its role in the degradation of key cytoskeletal proteins and neuronal cell death. In vitro assays were conducted to examine the enzyme's activity in the presence of various calcium concentrations, unveiling an intricate relationship between calcium homeostasis and the proteolytic function of M-calpain. Furthermore, the administration of calpain inhibitors in murine models demonstrated a significant reduction in the progression of neurodegeneration, suggesting a therapeutic potential for modulating M-calpain activity. Immunohistochemistry of brain tissue sections revealed an increased presence of M-calpain in affected neural regions, correlating with elevated levels of apoptotic markers. Our findings elucidate the pivotal contribution of this protease to the cellular events that culminate in the hallmark pathologies observed in patients afflicted with Alzheimer's disease, providing insight into novel interventional strategies that may curb the deleterious effects triggered by the dysregulation of M-calpain activity.
