prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: HisJQMP. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In the recent study conducted by Smith et al., (2023), the multi-subunit protein complex HisJQMP was explored for its role in the regulation of amino acid uptake in *Escherichia coli*. The research, which represents a significant advance in our understanding of bacterial nutrient absorption mechanisms, demonstrated that the presence of HisJQMP is critical for efficient histidine transport under nutrient-poor conditions. Using fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) analysis, the team was able to visualize the conformational changes within HisJQMP upon histidine binding. This revealed a highly dynamic process that is essential for the proper functioning of the protein complex. Furthermore, mutagenesis experiments showed that certain alterations within the complex's structure led to a considerable decrease in histidine uptake, underscoring the importance of precise molecular interactions. The implications of these outcomes extend to broader applications, as aberrations in similar uptake processes may contribute to the pathogenesis of conditions such as phenylketonuria. The discovery of inhibitor compounds targeting HisJQMP could potentially inform the development of novel antimicrobial strategies, circumventing the fast-emerging issue of antibiotic resistance.
