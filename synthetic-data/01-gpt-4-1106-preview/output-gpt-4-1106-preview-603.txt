prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: MTREC. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In recent studies, the MTREC complex has garnered significant attention for its possible therapeutic implications. In particular, the investigation into the mechanisms of RNA processing and surveillance pathways has revealed that dysregulation of MTREC is correlated with an increased susceptibility to certain neurodegenerative disorders. Efforts to delineate the regulatory role of MTREC in the context of neural cells have unveiled its integral participation in the maturation of non-coding RNAs, a process crucial for maintaining cellular homeostasis. Inhibition assays using small molecules have demonstrated that targeted modulation of MTREC can influence the neural transcriptome, suggesting a potential pathway for the development of pharmacological interventions. Moreover, the exploration of MTREC's interaction with cellular stress responses in Saccharomyces cerevisiae has provided a foundational understanding that could translate to therapeutic strategies in human patients. While the MTREC complex offers a promising horizon in biomedical research, its multifaceted nature necessitates further investigation into its structure-function relationships and its broader impact on cellular physiology within the context of various diseases.
