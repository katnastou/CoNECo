prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: DASH. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In the pursuit of elucidating the mechanisms underlying chromosomal segregation during mitosis, recent studies have shed light on the role of the DASH protein complex and its regulatory functions. The architectural integrity of DASH is critical for its interaction with spindle microtubules, ensuring the accurate transmission of chromosomes to daughter cells. Misregulation of DASH has been implicated in a multitude of chromosomal instability phenotypes, often observed in various carcinomas. Evidence from in vitro studies demonstrates that when DASH is pharmacologically inhibited, there is a notable increase in mitotic errors, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target. However, treatment strategies involving DASH inhibition must be approached with caution due to its fundamental role in cell division and the potential for off-target effects. Model organisms such as Saccharomyces cerevisiae have been instrumental in dissecting the functions of DASH, offering insights into evolutionary conservation and providing a framework for understanding its operation in more complex eukaryotes. Moreover, research on the interplay between DASH and key mitotic regulators, such as cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs), suggests a tightly regulated temporal sequence of events: DASH localization to kinetochores coincides with specific phosphorylation states that dictate its function in attachments to microtubules. Consequently, the continuing investigation into the DASH protein complex is vital for unraveling the sophisticated narrative of cell division and its implications for human disease pathology.
