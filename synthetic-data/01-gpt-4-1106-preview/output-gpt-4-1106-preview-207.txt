prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: ESCRT II. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In the recent study published in the Journal of Cell Biology, we have meticulously characterized the role of ESCRT II in the endosomal sorting process crucial for the degradation of ubiquitinated membrane proteins. Independent experiments utilizing immunofluorescence microscopy have shown the presence of ESCRT II on the cytosolic face of late endosomes, implying a direct involvement in membrane remodeling events. Intriguingly, knockdown experiments in mammalian cells, where ESCRT II expression was suppressed via siRNA, resulted in the accumulation of ubiquitinated cargo within endosomal compartments. This aberration led to defects in endosome maturation and pronounced disruptions in lysosomal trafficking pathways. Moreover, our data suggest that through its concerted action, ESCRT II plays a non-redundant role in the endosomal-lysosomal system, which could be of paramount significance in the pathogenesis of lysosomal storage disorders. Of particular interest is the association of ESCRT II dysregulation with the progression of neurodegenerative diseases, further emphasizing the necessity to fully elucidate the molecular mechanisms underpinning its function. This study not only expands the body of knowledge surrounding ESCRT II but also presents potential therapeutic targets for the modulation of endosomal sorting in disease states.
