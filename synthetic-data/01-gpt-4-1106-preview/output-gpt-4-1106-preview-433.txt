prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: VHL. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The von Hippel-Lindau tumor suppressor protein (VHL) plays a critical role in the regulation of cellular responses to hypoxia. Recent studies have illuminated its function in targeting hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) for proteasomal degradation under normoxic conditions. In the absence of VHL, HIF is stabilized, leading to the transcriptional activation of several genes involved in angiogenesis, cell proliferation, and glucose metabolismâ€”pathways markedly implicated in cancer progression. This study aimed to delineate the molecular mechanisms of VHL-mediated HIF regulation and its impact on tumorigenesis. Our in vitro analysis using human renal carcinoma cell lines revealed that loss of VHL function causes aberrant activation of HIF, confirming the critical tumor suppressive role of VHL. Furthermore, pharmacological interventions that restore VHL activity might have therapeutic potential. In vivo experiments using murine models indicated that re-establishment of VHL function hampers tumor growth and enhances survival, suggesting its pivotal role in the cellular adaptation to oxygen availability. The relationship between VHL dysfunction and the development of clear cell renal carcinoma underscores the importance of elucidating the precise molecular pathways governed by VHL, which could unveil novel targets for therapeutic intervention.
