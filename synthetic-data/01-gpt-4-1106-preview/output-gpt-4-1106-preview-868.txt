prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: PFDL modules. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In a recent study, we have elucidated the role of PFDL modules within the cellular framework, particularly concerning their interaction with molecular chaperones during the protein folding process. The investigation was conducted on a mammalian model, in which cells were subjected to various environmental stressors known to induce protein misfolding. The PFDL modules were observed through immunoprecipitation techniques followed by mass spectrometric analysis. Results indicate that these complexes may play a pivotal role in maintaining proteostasis, especially under conditions that could potentially lead to diseases caused by protein aggregation, such as Alzheimer's disease and Huntington's disease. Additionally, the study explored the mechanism of ATP hydrolysis in facilitating the PFDL modules' function, highlighting the ATP-dependent conformational changes required for their activity. The research provides valuable insights into the potential therapeutic targeting of PFDL modules to mitigate the effects of proteopathies, implying a novel approach to treatment strategies targeting the cellular stress response.
