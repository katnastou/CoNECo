prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: intraflagellar transport complex B. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: Recent studies have unveiled the pivotal role of the intraflagellar transport complex B in the maintenance and functionality of ciliated cells. In this context, the perturbation of this protein complex has been associated with a spectrum of ciliopathies, underscoring its significance in cellular homeostasis. In an experimental model employing Caenorhabditis elegans, disruptions in the intraflagellar transport complex B led to notable defects in ciliary structure, which were manifest in aberrant motility and sensory behaviors. Concurrently, the application of high-throughput screening techniques has facilitated the identification of small molecules with potential therapeutic effects, revealing that certain kinase inhibitors can ameliorate the phenotypic consequences of defective intraflagellar transport complex B. Further biochemical assays confirmed that these small molecules did not directly modulate the complex itself, but rather influenced upstream signaling pathways, offering valuable insights into the regulation of ciliary function. As such, these findings not only elucidate the fundamental biological processes governing ciliary dynamics but also pave the way for novel interventions in the treatment of related diseases.
