prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: H3 HAT. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In a recent investigation into chromatin remodeling and its association with carcinogenesis, the H3 HAT protein complex emerged as a pivotal modifier of histone acetylation patterns. The study, employing a murine model of colorectal cancer, revealed that altered expression of H3 HAT correlates with significant changes in chromatin structure, facilitating aberrant gene expression profiles that drive malignant transformation. In vitro assays using colorectal cancer cell lines treated with a histone deacetylase inhibitor showcased the restoration of normal acetylation levels, implicating the potential of the H3 HAT complex as a therapeutic target. Furthermore, mass spectrometry-based proteomic analysis substantiated the hypoacetylation of histone H3 in the absence of functional H3 HAT activity. This evidence converges on the hypothesis that the modulation of H3 HAT levels represents a promising avenue for the development of epigenetic therapies tailored to counteract oncogenic histone modification patterns. Subsequent studies are warranted to elucidate the molecular mechanisms by which H3 HAT activity is regulated and to explore the complex's interaction with other chromatin remodelers and transcription factors implicated in cancer pathogenesis.
