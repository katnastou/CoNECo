prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: NADH-Q oxidoreductase. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In the current study, we sought to elucidate the role of NADH-Q oxidoreductase in the mitochondrial electron transport chain and its impact on cellular metabolism under oxidative stress conditions. Murine models were subjected to a controlled increase in reactive oxygen species (ROS) through a tailored administration of paraquat, a well-known inducer of oxidative stress. Subsequent to paraquat exposure, mitochondria were isolated from hepatic cells, and the enzymatic activity of NADH-Q oxidoreductase was assessed using spectrophotometric assays designed to measure the rate of reduction of ubiquinone to ubiquinol. It was hypothesized that an impairment in NADH-Q oxidoreductase function could lead to a bottleneck in electron transfer, thereby elevating the NADH/NAD+ ratio, and ultimately resulting in enhanced production of ROS. Furthermore, we investigated the possibility that prolonged oxidative stress could instigate a feedback loop, disrupting the integrity of the mitochondrial membrane potential and impairing ATP synthesis. The findings indicated a significant decrease in NADH-Q oxidoreductase activity in the presence of high ROS levels, suggesting that the complex may be susceptible to oxidative damage, which could contribute to the pathogenesis of certain metabolic disorders. These results underscore the necessity for deeper exploration of protective mechanisms that can enhance NADH-Q oxidoreductase resilience and stability, which may offer novel therapeutic avenues for diseases characterized by mitochondrial dysfunction.
