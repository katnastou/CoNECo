prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: RQC. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: Recent advancements in our understanding of protein quality control mechanisms have unveiled the pivotal role of the Ribosome-associated Quality Control complex (RQC) in addressing stalled translation events within the cells of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The fidelity of protein synthesis, which is critical for cellular function and homeostasis, can be compromised by a myriad of factors, including oxidative stress or the presence of deleterious chemicals such as puromycin. In such circumstances, RQC intervenes to mediate the response and resolution of stalled polypeptides, thereby safeguarding the integrity of the proteome. Our study sought to elucidate the mechanistic nuances by which RQC recognizes and processes aberrant translation products, employing an array of biochemical assays complemented by high-resolution cryo-electron microscopy. Intriguingly, our results demonstrate that upon encountering a stalled ribosome, RQC is adept at discerning the nascent polypeptide, engaging it in a manner that promotes its ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation, a crucial step in mitigating the potential cytotoxic effects that could give rise to proteopathies. This article discusses the implications of RQC-mediated quality control for cellular resilience in the face of proteotoxic challenges and highlights potential avenues for targeting RQC in the therapeutic management of diseases characterized by protein aggregation.
