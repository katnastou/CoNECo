prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: GABA-T. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In the recent study, we have investigated the role of GABA-T in the metabolism of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) within the central nervous system of rodent models. Previous literature has extensively characterized GABA as the principal inhibitory neurotransmitter, whose dysregulation is implicated in various neurological conditions, including epilepsy, anxiety disorders, and schizophrenia. In the present work, we sought to elucidate the impact of GABA-T activity on GABAergic neurotransmission and consequent behavioral phenotypes. Our experiments employed both pharmacological inhibition and upregulation of GABA-T to assess alterations in GABA catabolism. Remarkably, we observed that perturbing GABA-T functionality not only disturbed GABA levels but also significantly affected glutamate concentrations, suggesting a critical balance between excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmission maintained by GABA-T activity. Following the administration of a specific GABA-T inhibitor, subjects exhibited a reduction in seizure susceptibility, aligning with the hypothesis that enhanced GABAergic signaling provides a protective effect against hyperexcitability. These findings advance our comprehension of GABA-T in neurochemical homeostasis and propose potential therapeutic avenues for the management of neurological disorders involving GABAergic dysregulation.
