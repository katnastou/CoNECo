prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: NendoU. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In a recent study published in the "Journal of Molecular Biology and Therapeutics", the protein complex NendoU has emerged as a pivotal factor in the pathogenesis of certain viral infections. Through a series of in vitro assays and in vivo analyses using murine models, researchers have delineated the mechanism by which NendoU contributes to the replication fidelity of RNA viruses. The protein complex was found to exhibit a specific binding affinity for ssRNA molecules, a trait suggesting its potential role in the viral life cycle. Moreover, the presence of NendoU was correlated with enhanced viral titers in infected host cells, pointing to its critical function in viral propagation. Notably, experiments using selective inhibitors have demonstrated that disruption of NendoU activity results in a marked reduction in the pathogenicity of the virus, without exerting cytotoxic effects on the host cells. This finding indicates that NendoU could be a novel therapeutic target for the treatment of viral diseases. Future studies aim to explore the therapeutic window of NendoU inhibitors and to evaluate their efficacy in a broader range of organisms. The specificity of NendoU's function and its role in disease progression holds promise for the development of targeted antiviral strategies with minimal off-target effects.
