prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: spectrin. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In a recent study, the interaction between the spectrin protein complex and the cellular membrane has been elucidated in the context of erythrocyte flexibility and integrity. Previous research has indicated that impaired spectrin function is associated with the onset of hereditary hemolytic anemias, such as hereditary spherocytosis. In this study, we utilized cryo-electron microscopy to observe spectrin's strategic lattice formation on the cytosolic side of the plasma membrane, which forms a supportive scaffold that is vital for maintaining the biconcave shape of erythrocytes. This scaffolding facilitates the cells' remarkable elasticity, enabling them to traverse through the narrowest capillaries without rupture. The resilience of this protein complex is thought to be modulated by intracellular calcium levels and ATP, which suggests a possible target for therapeutic interventions. In vitro assays have demonstrated that exposure to elevated calcium concentrations can result in the alteration of spectrin's structural conformation, leading to a compromised ability to withstand mechanical stress. These findings highlight the spectrin complex's critical role in erythrocyte function and its potential as a therapeutic target in the treatment of erythrocyte fragility disorders.
