prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: GDC. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In a recent study, we sought to investigate the regulatory mechanisms underpinning cellular apoptosis in the context of oncogenic stress, with a particular focus on the novel protein complex GDC. This multiprotein complex has emerged as a pivotal player in the modulation of signal transduction pathways that mediate cellular responses to DNA damage. Utilizing a series of in vitro assays complemented by mouse models, we observed that the inhibition of GDC disrupts the repair of double-strand breaks, leading to an accumulation of genomic instability. Our results highlight GDC as a critical effector in the maintenance of genomic integrity, especially under conditions that predispose cells to oncogenesis. Significantly, upon treatment with a specific inhibitor, we detected increased levels of apoptosis in cancer cell lines, suggesting that the targeted disruption of GDC functions may provide a therapeutic advantage in the treatment of certain malignancies. Further investigations are required to delineate the precise biochemical interactions involving GDC and its regulatory impact on cell cycle progression and apoptosis. These findings open new avenues for the development of targeted anti-cancer therapies that exploit the vulnerabilities of cancer cells in DNA damage response and repair mechanisms.
