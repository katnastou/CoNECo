prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: DOM-B.C. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In the recently published findings from a landmark study, the role of the DOM-B.C protein complex within the context of neuronal development has been elucidated with greater clarity than previously achieved. Utilizing an array of sophisticated biochemical assays, the research team was able to demonstrate that DOM-B.C is critically involved in the modulation of synaptic plasticity. It appears that it accomplishes this by interacting with specific signaling pathways that are triggered by synaptic activity. The team's meticulous in vitro experiments showed that the presence of DOM-B.C can significantly enhance certain intracellular responses to calcium ions, a key secondary messenger in neurons. Furthermore, in vivo studies utilizing a murine model revealed that animals deficient in DOM-B.C exhibited marked behavioral abnormalities, suggesting that dysregulation of this protein complex can contribute to the pathophysiology of neurodevelopmental disorders. These experimental results provide a promising foundation for potential therapeutic interventions targeting DOM-B.C, with the hope of mitigating symptoms corresponding to synaptic dysfunction in various neurological conditions.
