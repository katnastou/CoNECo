prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: 5-hydroxyisourate hydrolase. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In the recent study published by the International Journal of Biochemistry and Cellular Biology, we explored the enzymatic kinetics and substrate specificity of the protein complex 5-hydroxyisourate hydrolase within the context of uric acid degradation. The catalytic efficiency of 5-hydroxyisourate hydrolase was evaluated under various pH conditions and in the presence of different metal ion cofactors. Our findings indicate an optimal catalytic activity at a pH of 7.5, and a marked increase in substrate turnover in the presence of magnesium ions. Furthermore, investigations into the protein complex's structure-function relationship revealed a significant conformational change upon substrate binding, which is hypothesized to be crucial for its enzymatic function. The research presents a vital step towards understanding the metabolic pathways involved in purine degradation, which potentially has implications for the treatment of diseases such as gout, where uric acid accumulation is a pathological hallmark. As such, the characterization of the 5-hydroxyisourate hydrolase protein complex may provide novel therapeutic insights into the management of hyperuricemia and its associated clinical manifestations.
