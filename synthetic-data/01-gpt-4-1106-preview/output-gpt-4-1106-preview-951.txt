prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: GMPR2. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In the current study, we sought to elucidate the functional implications of GMPR2 in cellular metabolism and its potential role in the pathogenesis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). GMPR2's activity was assessed by measuring the conversion rates of guanosine monophosphate (GMP) to inosine monophosphate (IMP) in both healthy human hepatocytes and HCC lines. The experimental design included a kinetic analysis of GMPR2 under varying substrate concentrations to determine its catalytic efficiency and the impact of metabolic stress on its function. In HCC cells, a notable upregulation of GMPR2 was observed in conjunction with elevated levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS), suggesting a possible link between GMPR2 activity and oxidative stress pathways. Moreover, the analysis of tissue samples from patients with HCC revealed a consistent overexpression of GMPR2, compared to matched non-tumorigenic liver tissues. This overexpression correlated with poor prognostic outcomes, including reduced overall survival and increased tumor aggressiveness. The findings implicate GMPR2 as a potential biomarker for HCC prognosis and a putative target for therapeutic intervention, warranting further investigation into its mechanistic contributions to tumorigenesis and its interplay with the broader metabolic milieu in hepatocellular carcinoma.
