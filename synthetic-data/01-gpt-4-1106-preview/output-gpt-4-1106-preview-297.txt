prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: CstF. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In an effort to delineate the molecular pathways underpinning RNA polyadenylation, recent investigations have centered on the functional dynamics of the cleavage stimulation factor complex (CstF). CstF, a crucial protein complex implicated in the pre-mRNA 3' end processing, has been observed to exhibit a substantive affinity towards GU-rich downstream sequences, a characteristic believed to facilitate the cleavage and polyadenylation of pre-mRNA transcripts. Notably, a study utilizing mammalian cell lines posited that the presence of CstF is essential for the recognition and subsequent binding to the polyadenylation signal, underscoring its significance in the maturation of mRNA. Moreover, aberrations in the regulatory mechanisms of CstF have been tentatively associated with the pathogenesis of various neoplasms, highlighting a potential therapeutic target. The modulation of CstF activity by small molecules has, therefore, become a subject of intense research focus, with the aim of unveiling novel pharmacological strategies to correct dysregulated gene expression profiles that accompany oncogenic transformations. Concurrently, advances in CRISPR-Cas9 technology have enabled researchers to manipulate specific sequences within the cellular genome, providing invaluable insights into the relationship between CstF-mediated polyadenylation and gene expression regulation. As such, CstF has emerged as a pivotal protein complex in the post-transcriptional orchestration of gene expression, with far-reaching implications for understanding the intricacies of cellular function and disease etiology.
