prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: KEOPSs. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: Recent advancements in the understanding of nucleotide biosynthesis have spotlighted the pivotal role of the KEOPSs complex in the cellular mechanisms driving tRNA modification. This intricate protein arrangement is implicated in the promotion of t6A modification, a crucial process that enhances the accuracy and efficiency of protein synthesis within the eukaryotic ribosome. In the current study, we sought to elucidate the contribution of KEOPSs complex to cellular homeostasis in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Employing a battery of biochemical assays and high-throughput sequencing techniques, we observed that the perturbation of KEOPSs function led to a cascade of translational inefficiencies, ultimately culminating in diminished cellular proliferation. Strikingly, the dysregulation of KEOPSs activity was found to be associated with an increased susceptibility to oxidative stress, as evidenced by heightened cellular damage upon exposure to hydrogen peroxide. This vulnerability suggests an interplay between KEOPSs-mediated tRNA modifications and the maintenance of redox equilibrium, revealing potential therapeutic targets for diseases characterized by oxidative stress imbalances, such as neurodegenerative disorders. These findings underscore the essentiality of KEOPSs in safeguarding the translational machinery and highlight its broader significance in cellular defense mechanisms.
