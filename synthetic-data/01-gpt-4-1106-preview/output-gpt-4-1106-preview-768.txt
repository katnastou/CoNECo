prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: DDS. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we examined the regulatory role of the DDS protein complex in cellular apoptosis pathways. Previous research has suggested that dysregulation of apoptosis mechanisms can contribute to the development of various oncological conditions, prompting us to explore DDS in the context of cancer biology. Utilizing a series of in vitro assays, the DDS complex was found to interact with key signaling molecules, indicating a potential modulatory function in the intrinsic apoptosis pathway. In murine models, overexpression of DDS led to a marked decrease in tumor proliferation, affirming its importance. Intriguingly, analysis of patient histological samples revealed a lower expression level of DDS in malignant tissues as compared to adjacent normal tissues. Furthermore, treatment of cell cultures with chemotherapeutic agents resulted in an upregulation of DDS, suggesting that its expression may be influenced by external stressors. This evidence positions the DDS complex as a novel candidate for targeted therapy, and future investigations will focus on elucidating the precise molecular mechanisms by which DDS influences cell fate decisions. Additional studies employing CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing will be instrumental in uncovering the complex interplay between DDS and other pathways involved in tumorigenesis and chemotherapy resistance. As such, DDS represents a promising avenue for therapeutic intervention in the treatment of cancer.
