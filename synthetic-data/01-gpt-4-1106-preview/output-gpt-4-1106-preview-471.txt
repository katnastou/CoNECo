prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: VLA-4. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The integrin VLA-4 plays a pivotal role in the pathophysiology of multiple sclerosis (MS), an autoimmune disorder characterized by chronic inflammation and demyelination in the central nervous system (CNS). Recent studies have suggested that the inhibition of VLA-4 can lead to a decrease in the migration of leukocytes across the blood-brain barrier (BBB), thereby ameliorating the progression of MS. Our latest research investigates the therapeutic potential of a novel small molecule inhibitor specifically targeting VLA-4. Using a murine model of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), a well-established surrogate for human MS, we administered the inhibitor both prophylactically and therapeutically. The results indicated a significant reduction in the infiltration of inflammatory cells into the CNS following treatment, as evidenced by decreased CNS lesion load and improved motor function. These outcomes support the hypothesis that VLA-4 is a critical mediator of leukocyte transmigration in autoimmune conditions and could serve as a promising target for the development of new MS therapies. Further investigations are required to elucidate the long-term efficacy and safety profile of VLA-4 targeted interventions in clinical settings.
