prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: Choriogonadotropin. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In the recent study on the multi-modal approach to elucidate the roles of various hormone complexes in reproductive physiology, a noteworthy focus has been placed on Choriogonadotropin and its interaction with specific cell-surface receptors. Choriogonadotropin, a heterodimeric glycoprotein, has been shown to play a pivotal role in the maintenance of corpus luteum during the initial stages of pregnancy in humans. The research utilized a combination of X-ray crystallography and single-particle cryo-electron microscopy to divulge the three-dimensional structure of Choriogonadotropin at an atomic level. This structural elucidation has provided significant insights into its binding affinity and mechanism of signal transduction upon engagement with its receptor. Further investigations employing an array of biochemical assays have demonstrated that the complex modulates downstream signaling pathways, which leads to the production of progesterone, an essential steroid hormone during pregnancy. The implications of these findings have remarkable potential for the development of novel therapeutic interventions aimed at treating infertility disorders as well as the design of contraceptives targeting the precise bioactivity of Choriogonadotropin. Subsequent in vivo studies in model organisms have established a dosage-dependent relationship between administration of Choriogonadotropin and the restoration of luteal function, reinforcing its clinical significance in reproductive endocrinology.
