prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: STR. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: Recent studies have indicated that the STR complex may play a pivotal role in the cellular response to oxidative stress, primarily through its interaction with specific signaling pathways. In a controlled in vitro environment, cultured neuronal cells exposed to hydrogen peroxide exhibited an overexpression of STR, implicating its potential role as a defensive mechanism against reactive oxygen species. This upregulation of STR corresponded with an increase in cell survival rates, suggesting a protective function that could be crucial for understanding the molecular underpinnings of neurodegenerative disorders. Moreover, pharmacological inhibition of the STR complex resulted in heightened cellular susceptibility to oxidative damage, further buttressing the hypothesis of its involvement in stress response mechanisms. These findings imply that STR might serve as a novel therapeutic target for conditions characterized by oxidative stress, such as Parkinson's disease. Future studies are warranted to dissect the precise biochemical pathways mediated by STR and to explore its relevance in the pathology of other oxidative stress-linked diseases.
