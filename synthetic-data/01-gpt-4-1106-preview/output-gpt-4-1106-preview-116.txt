prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: UvrABC excinuclease. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In a recent study published in the Journal of Molecular Biology and Genetics, the efficacy of the UvrABC excinuclease in repairing UV-induced DNA lesions was meticulously evaluated. Embarked upon elucidation of the DNA damage response, the research presented a detailed quantitative analysis of the excision repair process mediated by the UvrABC excinuclease in *Escherichia coli* models. This protein complex operates as a crucial component in the nucleotide excision repair (NER) pathway which maintains genomic stability by rectifying a myriad of structurally unrelated DNA lesions. With the application of a novel in vivo assay allowing real-time observation, the study demonstrated that the UvrABC excinuclease efficiently identifies and excises bulky adducts produced by UV radiation, thereby preventing the onset of potentially mutagenic or cytotoxic events. Furthermore, experimental trials using chemotherapeutic agents revealed a significant reduction in DNA repair efficiency following the pharmacological inhibition of the UvrABC excinuclease, underscoring its potential as a therapeutic target in cancer treatment regimens that aim to capitalize on synthetic lethality. The implications of these findings are vast, ranging from insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying repair processes to the development of innovative strategies for enhancing the efficacy of DNA-damaging agents used in oncology.
