prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: RuvABC Holliday junction resolvasome. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: Recent studies have elucidated the pivotal role of the RuvABC Holliday junction resolvasome in DNA damage repair mechanisms, particularly in relation to homologous recombination. The integrity of genomic information during cell division necessitates the precise and timely resolution of Holliday junctions, a task primarily entrusted to the RuvABC Holliday junction resolvasome complex. In our experimental model using Escherichia coli, we observed that exposure to DNA-damaging agents such as ultraviolet radiation and various mutagens induced the formation of Holliday junctions. Subsequent assays demonstrated that in cells lacking a functional RuvABC Holliday junction resolvasome, there was an accumulation of unresolved recombination intermediates. These intermediates corresponded with an increase in chromosome segregation errors, culminating in elevated rates of cell mortality. Further, in vivo analysis showed that the malfunction of this complex correlates with hallmark features of genomic instability, a known predisposing factor for the development of several malignancies in multicellular organisms. These findings underscore the RuvABC Holliday junction resolvasome's essentiality in maintaining genomic stability by efficiently directing the resolution of Holliday junctions, thereby safeguarding the cell's hereditary material against the deleterious consequences of DNA repair defects.
