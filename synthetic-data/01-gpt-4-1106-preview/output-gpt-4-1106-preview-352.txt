prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: MlaFEDB. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In recent advancements within the realm of membrane transport mechanisms, the MlaFEDB protein complex has drawn considerable attention due to its role in maintaining outer membrane asymmetry in Gram-negative bacteria. This intricate protein assembly is implicated in the shuttling of phospholipids between the outer and inner membranes, a critical process for bacterial homeostasis and pathogenesis. In a groundbreaking study, we sought to elucidate the mechanistic particulars of the MlaFEDB complex by employing cryo-electron microscopy, revealing unprecedented insights into the structural conformation under physiological conditions. Notably, our investigation demonstrated that the presence of calcium ions is paramount in stabilizing the architecture of MlaFEDB, denoting a potential vulnerability that could be exploited for therapeutic intervention. Subsequent in vitro assays confirmed that perturbation of calcium homeostasis indeed resulted in compromised function of the MlaFEDB complex, leading to increased sensitivity of bacteria such as Escherichia coli to outer membrane stress. Furthermore, in a murine sepsis model, targeting the regulatory mechanism of the MlaFEDB complex attenuated the virulence of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, suggesting a novel approach for the treatment of bacterial infections that circumvents the growing challenge of antibiotic resistance. This research delineates a promising avenue for the development of anti-virulence strategies, with the MlaFEDB complex offering a tantalizing target for next-generation antimicrobial therapeutics.
