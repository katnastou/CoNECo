prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: MECO. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we aimed to elucidate the role of the mitochondrial ensconced complex one (MECO) in the regulation of cellular metabolism under stress conditions. Human-derived fibroblast cultures were subjected to hypoxic conditions to mimic the metabolic stress observed in solid tumor microenvironments. Through a series of immunoprecipitation assays followed by mass spectrometry, we observed a significant increase in the presence of MECO under low oxygen tension, suggesting an adaptive response. Subsequently, metabolic flux analysis revealed an alteration in the mitochondrial respiration patterns, with a notable shift towards anaerobic glycolysis, commonly referred to as the Warburg effect. Treatment with the chemical inhibitors rotenone and antimycin A, which target components of the electron transport chain, resulted in a marked reduction in MECO levels. This indicates a potential feedback mechanism where MECO is implicated in the cellular economy during pathological states, such as cancer and ischemic diseases. Our findings suggest that MECO may serve as a therapeutic target or a biomarker for metabolic dysregulation in various pathologies. Further investigations are warranted to explore the mechanistic pathways through which MECO mediates these broad-spectrum metabolic adaptations.
