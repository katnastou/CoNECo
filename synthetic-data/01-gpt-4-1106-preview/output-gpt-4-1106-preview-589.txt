prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: membrane-bound IgA1. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: Recent advances in immunology have shed light on the functional significance of the protein complex membrane-bound IgA1 in mucosal immunity. Investigations utilizing mouse models have shown that membrane-bound IgA1 plays a pivotal role in safeguarding mucosal surfaces against pathogenic intrusion. In this context, the protein complex contributes to barrier integrity by mediating the immune exclusion of antigens and pathogens. Specifically, our data demonstrate a direct correlation between the expression levels of membrane-bound IgA1 and the efficiency of mucosal defense in the gastrointestinal tract. Furthermore, studies involving human epithelial cell lines have delineated the mechanism by which membrane-bound IgA1 facilitates antigen sampling and subsequent immune clearance. Notably, the absence of membrane-bound IgA1 has been implicated in increased susceptibility to enteric infections, such as those caused by Escherichia coli. Moreover, clinical observations have also begun to suggest an intriguing link between abnormal regulation of membrane-bound IgA1 and the pathogenesis of chronic inflammatory conditions, including inflammatory bowel disease. Collectively, these findings endorse the therapeutic potential of targeting membrane-bound IgA1 to enhance mucosal immunity and treat related diseases.
