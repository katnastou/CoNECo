prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: cytosolic large ribosomal subunit. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we investigated the role of the cytosolic large ribosomal subunit in the pathogenesis of Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), a debilitating muscle-wasting disease. Previous research has predominantly focused on genetic and metabolic factors, yet the impact of ribosomal function on muscular disease progression remains underexplored. We utilized murine models and patient-derived myoblasts to observe the interaction between the cytosolic large ribosomal subunit and the translational machinery during the synthesis of dystrophin, the protein missing or deficient in individuals with DMD. Our observations indicate that the efficiency of translation and proper folding of dystrophin precursors is modulated by the integrity of this ribosomal subunit. Furthermore, we treated the cells with an array of chemical compounds known to influence ribosomal activity, with results suggesting that specific modulators can partially restore the functional capacity of dystrophin synthesis. These findings highlight a potential novel therapeutic approach, targeting the cytosolic large ribosomal subunit to ameliorate disease symptoms in DMD, an approach that warrants further biochemical and clinical investigations.
