prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: COMPASS. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In a recent groundbreaking study to elucidate the mechanisms underlying epigenetic regulation, the COMPASS protein complex has been found to play a pivotal role. Researchers have demonstrated that this complex is essential in the methylation of histone H3 lysine 4 (H3K4me), a post-translational modification known to correlate with active transcription. Utilizing Chromatin Immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing (ChIP-seq), the distribution of this modification across the genome of Saccharomyces cerevisiae was mapped, revealing that COMPASS occupancy is closely associated with promoter regions upstream of genes involved in yeast metabolism. Furthermore, the loss of COMPASS function resulted in a significant decrease in H3K4me levels, leading to transcriptional dysregulation and growth defects. This highlights COMPASS's crucial role in maintaining genome stability and proper gene expression. The implications of these findings are profound, suggesting potential therapeutic targets for diseases where epigenetic dysregulation is a contributing factor, such as cancer. Further investigations are warranted to explore the interactions between COMPASS and other chromatin modifiers, and their collective impact on cell fate and disease progression.
