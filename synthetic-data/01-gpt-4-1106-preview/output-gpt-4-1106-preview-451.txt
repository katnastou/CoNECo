prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: AHAS III. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In the recent study by Liu et al., the intricate role of AHAS III in the biosynthetic pathway of branched-chain amino acids has been elucidated through a series of in vitro assays and in vivo models. Branched-chain amino acids, such as leucine, isoleucine, and valine, play pivotal roles in protein synthesis and metabolic regulation in a variety of organisms, including humans. AHAS III, an enzyme complex of significant interest, has shown a high affinity for its substrates and is postulated to be a potential target for the development of novel antimicrobial agents, given its absence in mammalian systems. The research featured an extensive analysis of AHAS III activity under different concentrations of pyruvate, revealing an allosteric modulation mechanism that could be exploited for therapeutic benefits. Furthermore, the implications of AHAS III inhibition were observed in Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains, serving as a proxy for understanding the potential side effects on cellular metabolism in more complex eukaryotic systems. Importantly, aberrations in AHAS III activity have been linked to significant growth defects, suggesting its critical role in maintaining homeostasis within the cellular environment. The insights gained into the function of AHAS III provide a promising foundation for the development of drugs aimed at combating metabolic disorders and enhancing agricultural productivity through targeted manipulation of amino acid synthesis pathways.
