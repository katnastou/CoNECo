prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: connexon. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In the recent study published in the Journal of Cellular Physiology, the role of the protein complex connexon in intercellular communication within the cardiac tissue of Rattus norvegicus was meticulously elucidated. The team employed a multifaceted approach, incorporating both in vitro and in vivo techniques, to assess the impact of oxidative stress—an upshot of the increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) production—on the functional integrity of connexon. The myocardial cells cultured under hyperoxic conditions exhibited a marked reduction in connexon-mediated cell-cell coupling, highlighting the vulnerability of the connexon complexes to ROS-induced damage. Furthermore, in vivo experimentation involving induced myocardial infarction demonstrated a significant downregulation of connexon in the border zone of the infarct region, a phenomenon that may underpin the arrhythmogenic substrate characteristic of ischemic heart disease. Thus, the research posits that the maintenance of connexon functionality is imperative for preserving the synchrony of myocardial contractility and posits this protein complex as a potential therapeutic target in reducing the morbidity associated with cardiac pathologies.
