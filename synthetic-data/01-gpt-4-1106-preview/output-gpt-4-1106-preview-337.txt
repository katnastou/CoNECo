prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: TCC. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In the recent study published in the Journal of Cellular Biochemistry, the activity of the TCC (Teratocarcinoma-derived Growth Factor 1) complex and its role in cellular homeostasis have been thoroughly investigated. The research was conducted using an in vivo mouse model as well as cultured human cell lines to elucidate the implications of TCC malfunction in disease pathology. Notably, the presence of TCC in various tissues was correlated with the regulation of metabolic processes, particularly the oxidative phosphorylation pathway in mitochondria. Additionally, aberrant TCC activity was linked to a perturbation in calcium ion homeostasis, which is a critical factor in maintaining cellular functions. Such disruptions were observed to have a direct association with the onset of neurodegenerative disorders, suggesting that TCC may play a pivotal role in the prevention of diseases such as Alzheimer's. Moreover, the intervention with pharmaceutical agents that modulate the activity of TCC unveiled promising therapeutic avenues. These findings shed new light on the potential of targeting TCC not only for understanding the underlying mechanisms of certain metabolic diseases but also for the development of novel intervention strategies.
