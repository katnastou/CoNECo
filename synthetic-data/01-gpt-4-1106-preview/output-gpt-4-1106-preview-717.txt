prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: CDL7. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In our recent study, published in the "Journal of Molecular Biomedicine," we have elucidated the role of the protein complex CDL7 in the regulation of apoptosis in murine models. Apoptosis, a form of programmed cell death crucial for maintaining cellular homeostasis, has been extensively studied due to its implication in a plethora of diseases, including cancer and neurodegenerative disorders. Our research indicates that CDL7 plays a pivotal role in the apoptotic cascade by modulating the intrinsic mitochondrial pathway. In experiments utilizing specific inhibitors and activators of apoptosis, it was observed that the presence of CDL7 enhanced the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria into the cytosol of murine cells, thereby initiating the downstream activation of caspases. Moreover, genetic knockdown of CDL7 resulted in marked resistance to apoptotic stimuli such as UV irradiation and treatment with chemotherapeutic agents like cisplatin. The implications of these findings present promising therapeutic targets, as modulating the activity of CDL7 could lead to novel interventions in diseases characterized by dysregulated apoptosis. Further investigations are warranted to fully elucidate the molecular mechanisms by which CDL7 influences apoptosis and its potential cross-talk with other cellular pathways in various physiological and pathological contexts.
