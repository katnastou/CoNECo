prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: 5HT3AR. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In the pursuit of understanding the pathophysiology of gastrointestinal disorders, significant attention has been focused on the role of serotonergic pathways, particularly the 5HT3AR protein complex. Recent studies have delineated the 5HT3AR's pivotal involvement in modulating visceral pain, a common symptom in conditions such as irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Utilizing a murine model, the effects of selective antagonists on the 5HT3AR were examined, revealing a marked attenuation in pain response when compared to untreated cohorts. Furthermore, affinity binding assays confirmed high specificity of these antagonists to the 5HT3AR, suggesting minimal off-target effects. Histological analysis showed no discernible morphological changes in the gastrointestinal mucosa, supporting the complex's role as a modulator rather than a structural constituent. The implications for therapeutic intervention are profound, as targeting the 5HT3AR may provide a novel avenue for the development of highly selective drugs, aimed at mitigating the visceral hyperalgesia associated with gastrointestinal disorders without the deleterious side effects often observed with less targeted pharmacological treatments.
