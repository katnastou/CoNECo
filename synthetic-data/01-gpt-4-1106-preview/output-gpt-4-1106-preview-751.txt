prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: discoidal HDL. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In the recent study published in the Journal of Molecular Cardiology, we investigated the role of discoidal HDL in the regulation of cholesterol homeostasis within vascular endothelial cells. Cholesterol efflux is a critical function of discoidal HDL, facilitating the transport of cholesterol from the peripheral tissues back to the liver for excretion, thus playing a pivotal role in the prevention of atherosclerosis. Our in vitro assays involved exposing cultured human endothelial cells to physiological concentrations of discoidal HDL and assessing the subsequent effects on cholesterol efflux mechanisms. These assays demonstrated a significant increase in cholesterol removal from cells in the presence of discoidal HDL when compared to control conditions. Furthermore, the application of specific pharmacological inhibitors allowed for the elucidation of the cellular signaling pathways engaged by discoidal HDL, revealing a notable involvement of the PI3K-Akt pathway. Remarkably, in an in vivo murine model of hypercholesterolemia, the administration of discoidal HDL led to a reduction in atherosclerotic plaque formation in comparison to animals receiving a placebo, suggesting a direct beneficial impact of discoidal HDL on vascular health. These findings underscore the therapeutic potential of discoidal HDL in the treatment of cardiovascular diseases and lay the groundwork for the development of novel strategies aiming to enhance the protective functions of this lipoprotein in atherogenesis.
