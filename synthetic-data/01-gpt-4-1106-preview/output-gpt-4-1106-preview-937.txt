prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: ATAC. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: Recent advances in the delineation of chromatin remodeling mechanisms have underscored the significance of the ATAC in the regulation of transcriptional processes critical for cellular differentiation and development. In a recent study, we have characterized the impact of mutations in constituents of the ATAC on the epigenetic landscape of murine embryonic stem cells. Our findings revealed that these mutations led to a profound disorganization in the structure of chromatin, as evidenced by aberrant patterns of histone acetylation and methylation across key developmental loci. Furthermore, upon exposure to differentiation signals, cells harboring defective ATAC function exhibited a marked reduction in their ability to transition into neural lineage-specific phenotypes, as compared to their wild-type counterparts. These phenotypic alterations were accompanied by substantive changes in the expression profiles of genes implicated in neural development and function. Concomitant treatment with histone deacetylase inhibitors partially rescued the observed phenotypes, suggesting a potential therapeutic avenue for diseases associated with ATAC dysfunction. The elucidation of ATAC's role in chromatin dynamics provides a crucial insight into the molecular underpinnings of epigenetic regulation and offers a promising target for interventions in diseases marked by perturbed gene expression.
