prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: condensin. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In a recent study published in the Journal of Molecular Biology, we investigated the role of the condensin complex in the structural organization of chromosomes during mitosis. The functional integrity of this multiprotein assembly is critical for the compaction and segregation of chromatin, which ensures accurate genetic information transfer between cell divisions. Utilizing Saccharomyces cerevisiae as a model organism, the impact of various environmental stresses, such as oxidative damage and temperature fluctuations, on the stability and function of the condensin complex was assessed. Our findings demonstrate a significant increase in chromosomal missegregation events correlating with disruptions in condensin activity, suggesting that the complex is a key determinant in maintaining genomic stability. Moreover, when examining tissue samples from patients with colorectal cancer, a marked reduction in the expression levels and localization of the condensin complex was observed, hypothesizing a link between condensin dysregulation and tumorigenesis. This study provides new insights into the molecular mechanisms of chromosome dynamics and underscores the potential for targeting the condensin complex in cancer therapy.
