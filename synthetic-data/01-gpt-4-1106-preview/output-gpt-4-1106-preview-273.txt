prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: Imitation switch two. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In a recent study, we investigated the regulatory function of the Imitation Switch two complex within the intricate signaling pathways associated with cardiac hypertrophy. Cardiac tissue samples, collected from murine models subjected to transverse aortic constriction (TAC), exhibited a marked upregulation of the Imitation Switch two complex in comparison to sham-operated controls. This upregulation was positively correlated with an increase in cardiac fibroblast proliferation and the subsequent fibrosis observed in post-TAC heart samples. Chemical inhibition of the TAC-induced hypertrophic response led to a significant decrease in the presence of the Imitation Switch two complex, suggesting a potential therapeutic target for the mitigation of cardiac hypertrophy. Further assessment of downstream signaling processes revealed that the Imitation Switch two complex may play a critical role in modulating the balance between cardiomyocyte apoptosis and survival. These findings underscore the importance of the Imitation Switch two complex in cardiac pathology and offer insights that could drive the development of novel intervention strategies for heart diseases.
