prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: UTP-A. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The UTP-A complex plays a critical role in the early stages of ribosome biogenesis, particularly in the nucleolar organization and assembly of the precursors to the small ribosomal subunit. This study aimed to elucidate the functional dynamics of UTP-A within the distinct cellular context of eukaryotic organisms. We employed both in vivo and in vitro systems to systematically assess the interactions of UTP-A with ribonucleic acid (RNA) substrates, using Saccharomyces cerevisiae as a model organism. Our high-resolution chromatography techniques coupled with mass spectrometry allowed for detailed mapping of the RNA-binding landscape of UTP-A. Furthermore, we investigated the complex's response to varying ATP concentrations, given its putative role as an ATP-dependent RNA helicase. Its implication in ribosome biogenesis was further corroborated through the use of small molecule inhibitors, which demonstrated a significant reduction in ribosome production upon targeted disruption of UTP-A function. Intriguingly, perturbations in UTP-A activity were also correlated with alterations in cellular growth rates, indicating its potential importance in cellular fitness. This research thus sheds light on the multifaceted nature of UTP-A within the nucleolus, suggesting avenues for further investigation into ribosome assembly disorders and potential therapeutic interventions.
