prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: CRL5. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In the pursuit of understanding the mechanisms underlying oncogenesis, recent studies have highlighted the significance of the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) in the regulation of cellular processes. A key player within this system is the CRL5 protein complex, which serves as an E3 ubiquitin ligase, responsible for the transfer of ubiquitin to specific substrate proteins, thereby targeting them for proteasomal degradation. Accumulating evidence implicates CRL5 in the control of cell cycle progression and DNA damage response, processes which are critical for maintaining genomic integrity. Dysregulation of CRL5 activity has been observed in various malignancies, suggesting its potential role in tumorigenesis. Furthermore, the involvement of CRL5 in viral infections has become increasingly apparent, with certain viruses deploying mechanisms to hijack the CRL5 complex to degrade host proteins that are essential for antiviral responses. As such, pharmacological modulation of CRL5 activity could represent a novel therapeutic strategy for the treatment of particular cancers and viral diseases. In vitro assays confirm the specificity of CRL5 for its substrates, thus presenting opportunities for the development of targeted inhibitors that could selectively disrupt pathological protein degradation pathways. The complexity of the CRL5-mediated signaling underscores the necessity for comprehensive research dissecting its multifaceted roles in cellular homeostasis and pathology.
