prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: laminin-11. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The integrative properties of the extracellular matrix (ECM) are dynamically modulated by various protein complexes, among which laminin-11 plays a pivotal role in mediating cellular adhesion, migration, and structural integrity. Recent studies have elucidated the significance of laminin-11 in the context of neurogenesis, highlighting its utility in promoting neural stem cell differentiation in vitro. This protein complex facilitates the formation of stable, biologically active scaffolds that mimic the native ECM environment, thereby supporting the growth and maturation of neural tissues. In murine models, the upregulation of laminin-11 has been correlated with enhanced remyelination efficiency following injury, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target in demyelinating diseases such as multiple sclerosis. Moreover, biochemical assays have demonstrated that laminin-11's binding affinity to divalent cations, such as calcium and magnesium, is crucial for its structural conformation and functional capabilities, underscoring the importance of ion homeostasis in ECM-mediated signaling pathways. Further investigation into the molecular mechanisms governing laminin-11 interactions with cellular receptors may provide greater insight into its role in tissue homeostasis and the pathological progression of connective tissue disorders.
