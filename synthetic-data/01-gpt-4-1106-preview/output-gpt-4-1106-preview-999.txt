prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: E-RTC. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In the present study, we aimed to elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying the regulation of cellular responses to DNA damage focusing on the previously uncharacterized protein complex E-RTC. Our initial investigations utilized immunoprecipitation assays coupled with mass spectrometry to confirm the existence of E-RTC in human fibroblast cells and its increased concentration following treatment with the DNA-damaging agent, cisplatin. Subsequent experiments involving quantitative PCR revealed a significant upregulation of p21, a well-known cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor, in cells overexpressing E-RTC compared to the control group, suggesting a potential role for E-RTC in cell cycle arrest. Moreover, E-RTC depletion studies using short hairpin RNA demonstrated increased sensitivity to UV-induced apoptosis, indicating a pivotal contribution of this complex to the cellular DNA damage response. Collectively, these results implicate E-RTC as a novel player in the maintenance of genomic stability, with potential implications for understanding the pathophysiology of diseases characterized by compromised DNA repair mechanisms, such as certain cancers and genetic disorders. Further research is necessitated to precisely decipher the downstream pathways modulated by E-RTC, which may ultimately reveal novel therapeutic targets.
