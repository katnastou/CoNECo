prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: Colicin I receptor. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In a recent study aimed at elucidating the mechanisms of bacterial resistance, we have focused on the interaction between membrane-bound entities and external antibacterial proteins. The Colicin I receptor, a transmembrane protein complex located on the surface of Escherichia coli, has been identified as a primary gateway for certain bacteriocins. This study employed a combination of cryo-electron microscopy and X-ray crystallography to explore the three-dimensional conformation changes in the Colicin I receptor upon colicin binding. Subsequent in vitro assays demonstrated that the occupancy of the receptor by colicins disrupts the osmotic balance within the bacterial cell, often leading to cell death. Our inquiry extended to evaluate the protective role of certain exopolysaccharides against colicin-induced cytotoxicity, revealing a potential for therapeutic applications in the treatment of Gram-negative bacterial infections. The findings underscore the significance of the Colicin I receptor in mediating susceptibility to colicin-based bacteriolysis and offer insights into targeted antimicrobial strategies that could circumvent the rising tide of antibiotic resistance.
