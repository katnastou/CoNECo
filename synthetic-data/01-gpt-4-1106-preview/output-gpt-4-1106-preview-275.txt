prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: IL23A. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: Recent advances in the understanding of inflammatory pathways have shed light on the crucial role of the IL23A protein complex in mediating immune responses. In a groundbreaking study, researchers examined the expression of IL23A in various cell types involved in the pathogenesis of psoriasis. The study utilized advanced immunohistochemical techniques to quantify IL23A across a range of tissue samples obtained from both affected individuals and healthy controls. Results indicated a statistically significant overexpression of IL23A in the epidermal layers of psoriatic lesions, compared to negligible expression in normal skin tissue. Furthermore, the application of targeted biologic therapies demonstrated a reduction in IL23A expression, correlated with clinical amelioration of disease symptoms. These findings suggest a potential therapeutic avenue, whereby modulation of IL23A may contribute to the mitigation of inflammatory processes in psoriasis and possibly other autoimmune conditions. The implications for patient outcomes are profound, signaling a shift towards precision medicine where treatments are tailored to the molecular intricacies of individual diseases.
