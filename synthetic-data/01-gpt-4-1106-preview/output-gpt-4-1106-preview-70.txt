prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: laminin-332. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In recent studies, the role of laminin-332 has garnered significant attention due to its critical involvement in cell adhesion, migration, and proliferation within the basement membrane of epithelial tissues. This multifaceted protein complex has been observed in the context of wound healing processes, where its timely expression is essential for the re-epithelialization of damaged tissue. Moreover, aberrations in laminin-332 functionality have been correlated with the pathogenesis of several carcinomas, leading to an enhanced understanding of tumor invasion mechanisms. Investigating the interaction between laminin-332 and integrin receptors reveals a complex signaling pathway that orchestrates cellular dynamics and tissue architecture. Encouragingly, elucidating the intricacies of this protein complex's molecular interactions has provided new therapeutic targets for diseases characterized by compromised epithelial barrier function, which include diverse conditions such as epidermolysis bullosa and certain aggressive forms of squamous cell carcinoma. Thus, the study of laminin-332 not only enhances our basic biological knowledge but also holds promise for translational research and the development of targeted interventions aimed at modulating this protein complex for clinical benefit.
