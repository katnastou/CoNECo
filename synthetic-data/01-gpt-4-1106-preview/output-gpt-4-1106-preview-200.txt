prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: KICSTOR. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In a recent study examining the molecular mechanisms underlying autophagy regulation, the protein complex KICSTOR has been implicated as a critical factor in the nutrient-sensing pathway that converges on the mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1). Upon amino acid deprivation, KICSTOR interacts with the GATOR1 complex to inhibit mTORC1 signaling, thereby promoting the initiation of autophagy, a catabolic process that is essential for cellular homeostasis. The dysregulation of autophagy has been associated with a host of diseases, including neurodegenerative disorders and cancers, highlighting the therapeutic potential of modulating KICSTOR function. In vitro assays utilizing mammalian cell lines have revealed that pharmacological inhibition of KICSTOR-mTORC1 interaction results in enhanced autophagic flux, akin to that observed in fasting conditions, suggesting that small molecule modulators of KICSTOR could be a viable strategy for the treatment of diseases with impaired autophagy. However, understanding the fine-tuned regulation of KICSTOR and its impact on mTORC1 localization and activity within various physiological and pathological states requires further investigation, as does the exploration of potential side effects arising from chronic manipulation of this axis.
