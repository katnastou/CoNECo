prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: Rpd3S. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: Previous investigations have established the pivotal role of histone acetylation in the modulation of chromatin structure and function, which is critical in the regulation of gene expression across various organisms. In this context, the role of the Rpd3S protein complex has garnered significant attention due to its intricate involvement in the deacetylation of histones, particularly in regions of active transcription. Our most recent study delves into the mechanistic action of Rpd3S, assessing its selective binding affinity to acetylated histones within transcriptionally active domains. We employed chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by high-throughput sequencing (ChIP-seq) to elucidate the genomic distribution of Rpd3S in yeast cells subjected to oxidative stress. The data revealed a marked enrichment of Rpd3S at promoter regions proximal to stress response genes, suggesting a role in the attenuation of the transcriptional upregulation typically induced under such conditions. Furthermore, pharmacological inhibition of Rpd3S through the administration of a specific small molecule inhibitor led to a substantial dysregulation of the expression of these genes, hinting at a therapeutic potential in pathologies hallmarked by chromatin deregulation, such as certain cancers. The specificity of Rpd3S in recognizing acetylated lysine residues on histones posits this complex as a central player in the dynamic regulation of the epigenome, and underscores the necessity to further elucidate the full spectrum of its regulatory influences and potential as a target for epigenetic therapies.
