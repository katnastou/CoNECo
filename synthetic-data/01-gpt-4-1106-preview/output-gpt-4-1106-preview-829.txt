prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: EFF-1. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In the present study, we sought to elucidate the role of the EFF-1 protein complex in mediating cell fusion events during skin morphogenesis in *C. elegans*. The experimental approach involved a series of in vivo assays, where the spatial and temporal expression patterns of EFF-1 were characterized using fluorescent tagging and confocal microscopy. Live-imaging techniques revealed that EFF-1 localization peaked at the onset of hypodermal cell fusion, suggesting that the temporal regulation of this complex is critical for proper epidermal development. Subsequent pharmacological interventions using specific inhibitors of proteasome activity led to a pronounced decrease in EFF-1 levels, resulting in aberrant cell fusion phenotypes. This disruption was also noted to impair cuticle formation, implicating EFF-1's potential involvement in extracellular matrix assembly. Since cell fusion processes are similarly crucial in muscle development and placental morphogenesis in mammals, these findings may provide foundational insights into analogous mechanisms in higher organisms. Furthermore, the investigations signified the potential consequences of EFF-1 dysregulation in diseases characterized by defective cell fusion, such as certain myopathies and fusion-related developmental disorders. Collectively, our data underscore the centrality of the EFF-1 protein complex in developmental cell fusion events and pave the way for future therapeutic strategies targeting EFF-1 pathways in pathologies associated with its dysfunction.
