prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: BC3B. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In a recent study, the protein complex BC3B has been identified as a pivotal regulator in the apoptotic pathway of mammalian cells. Through a series of in vitro and in vivo experiments, it has been demonstrated that BC3B interacts with various apoptotic inhibitors, thereby modulating the intrinsic apoptosis mechanism in response to cellular stress signals. The research utilized mouse models to elucidate the role of BC3B in tissue homeostasis and its dysregulation in the pathogenesis of diseases like cancer. Chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry analysis allowed for the precise identification of post-translational modifications on BC3B, which appear to be critical for its interaction with mitochondrial membranes. Inhibition of BC3B via small molecules resulted in increased susceptibility to apoptosis, suggesting possible therapeutic applications in oncology. Further studies are required to understand the complex signaling pathways involving BC3B and its potential as a target for drug development, offering promising prospects for the treatment of apoptosis-related diseases.
