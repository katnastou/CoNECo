prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: glutamine amidotransferase II. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In an effort to elucidate the biochemical pathways implicated in nitrogen metabolism, recent investigations have focused on characterizing the activity of glutamine amidotransferase II within kidney tissue samples. This protein complex plays a pivotal role in catalyzing the transfer of an amide nitrogen from glutamine to a variety of substrates, a process that is essential for the biosynthesis of several key metabolites. The study sought to determine the kinetic parameters of glutamine amidotransferase II in the presence of varying concentrations of substrates and co-factors, revealing insights into its regulatory mechanisms. Furthermore, assessments of its activity in response to pathological conditions, such as chronic kidney disease, highlighted its potential as a therapeutic target. The analysis involved a quantitative assay utilizing mass spectrometry techniques to accurately measure reaction rates and product formation. The outcomes of these experiments provide substantive evidence that alterations in the function of glutamine amidotransferase II could be correlated with metabolic dysregulation observed in specific disease states, underpinning the importance of this protein complex in maintaining cellular homeostasis.
