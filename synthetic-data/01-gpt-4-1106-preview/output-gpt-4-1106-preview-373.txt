prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: VEGF-A. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: Recent advancements in the field of oncology have identified the VEGF-A protein complex as a pivotal factor in the modulation of angiogenesis within solid tumors. Through a series of in vitro experiments utilizing human endothelial cells, it was observed that the presence of this complex is intricately linked to the proliferation and migration of these cells towards a gradient of tumor-secreted factors. An analysis of murine models bearing xenografts further revealed that the inhibition of VEGF-A activity corresponded with a marked reduction in tumor vascularization, suggesting that this protein complex plays a critical role in the neovascularization process. Moreover, specific inhibitors targeting the interaction between VEGF-A and its receptors have shown promise in preclinical trials, yielding a decrease in the vascular density within the tumor microenvironment. This is especially relevant as the suppression of angiogenesis could potentially attenuate the delivery of nutrients and oxygen to neoplastic cells, thereby impeding tumor growth and metastasis. These findings raise the possibility of developing novel therapeutic strategies aimed at disrupting the function of VEGF-A, with the potential to improve the management and prognosis of patients suffering from various malignant diseases.
