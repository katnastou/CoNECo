prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: Tenascin-R. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we sought to elucidate the functional implications of Tenascin-R within the context of neurodegenerative diseases, with a particular emphasis on its role in the extracellular matrix of the central nervous system. The investigation was prompted by observations that alterations in the extracellular matrix can have profound effects on neuronal survival, synaptic plasticity, and regeneration. Utilizing a murine model of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), we observed a marked dysregulation in the expression of Tenascin-R alongside progressive motor neuron degeneration and gliosis. Biochemical assays revealed that Tenascin-R interacts with various extracellular signaling molecules such as growth factors and cytokines, which are critical in mediating inflammatory responses in the neural microenvironment. Immunohistochemical analyses demonstrated a pronounced reduction of Tenascin-R in the spinal cord as the disease advanced, suggesting a potential protective role for this protein complex in the maintenance of neural integrity. Therapeutic administration of a chemical compound designed to modulate Tenascin-R expression yielded a moderate but significant delay in ALS symptom onset, indicating a possible avenue for therapeutic intervention. These findings underscore the importance of Tenascin-R in the neural extracellular matrix and its potential as a target for therapeutic strategies aimed at mitigating the exacerbation of neurodegenerative processes.
