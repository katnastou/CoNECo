prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: Nup107-120. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we investigated the role of the Nup107-120 in the regulation of intracellular transport mechanisms, focusing on its potential impact on cellular homeostasis and disease pathogenesis. The Nup107-120 complex is a pivotal constituent of the nuclear pore complex (NPC), which serves as a gatekeeper for molecular traffic between the nucleus and cytoplasm. Our experiments employed several mammalian cell lines, including HeLa and HEK293, to elucidate the functional dynamics of Nup107-120 in the context of nucleocytoplasmic transport. Immunofluorescence microscopy and co-immunoprecipitation assays were employed to assess the localization and interaction of Nup107-120 with various transport receptors. Additionally, the effect of chemical inhibitors on the NPC function was observed, highlighting alterations in the nucleocytoplasmic gradient of signaling molecules, such as calcium ions, and their subsequent effects on cell cycle progression. Results from these studies suggest that the integrity of the Nup107-120 complex is crucial for maintaining the selective permeability of the NPC, and disruptions in this complex could contribute to the pathophysiology of diseases such as cancer and certain congenital disorders associated with nucleocytoplasmic trafficking defects.
