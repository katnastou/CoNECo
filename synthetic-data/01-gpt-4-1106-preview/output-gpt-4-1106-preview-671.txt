prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: Sus. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In a recent study, the role of the protein complex Sus in lipid metabolism has been elucidated, providing insights into its function within the hepatic cells of murine models. The study demonstrated that the presence of Sus is critical for the efficient processing of cholesterol, with implications for the development of atherosclerosis. Experimental groups, in which the complex was upregulated, exhibited a marked decrease in plasma triglyceride levels, suggesting that Sus influences lipid homeostasis. Furthermore, when the subjects were exposed to a high-fat diet, those with higher expression of Sus maintained a more stable lipid profile, indicating a potential protective role against diet-induced dyslipidemia. Cellular assays revealed that Sus facilitated the uptake and breakdown of fatty acids, thereby modulating the intracellular energy balance and affecting overall metabolism. The findings suggest that therapeutic strategies modulating the activity of Sus could be beneficial in the treatment of metabolic disorders characterized by abnormal lipid accumulation and usage, such as non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and diabetes mellitus. Future investigations are warranted to further dissect the mechanistic pathways involving Sus and to explore its potential as a biomarker for metabolic health.
