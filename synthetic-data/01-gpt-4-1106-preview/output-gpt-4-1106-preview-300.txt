prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: T6SS. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In a recent advancement within the field of molecular microbiology, the targeted suppression of pathogenic bacteria has been attributed to the expression of the Type VI secretion system (T6SS). This protein complex is a pivotal factor in the competitive interactions between bacterial species within polymicrobial environments. Specifically, through a mechanism reminiscent of a molecular syringe, the T6SS injects effector molecules directly into adjacent cells, often resulting in cellular disruption or death. Studies have demonstrated that the T6SS-mediated antagonism is of significant import in the regulation of microbial communities within the host, perturbing both commensal and pathogenic populations. In a vertebrate model, it was observed that the presence of this complex may play a critical role in shaping the outcomes of bacterial infections. Furthermore, T6SS has shown potential therapeutic promise; harnessing its effector delivery capabilities could lead to innovative strategies for the treatment of multidrug-resistant bacterial strains. Elucidation of the regulation and function of T6SS could enlighten our understanding of bacterial pathogenesis and symbiosis while offering novel targets for antimicrobial interventions.
