prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: RITS. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we investigated the role of chromatin remodeling in the regulation of gene expression in fission yeast, with a primary focus on the RNA-induced transcriptional silencing (RITS) complex. We employed chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by high-throughput sequencing (ChIP-seq) to elucidate the genome-wide distribution pattern of the RITS complex, revealing its preferential association with centromeric repeats and regions enriched in heterochromatin. Subsequent knockdown experiments indicated that reduced RITS complex activity leads to the derepression of transcripts normally silenced by heterochromatin-mediated mechanisms, impacting cell cycle progression and genomic stability. Importantly, the dysregulation of the RITS complex has been associated with aberrant RNA processing events, hinting at its possible involvement in the defense against viral elements and transposable elements. Additionally, pharmacological inhibition of the histone deacetylase activity resulted in perturbed interactions of the RITS complex with chromatin, further emphasizing its role in transcriptional control. This research offers new insights into how chromatin modifiers and the RITS complex synergize to maintain the epigenetic landscape and preserve cellular homeostasis, with potential implications for understanding the molecular basis of diseases characterized by chromatin dysregulation.
