prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: HEX B. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In the recent study conducted to elucidate the role of HEX B in the progression of Tay-Sachs disease, we observed that the deficiency in this protein complex leads to an aberrant accumulation of GM2 ganglioside within neuronal cells. Our research involved a cohort of murine models with a phenotypic presentation similar to the human pathology. We analyzed enzymatic activity in various tissue homogenates and compared the findings to control samples. Upon quantification, we detected a significant reduction of HEX B activity in the affected cohort, consistent with the phenotype observed. Furthermore, we explored the potential therapeutic implications of substrate reduction therapy (SRT), hypothesizing that this approach may ameliorate the disease phenotype by compensating for HEX B insufficiency. Initial results indicated a partial reduction in GM2 ganglioside levels, suggesting a promising avenue for further investigation. The findings underscore the critical function of HEX B in lysosomal degradation and its impact on cellular homeostasis. Future studies are warranted to delve deeper into the mechanisms by which HEX B dysregulation contributes to neurodegenerative disease and to explore the full potential of SRT in restoring metabolic balance in the absence of functional HEX B.
