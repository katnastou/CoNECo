prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: GGTase-I. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: Recent studies have identified GGTase-I as a pivotal modulator in the intricate network of protein prenylation, a crucial post-translational modification whereby lipid groups are covalently attached to target proteins, facilitating their membrane association and subsequent cellular functions. Given its recognized role, GGTase-I has been implicated in the pathogenesis of numerous diseases, including certain cancers and neurodegenerative disorders. The enzymatic activity of GGTase-I primarily involves the attachment of geranylgeranyl groups to the C-terminus of substrate proteins, a reaction that necessitates the presence of divalent metal ions such as Mg2+ as cofactors. In this context, small molecule inhibitors targeting GGTase-I have been synthesized, underscoring the therapeutic potential of modulating this complex to ameliorate disease phenotypes. Recent experiments utilizing murine models have demonstrated that systemic administration of these inhibitors can lead to noticeable alterations in cell proliferation and apoptosis, pinpointing the essential role of GGTase-I in regulating cell cycle and survival. Moreover, given the ubiquitous nature of protein prenylation, the targeting of GGTase-I also offers clues into a broader spectrum of cellular processes, including signal transduction, cytoskeletal dynamics, and vesicular trafficking. Thus, GGTase-I stands as a nodal point in the cellular machinery, and its study offers promising avenues for both the understanding of fundamental biological mechanisms and the development of novel pharmacological strategies.
