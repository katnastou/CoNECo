prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: KAR. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In a recent landmark study, the kinetics of the KAR protein complex were scrutinized to better understand its role in signaling pathways relevant to cellular apoptosis. Investigations into the structural conformation of KAR utilized advanced cryo-electron microscopy techniques, which provided novel insights into its spatial orientation within different cell types, including HeLa cells and primary neurons. The functional assays, conducted meticulously over a series of time-lapse studies, revealed that the activity of KAR fluctuates in response to oxidative stress, indicating its potential regulatory function in redox homeostasis. Moreover, in vivo experiments using a murine model of neurodegeneration demonstrated that modulation of KAR activity corresponds to alterations in disease progression, highlighting its therapeutic relevance. The pharmacological profiles of a panel of small-molecule inhibitors targeting KAR uncovered a promising candidate that ameliorates symptoms in a zebrafish model of metabolic disorder, providing a preliminary framework for drug development. The implications of these findings suggest that KAR is a critical molecular junction in pathways implicated in both normal cellular function and disease pathology, warranting further investigation into its mechanism of action and potential as a drug target.
