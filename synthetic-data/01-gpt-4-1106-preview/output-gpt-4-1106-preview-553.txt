prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: ABAT. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In the recent study published by the International Journal of Molecular Sciences, researchers have explicated the intricate role of ABAT in cerebral amino acid metabolism. The study explored the impact of altered ABAT functional dynamics on neurotransmitter regulation, demonstrating that deviations in ABAT activity could precipitate significant disruptions in the homeostatic balance of the brain. By conducting a series of in vivo experiments utilizing murine models, the researchers administered various exogenous compounds known to interact with central nervous system pathways, charting the subsequent physiological responses. Notably, a marked upregulation in glutamate levels was observed following ABAT inhibition, providing insights into potential therapeutic targets for neurological disorders such as epilepsy. Furthermore, metabolomic profiling revealed that ABAT plays a crucial part in the catabolism of specific amino acids, with consequences for cellular energy production. These findings underscore ABAT's pivotal role within metabolic networks and its potential as a novel point of intervention for metabolic encephalopathies.
