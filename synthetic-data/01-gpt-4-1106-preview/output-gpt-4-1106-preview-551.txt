prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: 60S ribosomal subunit. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we investigated the potential therapeutic effects of a novel antitumor compound on non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cellular models by assessing its impact on protein synthesis machinery. Of particular interest was the interaction of the compound with the 60S ribosomal subunit, a critical component of the eukaryotic ribosome responsible for peptide bond formation during translation. Upon exposure to the compound, NSCLC cells demonstrated a significant decrease in translational fidelity, accompanied by reduced proliferation rates. Immunoprecipitation followed by mass spectrometry confirmed direct binding of the compound to the 60S ribosomal subunit, elucidating the mechanism behind the observed cytostatic effect. Subsequent in vivo studies in a murine xenograft model revealed that systemic administration of the compound resulted in tumour growth inhibition, showcasing the 60S ribosomal subunit as a viable target for cancer chemotherapy. These findings reveal a promising avenue for the development of novel therapeutics that modulate the function of the 60S ribosomal subunit to combat malignancies.
