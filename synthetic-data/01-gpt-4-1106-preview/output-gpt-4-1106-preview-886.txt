prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: Tenascin-C. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: Tenascin-C, an extracellular matrix glycoprotein, has been implicated in multiple physiological processes such as cell adhesion, migration, and proliferation, which are crucial for tissue development and repair. Recent investigations have elucidated the role of Tenascin-C in pathological conditions, including cancer progression and fibrotic diseases. This multifaceted protein complex modulates the tumor microenvironment, influencing cancer cell behavior and potentially altering the patient's immune response. Furthermore, in myocardial infarction models, Tenascin-C expression is significantly upregulated, contributing to the cardiac remodeling process. Innovative therapeutic strategies to modulate Tenascin-C are being explored, with the aim of attenuating fibrosis and improving tissue regeneration. Current in vivo studies, using murine models, have demonstrated that targeted manipulation of Tenascin-C can substantially affect wound healing rates, suggesting potential clinical applications in enhancing tissue repair mechanisms. Concomitantly, research endeavors are focusing on deciphering the molecular pathways by which Tenascin-C exerts its effects on various cell types within pathological lesions to pave the way for novel drug discovery.
