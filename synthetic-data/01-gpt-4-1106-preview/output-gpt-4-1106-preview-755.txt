prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: BAP. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In a landmark study examining the role of the BAP complex in cellular repair mechanisms, we aimed to elucidate the specific function of BAP in DNA damage response pathways. Cultured murine fibroblasts treated with ultraviolet radiation exhibited an upregulation of BAP, suggesting a potential involvement in the repair of UV-induced DNA lesions. Subsequent experiments employing small molecule inhibitors of the ATM kinase revealed a reduction in BAP complex activation, indicating a correlation between ATM signaling and BAP-mediated repair processes. Further, biochemical assays demonstrated that BAP possesses ubiquitin ligase activity, implicating it in the ubiquitination events that facilitate the recruitment of repair machinery to damaged chromatin regions. In in vivo experiments, mice deficient in BAP displayed heightened sensitivity to ionizing radiation, developing symptoms consistent with a compromised DNA damage response, such as increased mutagenesis and susceptibility to cancer. Collectively, these observations suggest that BAP plays a critical role in maintaining genomic stability and protecting organisms from genotoxic stress, marking it as a potential target for therapeutic intervention in diseases characterized by defective DNA repair mechanisms.
