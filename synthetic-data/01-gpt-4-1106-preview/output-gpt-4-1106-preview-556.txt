prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: PA28. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In a recent investigation, researchers have unveiled novel insights into the immunoproteasome regulator, PA28, and its critical role in modulating proteasomal activity under oxidative stress. Extensive in vitro analysis showed that the presence of PA28 significantly enhanced the degradation of oxidized proteins, thus preventing accumulation of potentially cytotoxic aggregates. Moreover, in vivo studies using murine models subjected to systemic oxidative stress revealed that tissues expressing higher levels of PA28 exhibited a marked decrease in proteotoxic injury. This proteoprotection was notably absent in control organisms lacking adequate PA28 upregulation. Further biochemical assays confirmed that PA28 directly interacts with the 20S proteasome, facilitating the ATP-independent recognition and elimination of oxidatively-damaged substrates. Taken together, these observations underscore the importance of PA28 in cellular proteostasis, especially during oxidative challenges that could lead to pathological conditions such as neurodegeneration or chronic inflammation. The therapeutic potential of modulating PA28 in diseases characterized by impaired protein clearance mechanisms represents a promising avenue for pharmaceutical intervention.
