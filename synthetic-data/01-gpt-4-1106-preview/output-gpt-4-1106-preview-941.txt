prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: IL-1 receptor. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In recent investigations into the molecular mechanisms underpinning inflammatory responses, considerable attention has been directed towards the IL-1 receptor and its role in signaling pathways. The interaction of this receptor with its ligands has been demonstrated to play a pivotal role in modulating cellular responses to inflammatory stimuli in both murine models and human tissues. For instance, studies involving human peripheral blood mononuclear cells have shown that upon activation by its specific agonists, the IL-1 receptor initiates a cascade of intracellular signaling events that culminate in the transcription of genes involved in the inflammatory response. Pharmacological inhibition of the IL-1 receptor has yielded promising therapeutic effects in conditions characterized by excessive inflammation, such as rheumatoid arthritis and psoriasis. Notably, examination of receptor-ligand binding affinity and the subsequent downstream effects has shed light on potential allosteric modulators that could fine-tune receptor activity. Moreover, investigations into the post-translational modifications of the IL-1 receptor have revealed insights into the temporal control of signaling specificity and intensity, which is thought to be crucial for balancing the beneficial and detrimental aspects of the inflammatory response in various pathological settings.
