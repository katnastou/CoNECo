prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: mitochondrial editosome. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we explored the role of the mitochondrial editosome in the pathogenesis of Leigh syndrome, a severe neurological disorder. Recent evidence suggests that aberrations in mitochondrial RNA processing contribute to the disease phenotype. To investigate this hypothesis, we analyzed mitochondrial RNA profiles in patient-derived fibroblasts lacking a functional mitochondrial editosome. We employed high-throughput sequencing and subsequent bioinformatic analyses to assess the spectrum of RNA modifications and editing events. Our results demonstrate a significant alteration in the pattern of mitochondrial RNA processing in cells deficient in the mitochondrial editosome, correlated with impaired mitochondrial function and increased oxidative stress markers. This dysregulation of RNA editing was associated with a decrease in the production of key respiratory chain subunits, corroborating the hypothesis that the mitochondrial editosome plays a vital role in maintaining mitochondrial energy metabolism. Our study offers a novel insight into the mechanistic link between RNA processing defects and mitochondrial dysfunction in Leigh syndrome, suggesting that the mitochondrial editosome may represent a potential therapeutic target for the management of mitochondrial diseases.
