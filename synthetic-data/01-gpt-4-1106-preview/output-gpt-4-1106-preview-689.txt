prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: gamma-secretases. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In recent years, considerable research efforts have been devoted to elucidating the molecular mechanisms underlying Alzheimer's disease, with particular focus on the role of gamma-secretases. This multifaceted protein complex is integral to the proteolytic processing of amyloid precursor protein (APP), a critical event in the formation of amyloid-beta (Aβ) peptides that are hallmarks of the disease pathology. Accumulation of these Aβ peptides in the neuronal tissue leads to the formation of amyloid plaques, which are associated with neurodegeneration and cognitive decline. Pharmacological modulation of gamma-secretases has been proposed as a therapeutic strategy, aiming to reduce the generation of the pathogenic Aβ42 isoform while preserving the physiological processing of other substrates. Recent studies involving mouse models have highlighted the necessity of understanding the complex interplay between this protein complex and various factors such as substrate availability, post-translational modifications, and cellular localization to develop efficacious treatments with minimal off-target effects. Thus, targeting gamma-secretases stands as a promising, albeit challenging, avenue in the pursuit of disease-modifying therapies for Alzheimer's disease.
