prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2B. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The regulation of protein synthesis in eukaryotic organisms is a critical aspect of cellular function and response to environmental stimuli. A pivotal player in this regulatory network is the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2B (eIF2B), which catalyzes the exchange of GDP for GTP on its target, eIF2, thereby playing a crucial role in the initiation phase of translation. Perturbations in the activity of eIF2B have been implicated in a variety of human diseases, including Vanishing White Matter disease, underscoring its significance in the maintenance of cellular homeostasis. In this study, we sought to elucidate the mechanisms by which eIF2B activity is modulated under conditions of oxidative stress, a common challenge faced by cells. Using a combination of biochemical assays and live-cell imaging, we observed that oxidative stress leads to a reversible conformational change in eIF2B. This alteration was correlated with a decrease in protein synthesis rates, which was concomitant with increased cellular levels of reactive oxygen species. Moreover, our findings suggest that the presence of certain antioxidants can mitigate the impact of oxidative stress on eIF2B function, revealing potential therapeutic avenues for diseases characterized by dysfunctional protein synthesis.
