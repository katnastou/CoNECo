prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: eNoSc. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In a groundbreaking study, the functional implications of the eNoSc protein complex within the context of cellular senescence were elucidated. Upon utilizing a combination of confocal microscopy and immunoprecipitation techniques, we observed a pronounced colocalization of eNoSc with markers of autophagic vesicles in senescent human fibroblasts. Interestingly, eNoSc's dynamics appeared to be modulated by the cellular concentration of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+), suggesting a potential crosstalk between metabolic processes and protein complex function. Chronic exposure of these fibroblasts to sub-lethal doses of hydrogen peroxide mimicked the oxidative stress condition commonly associated with ageing, further enhancing the prominence of eNoSc within the senescent phenotype. Therapeutic strategies targeting the modulation of eNoSc activity may offer a novel approach to mitigating the deleterious effects of ageing and age-related diseases such as Alzheimer's disease and type 2 diabetes. The precise mechanistic underpinnings of eNoSc's role in regulating cellular homeostasis, however, warrant further investigation.
