prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: MalFGK(2). Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we investigated the transport efficiency of the MalFGK(2) protein complex, a critical component of the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter system in Escherichia coli, and its role in the translocation of maltose under various substrate concentration gradients. The kinetic parameters of the MalFGK(2)-mediated transport were quantified using radiolabeled maltose, revealing a high specificity and affinity for its substrates. We employed a series of assays, including ATP hydrolysis measurements and transport assays in membrane vesicles, to analyze the functionality of MalFGK(2) under different ionic and pH conditions. The resulting data suggested that the efficiency of maltose transport is significantly influenced by the presence of sodium ions, which correlated with an increase in the ATPase activity of MalFGK(2). Furthermore, site-directed mutagenesis of the protein complex revealed that certain amino acid residues are vital for maintaining structural integrity and function. Our results have implications for understanding the molecular mechanisms of nutrient uptake in bacteria, with potential applications in developing novel antibiotics targeting bacterial ABC transporters. This study contributes to the broader field of microbial metabolism and its regulation, which is integral to addressing challenges related to pathogenic bacterial resistance.
