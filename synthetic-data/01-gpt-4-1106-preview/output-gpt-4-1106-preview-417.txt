prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: CD42. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In a recent study, the functional characterization of the protein complex CD42 and its role in thrombocyte aggregation was examined to elucidate its implications in thrombotic disorders. Utilizing a combination of co-immunoprecipitation and mass spectrometry, the interactions between CD42 and various signaling molecules were assessed in human plasma under conditions mimicking hemostatic activation. The research revealed that CD42 exhibits a high affinity for binding partners implicated in the coagulation cascade, suggesting an integral role in the modulation of thrombin generation. To substantiate the physiological relevance of these findings, murine models with induced thrombosis were utilized, where the deficiency of CD42 resulted in a pronounced delay in arterial thrombus formation. In addition, patients with a history of ischemic stroke presented with significantly altered levels of CD42, further underscoring its potential as a biomarker for prothrombotic states. The culmination of these observations posits CD42 as a pivotal player in thrombocyte function, and invites further exploration into its therapeutic targeting for the management of thrombosis-related diseases.
