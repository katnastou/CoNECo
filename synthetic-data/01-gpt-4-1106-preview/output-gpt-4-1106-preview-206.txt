prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: ABC lipid flippase MsbA. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we explored the role of the ABC lipid flippase MsbA in maintaining lipid asymmetry within the phospholipid bilayers of Escherichia coli. Through a series of in vitro assays, we observed that the inhibition of ABC lipid flippase MsbA activity led to a marked increase in the outward translocation of phosphatidylethanolamine, suggesting a critical function of this protein complex in the biogenesis of membrane vesicles. Moreover, the viability assays conducted under stress conditions indicative of outer membrane destabilization, such as exposure to high concentrations of vancomycin, demonstrated a significant decrease in cell survival for MsbA-inhibited populations. This underscores the potential consequences of disrupted lipid trafficking on bacterial resistance mechanisms. The implications of this research are manifold, considering the current interest in targeting ABC lipid flippase MsbA as a novel antibacterial strategy. By delineating the exact molecular interplay between MsbA and the lipidome within pathogenic bacteria, we aim to contribute to the development of therapies that selectively impair microbial defense without affecting host membrane integrity. Our findings establish a foundational understanding of the mechanistic intricacies beneath the critical life-sustaining processes governed by ABC lipid flippase MsbA.
