prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: KFRC. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we have identified a novel protein complex, designated KFRC, which appears to play a crucial role in the cellular response to oxidative stress. Upon exposure to increased concentrations of hydrogen peroxide, cells exhibiting overexpression of KFRC demonstrated a significant resilience compared to control cells. This enhanced resistance to oxidative damage suggests a potential protective mechanism against reactive oxygen species-induced apoptosis. In vivo experiments using murine models confirmed that tissues with elevated levels of KFRC exhibit a marked reduction in markers of oxidative stress, such as lipid peroxidation and DNA damage, particularly in the liver and brain, which are highly susceptible to oxidative insults. Additionally, preliminary data indicates that KFRC may be involved in the modulation of autophagic pathways, with implications for age-related disorders such as Alzheimer's disease. While the exact mechanism by which KFRC affords cellular protection remains to be elucidated, our results position KFRC as a promising target for therapeutic intervention in diseases characterized by oxidative stress and impaired cellular homeostasis.
