prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: MsbA transporter. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In a recent study aimed at elucidating the mechanisms of lipid A transport across the inner membrane of Gram-negative bacteria, the role of the MsbA transporter was investigated through a combination of biochemical assays and structural analyses. The MsbA transporter, an ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter, is essential for the flipping of lipid A from the inner to the outer leaflet of the inner membrane, a critical step in the biosynthesis of lipopolysaccharide (LPS), which is a principal component of the outer membrane. Dysregulation of this process can be detrimental to bacterial survival and has been implicated in the onset of antibiotic resistance. Fluorescently labeled lipid A derivatives were employed in this study to monitor the activity of the MsbA transporter in real-time. The findings suggest that the transport activity is coupled with ATP hydrolysis, and mutations within the nucleotide-binding domains significantly reduced the efficacy of transport. Additionally, the study provided insights into how various pharmacological inhibitors, such as macrolides, could block the function of the MsbA transporter, potentially paving the way for novel antimicrobial therapies targeting resistant strains of pathogens like Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, which have been associated with severe infections in immunocompromised patients. Concluding, the MsbA transporter remains a promising target for antibiotic development, with inhibitor design informed by a deeper understanding of its structure and transport mechanism.
