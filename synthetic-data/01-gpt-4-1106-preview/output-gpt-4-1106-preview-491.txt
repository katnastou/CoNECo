prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: Polymerase-zeta. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: Recent advances in the elucidation of DNA repair mechanisms have shed light on the critical role of Polymerase-zeta in the bypass of DNA lesions during the replication process. In an effort to understand the molecular dynamics underpinning this mechanism, a series of experiments were conducted using murine models with elevated levels of UV-induced pyrimidine dimers. The results indicated that Polymerase-zeta is indispensable for translesion synthesis, facilitating the continuation of DNA synthesis past these cytotoxic lesions. Notably, the fidelity of this process was quantified by assessing mutation rates in somatic cells post-replication, revealing an intricate balance managed by Polymerase-zeta between genomic stability and tolerable mutagenesis. Furthermore, pharmacological inhibition of Polymerase-zeta via small-molecule inhibitors resulted in an exacerbated sensitivity to DNA-damaging agents, suggesting potential therapeutic applications for cancers with compromised DNA repair pathways. These findings underscore the complex yet pivotal role of Polymerase-zeta in maintaining cellular integrity in the face of genotoxic stress, with implications for both oncogenesis and the development of novel cancer treatments.
