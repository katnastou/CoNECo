prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: VPS4A/B. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: Recent studies have elucidated the pivotal role of the VPS4A/B protein complex in the modulation of endosomal trafficking pathways, which are crucial for the homeostatic regulation of eukaryotic cells. The VPS4A/B complex, through its ATPase activity, mediates the disassembly of ESCRT-III complexes, a process imperative for the recycling of vesicular components and the successful abscission of membrane-bound vesicles, including those implicated in the degradation of cellular debris. Disruption of VPS4A/B function has been associated with aberrant multivesicular body (MVB) formation and consequential pathological states. For instance, in neuron-derived cells, the impairment of VPS4A/B has been correlated with an accumulation of autophagosomes, suggesting a potential link between VPS4A/B dysfunction and the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative disorders. Moreover, the therapeutic potential of modulating VPS4A/B activity has been accentuated by findings from targeted pharmacological interventions in animal models of cancer, where the attenuation of metastatic progression has been observed. These observations reinforce the significance of VPS4A/B in maintaining cellular integrity and provide a framework for future research targeting this complex in disease amelioration and therapeutic development.
