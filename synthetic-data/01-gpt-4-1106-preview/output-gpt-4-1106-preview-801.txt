prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: ExoVII. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In the recent study published in the *Journal of Cellular Biochemistry*, researchers have delineated the role of the protein complex ExoVII in DNA repair mechanisms. The team used mouse embryonic fibroblast cells to investigate the incidence of single-strand breaks (SSBs) upon the induced downregulation of ExoVII. The results were indicative of a substantial increase in DNA lesions compared to the control group, suggesting a critical involvement of ExoVII in the maintenance of genomic stability. Further immunoassay analysis demonstrated that the depletion of ExoVII led to an augmentation of cellular reactive oxygen species (ROS), culminating in oxidative stress, which is known to exacerbate DNA damage. Interestingly, subsequent treatment with the antioxidant N-acetylcysteine ameliorated the observed increase in DNA breaks, highlighting a potential avenue for therapeutic intervention in diseases perturbed by oxidative DNA damage. This groundbreaking study not only underscores the pivotal role of ExoVII in SSB repair but also paves the way for future research into its utility as a biomarker for oxidative stress-related pathologies.
