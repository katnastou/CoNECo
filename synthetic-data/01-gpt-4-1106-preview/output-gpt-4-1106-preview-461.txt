prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: vacuolar HOPS. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In the current study, we have elucidated the role of the vacuolar HOPS complex in autophagy regulation within Saccharomyces cerevisiae under nitrogen starvation conditions. Upon induction of autophagy, it was observed that the vacuolar HOPS complex facilitates the docking and fusion of autophagosomes with the vacuole membrane, a critical step for the degradation of autophagic cargo. Intriguingly, our results demonstrate that the presence of the vacuolar HOPS complex is not merely contributory but essential, as loss-of-function mutations led to marked accumulation of autophagosomes, signifying a blockade in autophagosome-vacuole fusion. Furthermore, pharmacological inhibition of the vacuolar HOPS complex using a small molecule inhibitor specifically designed to disrupt its activity corroborated these genetic findings. Thus, our research provides compelling evidence that the vacuolar HOPS complex is a pivotal component of the autophagic machinery, advancing our understanding of how cellular homeostasis is maintained under conditions of nutrient stress, with implications for understanding the molecular pathology of lysosomal storage disorders.
