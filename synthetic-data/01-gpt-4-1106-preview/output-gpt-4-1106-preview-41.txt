prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: ADDL. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: Recent evidence suggests that the aggregation of the protein complex ADDL (Amyloid Î²-Derived Diffusible Ligands) is closely associated with the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). In a controlled laboratory setting, neuronal cultures exposed to ADDL demonstrated synaptic loss and decreased synaptic plasticity, which are indicative of early neurotoxic effects. Furthermore, investigations using in vivo models have shown an increase in the concentration of ADDL in the brains of affected subjects, correlating with disease progression and severity. The precise mechanism by which ADDL exerts its neurotoxic effects appears to involve the disruption of calcium ion homeostasis and the initiation of a cascade of oxidative stress responses within neuronal cells. Therapeutic strategies, now in development, aim to interrupt the interaction of ADDL with neuronal synapses, potentially halting or reversing the cognitive decline observed in patients with AD. The implication of such findings underscores the importance of early detection and the targeting of ADDL in therapeutic modalities, which could lead to significant advances in the management of this debilitating disease.
