prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: 20S core. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In recent studies, the proteolytic activities of the 20S core within the proteasome pathway have garnered significant attention due to their implications in various cellular processes and diseases. Notably, aberrant regulation of the 20S core has been linked to the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative disorders, underscoring the necessity for a deeper understanding of its role in protein degradation. In an investigative series of assays, we observed that the enzymatic function of the 20S core is markedly influenced by oxidative stress, a condition prevalent in the neuronal demise characterizing Alzheimer's disease. Furthermore, the application of cellular models has demonstrated that the 20S core maintains an intrinsic ability to recognize and degrade misfolded proteins, a mechanism that is potentially compromised under pathological conditions. Therapeutic approaches targeting the stabilization and enhancement of 20S core activity have, thus, emerged as a promising avenue for the amelioration of proteostasis-related diseases. The specificity of these approaches offers an advantage over traditional broad-spectrum proteasome inhibitors, such as bortezomib, which non-selectively impede proteolytic pathways and are associated with a plethora of side effects. Future investigations are warranted to elucidate the precise regulatory mechanisms governing the 20S core under both physiological and pathological conditions to pave the way for novel clinical interventions.
