prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: HOPS. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In the present study, we have investigated the functional role of the HOPS complex in intracellular trafficking and its implications in lysosomal storage disorders. The HOPS complex is paramount in the fusion of lysosomes with late endosomes, a critical step in maintaining cellular homeostasis. We employed both in vitro and in vivo models to elucidate the mechanistic pathways involving HOPS-mediated membrane tethering and fusion. Our data suggest that the HOPS complex is indispensable for the efficient degradation of autophagosomes, and its dysfunction leads to an accumulation of undegraded substrates, characteristic of lysosomal storage disorders. In particular, we observed that cells lacking adequate HOPS activity exhibited hallmarks of neurodegenerative diseases, such as increased levels of Î±-synuclein and ubiquitin-positive inclusions. These observations imply that the HOPS complex may hold therapeutic potential for the treatment of lysosomal storage disorders and related neurodegenerative diseases. Further chemical screening identified several small molecules that enhance HOPS function and ameliorate disease phenotypes in murine models, thereby opening new avenues for drug development. Our findings underscore the critical role of HOPS in cellular physiology and disease pathology, offering novel insights into the molecular underpinnings of lysosomal function.
