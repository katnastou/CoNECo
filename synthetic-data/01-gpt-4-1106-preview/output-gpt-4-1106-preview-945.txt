prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: IL-23 receptor. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The IL-23 receptor plays a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of various autoimmune disorders. Emerging research indicates that the interaction of this receptor with its cognate ligand, interleukin-23, initiates a cascade of intracellular signaling pathways that promote the differentiation and expansion of Th17 cells, a subset of T helper cells implicated in immune-mediated inflammation. Recent clinical studies have demonstrated elevated levels of the IL-23 receptor in patients with psoriasis and inflammatory bowel disease, suggesting a direct correlation with disease severity and the therapeutic potential of targeting this receptor. Pharmacological interventions aiming to antagonize the IL-23 receptor have shown promise in ameliorating symptoms and altering the course of these chronic conditions. Furthermore, murine models deficient in the IL-23 receptor exhibit resistance to the induction of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, underscoring the receptor's importance in neuroinflammation and its potential as a target for multiple sclerosis treatment. These findings underscore the necessity for continued investigation into the molecular mechanisms governing IL-23 receptor signaling and its implications for therapeutic development.
