prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: 5-HT-3 receptor. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In the current study, we sought to elucidate the pharmacological modulation of the 5-HT-3 receptor in the context of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV). This receptor subtype is a ligand-gated ion channel prominently involved in the emetic reflex pathway. A diverse cohort of small molecule antagonists was screened for their inhibitory effect on the 5-HT-3 receptor activity in a cell-based assay. Serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine), the endogenous ligand, served as the control agonist. Induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived neuronal cultures expressing the 5-HT-3 receptor were utilized to mimic a physiologically relevant environment. Binding affinity and subsequent ion flux assays were used to determine antagonist potency. Electrophysiological recordings corroborated the findings, with diminished current amplitude being indicative of effective receptor blockade. In vivo, murine models were administered anticancer agents known to precipitate CINV, and the efficacy of the most potent 5-HT-3 receptor antagonists was assessed. Reduction in the frequency of emetic episodes compared to control groups established a benchmark for therapeutic potential. The investigation of side-effect profiles suggested minimal off-target activity within the central nervous system. These discoveries underscore the therapeutic relevance of the 5-HT-3 receptor and its antagonists in the management of CINV, enhancing patient quality of life during oncological treatment regimens.
