prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: IL-35. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In the quest to elucidate the immunomodulatory pathways implicated in autoimmune diseases, IL-35 has emerged as a cytokine of significant interest. Recent experiments have demonstrated that the administration of IL-35 not only ameliorates symptoms in murine models of multiple sclerosis but also promotes the proliferation of regulatory T cells, thereby fostering an anti-inflammatory milieu. This protein complex exhibits a pronounced effect on the cytokine milieu, skewing it towards an anti-inflammatory profile, which could have substantial implications for the therapeutic management of chronic inflammatory conditions. Moreover, the specificity of IL-35's interaction with immune effector cells makes it a promising candidate for targeted therapy. Studies employing knockout mice deficient in IL-35 production have further substantiated its role in maintaining immune homeostasis, as these animals exhibit exacerbated inflammatory responses when subjected to experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis. These findings suggest that IL-35 is pivotal in the delicate balance of immune responses and may hold the key to novel interventions in the treatment of autoimmune disorders. Thus, the advancement of research initiatives focused on IL-35 could potentially lead to breakthroughs in mitigating the progression of immune-mediated diseases.
