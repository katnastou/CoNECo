prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: HIUH. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In the current study, we sought to elucidate the functional role of the protein complex HIUH in cellular metabolism under oxidative stress conditions. Initial bioassays revealed that the presence of HIUH markedly enhanced the survival rates of Saccharomyces cerevisiae when exposed to hydrogen peroxide, suggesting a potential antioxidative function. Subsequent in vitro experiments using purified HIUH under controlled conditions demonstrated its ability to catalyze the reduction of reactive oxygen species, further supporting its putative role in cellular defense mechanisms against oxidative damage. Investigation into the downstream effects of HIUH activity showed an increase in the cellular levels of glutathione, a major antioxidant, implying that HIUH may play a pivotal role in modulating redox homeostasis. To scrutinize the physiological relevance of these findings, a mammalian model was employed, where tissue-specific overexpression of HIUH correlated with enhanced tolerance to ischemia-reperfusion injury, a pathological state characterized by oxidative stress. Collectively, these results underscore the significance of HIUH in the maintenance of cellular integrity under conditions of oxidative challenge and positions it as a potential target for therapeutic intervention in diseases associated with oxidative stress.
