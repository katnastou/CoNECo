prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: surface IgE. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In a recent study, the role of the immune response in the pathogenesis of allergic asthma was further elucidated, with specific attention given to the interaction between surface IgE and environmental allergens. Upon exposure to common allergens, individuals with a predisposition to atopic conditions demonstrated an elevated expression of surface IgE on mast cells and basophils, it is a crucial factor in the allergic cascade. This protein complex is known to bind allergens with high affinity, leading to cross-linking and subsequent cell degranulation. This process results in the release of inflammatory mediators such as histamine, leukotrienes, and prostaglandins, which contribute to the characteristic symptoms of asthma, including bronchoconstriction, airway hyperresponsiveness, and mucus production. Therapeutic interventions aimed at blocking the binding of allergens to surface IgE, or at downregulating the expression of surface IgE, have shown promise in mitigating the severity of asthmatic responses. Current research is focused on deciphering the molecular pathways that regulate the expression of surface IgE, in hopes of developing targeted therapies that could provide relief to patients with allergic asthma and potentially other atopic disorders.
