prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: Nup82. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The Nup82 complex has generated considerable interest within the scientific community due to its integral role in nucleocytoplasmic transport, a process imperative for maintaining cellular homeostasis. Through rigorous experimentation utilizing various biochemical assays, it was elucidated that the presence of Nup82 is critical for the efficient translocation of macromolecules across the nuclear envelope. Recent studies conducted on Saccharomyces cerevisiae models have shown that disruptions in the normal function of Nup82 lead to a marked decrease in mRNA export, corroborating the hypothesis of its pivotal function in the export pathway. In addition, in vitro experimentation with purified Nup82 complexes has demonstrated its potential involvement in the pathogenesis of certain cancers. More specifically, the aberrant expression of Nup82 has been implicated in the deregulation of cellular proliferation signals, highlighting a putative therapeutic target for oncological interventions. Furthermore, advanced imaging techniques have revealed the intricate architecture of the Nup82 complex, providing insight into its interaction with the nuclear pore complex and offering a structural basis for potential antineoplastic drugs designed to modulate its activity. As such, the study of Nup82 not only advances our understanding of cellular transport mechanisms but also holds promise for the development of novel therapeutic strategies against diseases characterized by dysfunctional nuclear transport.
