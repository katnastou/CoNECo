prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: PAN. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In the recent study by Zhao et al., the functional dynamics of the PAN protein complex within the broader cellular context were meticulously explored. The research utilized a combination of cryo-electron microscopy and in vitro biochemical assays to analyze the structural integrity and activity modulation of PAN under different physiological conditions. Results indicated that the binding affinity of PAN to ATP directly correlates with its role in protein homeostasis, suggesting that ATP-driven structural rearrangements facilitate substrate processing efficiency. Moreover, an investigation into the role of PAN in the presence of oxidative stress revealed an upregulation of activity, thereby implicating this complex in the cellular response to environmental challenges. Notably, the study found that the PAN-mediated response exhibited tissue specificity in Mus musculus models, with pronounced activity observed in hepatic cells, which may offer insights into the underlying mechanisms of liver-associated pathologies. Furthermore, the therapeutic potential of modulating PAN activity in the context of neurodegenerative disorders was highlighted, as aberrant protein aggregation is a hallmark of many such diseases. This research, though preliminary, opens avenues for the targeted manipulation of PAN in disease states characterized by proteostasis imbalance.
