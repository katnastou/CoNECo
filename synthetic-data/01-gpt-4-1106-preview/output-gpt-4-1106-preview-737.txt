prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: CRL4. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: Recent advances in our understanding of ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis have elucidated the pivotal role of the CRL4 complex within the cellular milieu. This E3 ubiquitin ligase plays an integral role in various cellular processes, including DNA repair, cell cycle regulation, and signal transduction. Dysfunction in CRL4 has been increasingly associated with the pathogenesis of several malignancies, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target. In a groundbreaking study, targeted inhibition of CRL4 demonstrated substantial antiproliferative effects in cancer cell lines, particularly in the context of non-small cell lung cancer. The specificity of CRL4 binding affinity was characterized using a battery of small molecules, with one leading candidate showing a marked decrease in tumor viability through the induction of apoptosis. Additionally, in vivo models of colorectal cancer revealed that systemic administration of the inhibitor resulted in a significant reduction in tumor burden without exhibiting overt toxicity, suggesting a favorable therapeutic index. Collectively, these findings not only underscore the importance of the CRL4 complex in tumorigenesis but also pave the way for the development of novel anticancer agents that exploit the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. Further investigations are warranted to fully delineate the regulatory mechanisms governing CRL4 activity and its interactions with other cellular pathways, offering promising avenues for precision medicine.
