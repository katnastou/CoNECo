prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: NendoUs. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In recent years, extensive research has been devoted to understanding the intricate mechanisms of DNA repair, and among the protein complexes involved, NendoUs has gained significant attention due to its unique role in the maintenance of genomic stability. In this study, we sought to elucidate the molecular functions of NendoUs in response to oxidative stress, a condition known to induce a plethora of DNA lesions. Using a combination of in vitro biochemical assays and in vivo models, including both murine subjects and human cell lines, we observed that the presence of NendoUs is critical for the effective repair of single-strand breaks (SSBs) often resulting from exposure to reactive oxygen species (ROS). Furthermore, our data suggest that the absence of NendoUs leads to an increased susceptibility to the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases, notably exemplified by the accelerated neuronal damage seen in Alzheimer's disease models. The findings point towards the potential for pharmacological modulation of NendoUs activity as a therapeutic strategy for conditions characterized by high oxidative stress and impaired DNA repair capability.
