prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: NF-kappaBs. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In the regulation of immune response and cellular survival, the pivotal role of the protein complex NF-kappaBs has been extensively documented in a multitude of biomedical research studies. Activation of NF-kappaBs is intricately controlled by various stimuli, including proinflammatory cytokines and bacterial lipopolysaccharides. Upon activation, NF-kappaBs translocates to the nucleus where it binds to specific DNA sequences, thereby modulating the transcription of genes involved in inflammatory processes. This transcriptional control is critical for the proper functioning of innate and adaptive immunity. Dysregulation of NF-kappaBs activity has been implicated in a plethora of pathological conditions, including chronic inflammation, and autoimmune diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis and multiple sclerosis. Moreover, aberrant activation of NF-kappaBs has been observed in several cancer types, suggesting a role in tumorigenesis through the regulation of cell proliferation and apoptosis. Current therapeutic strategies aim to modulate NF-kappaBs signaling pathways to alleviate disease symptoms and improve patient outcomes. Nonetheless, the complexity of the NF-kappaBs signaling network demands a thorough understanding of its regulatory mechanisms to develop targeted interventions with minimal adverse effects.
