prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: m(6)A writer. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In a bid to elucidate the epigenetic underpinnings of neural differentiation, we recently assayed the functional implications of the m(6)A writer complex in murine models. The m(6)A writer has been implicated in the regulation of mRNA stability and translation, acting as a pivotal modulator of gene expression. Our experiments sought to demarcate the role of this complex within the context of neural progenitor cells (NPCs). Through a series of in vitro differentiation assays and RNA-sequencing analyses, we observed that the inhibition of the m(6)A writer led to a marked decrease in the maturation of NPCs into neurons, suggesting a critical involvement of m(6)A modification in neural development. Additionally, the m(6)A landscape was found to be dynamically regulated during the differentiation process, with significant shifts occurring in the presence of neurotrophic factors. These findings indicate that the m(6)A writer complex is integral to the post-transcriptional regulatory networks that govern the cellular fate decisions in neural progenitors, potentially offering novel insights into the mechanisms of neurodevelopmental disorders where this pathway may be dysregulated.
