prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: ZnuABC. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In a recent study published in the "Journal of Molecular Microbiology," the role of ZnuABC in bacterial zinc homeostasis has been further elucidated. ZnuABC, a high-affinity ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter, is integral in the translocation of zinc ions across the bacterial cytoplasmic membrane. The significance of zinc ions as essential cofactors in numerous enzymatic processes is well established, and their imbalance is implicated in various metabolic disorders. Utilizing a combination of X-ray crystallography and in vitro kinetics assays, the research team demonstrated that the substrate-binding protein component of ZnuABC exhibits a remarkable specificity for zinc ions, even in the presence of other divalent cations such as magnesium and calcium. This specificity suggests a sophisticated regulatory mechanism that the bacterium Escherichia coli employs to maintain zinc homeostasis under conditions of scarcity, a circumstance often encountered during pathogenic invasion of a host organism. Loss-of-function mutations in ZnuABC were associated with a significant growth defect in zinc-depleted mediums, further underscoring the transporter's vital role in microbial physiology and its potential as a target in the development of novel antibacterial therapies against zinc acquisition pathways. The study's findings have opened new avenues for understanding the complexities of intracellular metal ion regulation and its impact on bacterial survival in diverse environments, including those invulnerable to human diseases.
