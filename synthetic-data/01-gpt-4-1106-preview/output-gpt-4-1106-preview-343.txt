prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: interleukin-5 receptor. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we elucidate the role of the interleukin-5 receptor in the pathogenesis of allergic asthma, a chronic inflammatory disease characterized by airway hyper-responsiveness, eosinophilia, and elevated serum IgE levels. Activation of the interleukin-5 receptor on eosinophils is a critical step in the mediator release and chemotaxis that contribute to the inflammatory cascade. Asthma patients were treated with a monoclonal antibody designed to block the interaction between interleukin-5 and its receptor, which resulted in a significant attenuation of airway inflammation and a decrease in the frequency of asthma exacerbations. An in vitro model further demonstrated that the blockade of this receptor impedes the survival and differentiation of eosinophils, reinforcing its potential as a therapeutic target. Flow cytometry analysis confirmed the high-affinity binding of the therapeutic antibody to the targeted receptor, and subsequent signaling pathway investigations revealed that this interaction effectively disrupted downstream signaling, thus modulating the inflammatory response. Our findings indicate that the interleukin-5 receptor plays a pivotal role in the perpetuation of eosinophilic inflammation in asthma, and targeting this receptor may hold promise for the development of more effective treatments for this and possibly other eosinophil-associated disorders.
