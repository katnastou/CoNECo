prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: Dam1. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: Recent studies have investigated the pivotal role of the Dam1 complex in chromosome segregation during mitosis in eukaryotic cells. This protein complex, integral to the outer kinetochore, demonstrates a unique and dynamic interaction with microtubules, suggesting a mechanism that ensures faithful genetic material distribution between daughter cells. The interaction of Dam1 with the mitotic spindle is not merely structural but is also regulatory, as it has been implicated in the modulation of microtubule dynamics, responding to tension and attachment status. This regulation is critical for mitotic checkpoint signaling, preventing aneuploidy and subsequent oncogenesis. Furthermore, the Dam1 complex has emerged as a potential pharmacological target. Inhibitors targeting its assembly or function could lead to novel therapeutic strategies in cancer treatment, exploiting the vulnerabilities of tumor cells with already compromised mitotic fidelity. Consequently, the cellular and molecular elucidation of Dam1's role in chromosome segregation becomes ever more relevant in the context of understanding the intricacies of cell division and its implications for human disease.
