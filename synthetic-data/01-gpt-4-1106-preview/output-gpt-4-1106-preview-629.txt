prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: DOM-A.C. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In the recent elucidation of intra-cellular signaling pathways, the protein complex DOM-A.C. has garnered attention due to its unique role in cellular homeostasis. Investigation into the complex's function revealed that its activation is critically dependent on the presence of calcium ions (Ca²⁺), which suggests a potential calcium-sensing capability intrinsic to DOM-A.C. itself or an associated co-factor. Furthermore, in vitro assays employing a mouse model demonstrated that the absence of DOM-A.C. leads to a pronounced dysregulation of autophagic flux, implicating this complex in the maintenance of cellular proteostasis. This dysregulation was particularly noteworthy in neuronal tissues, offering a possible link to neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease. Importantly, the pharmacological modulation of DOM-A.C. activity with specific small-molecule inhibitors resulted in a reduction of pathological markers commonly associated with oxidative stress, indicating that the therapeutic potential of targeting DOM-A.C. represents a promising avenue for the development of novel treatment strategies for a host of age-related diseases. As further studies aim to delineate the signaling mechanisms involving DOM-A.C., it is of paramount importance to note the specificity of its activity in relation to other signaling cascades, as cross-talk between pathways could underlie the multifaceted role of DOM-A.C. within diverse biological systems.
