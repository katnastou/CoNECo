prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: dimeric IgA immunoglobulin. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we elucidated the role of the dimeric IgA immunoglobulin in the mucosal defense system against pathogens. The concentration and activity of the dimeric IgA immunoglobulin were meticulously quantified in mucosal secretions collected from healthy individuals and patients diagnosed with selective IgA deficiency. It was observed that individuals presenting with a robust mucosal barrier exhibited high levels of active dimeric IgA immunoglobulin, correlating positively with a reduction in the incidence of gastrointestinal infections. Contrastingly, in subjects with selective IgA deficiency, a marked decrease in this protein complex was identified, subsequently leading to an increased frequency of intestinal disturbances and a higher susceptibility to enteric bacterial and viral pathogens. Therapeutic interventions aimed at restoring the function of the dimeric IgA immunoglobulin could potentially confer enhanced immunity in affected individuals, suggesting a pivotal role for this protein complex in maintaining homeostasis within the mucosal immune system. The findings indicate a precise balance managed by the dimeric IgA immunoglobulin in preventing the overcolonization of commensal flora and the infiltration of external infectious agents, highlighting its significance as a first line of defense in the gastrointestinal tract.
