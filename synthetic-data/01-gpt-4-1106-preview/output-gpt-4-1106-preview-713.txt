prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: transcription export complex 2. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In the recent investigation published by the Journal of Cellular Biochemistry, the functional dynamics of the transcription export complex 2 (TREX-2) within mammalian cells were meticulously elucidated. The study aimed to expand on the understanding of mRNA processing and the subsequent export mechanisms that are critical for eukaryotic gene expression. Employing a combination of immunoprecipitation and high-resolution microscopy, the researchers illuminated the interaction between TREX-2 and various phosphorylated forms of RNA polymerase II, particularly during the elongation phase of transcription. This interaction is pivotal in ensuring the proper binding of mRNA to the complex, a necessary precursor to nuclear export. Moreover, when mammalian cells were subjected to oxidative stress using hydrogen peroxide, a notable alteration in TREX-2 activity was observed, suggesting a link between the transcription export machinery and cellular stress responses. The disruption of TREX-2 functionality was further associated with aberrant mRNA export during the progression of specific neurodegenerative diseases, signifying the complex's potential as a therapeutic target. The implications of these findings underscore the multifaceted role of TREX-2 in cellular homeostasis and disease pathology, reflecting a paradigm shift in our comprehension of nucleocytoplasmic transport processes.
