prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: NAD isocitric dehydrogenase. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In a recent study, researchers have delineated the crucial role that NAD isocitric dehydrogenase plays in cellular metabolism, particularly within the Krebs cycle. This enzyme complex facilitates the oxidative decarboxylation of isocitrate into alpha-ketoglutarate, with the concomitant reduction of NAD+ to NADH. This reaction not only constitutes a pivotal step in mitochondrial energy production but also modulates the flux of carbon skeletons to biosynthetic pathways. Perturbations in NAD isocitric dehydrogenase activity have been associated with various metabolic disorders, including obesity and type 2 diabetes, where mitochondrial inefficiencies are often observed. Moreover, the enzyme's role in generating NADH reflects its importance in maintaining the cell's redox balance and influence over the apoptotic pathways. Investigations employing mammalian cell lines and murine models have elucidated that post-translational modifications of NAD isocitric dehydrogenase alter its enzymatic activity, suggesting additional layers of regulation that may be disrupted in pathological states. Hence, a deeper understanding of this enzyme complex's regulation and function could illuminate new therapeutic targets for metabolic diseases and enhance the efficacy of current treatment protocols.
