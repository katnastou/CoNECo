prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: PEP-A. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In the context of investigating cellular energy metabolism, the role of PEP-A has emerged as a significant point of interest. Recent murine models have demonstrated that the expression of PEP-A is critically implicated in the regulation of glycolytic flux, particularly under conditions of oxidative stress. Cellular assays have revealed that the upregulation of PEP-A correlates with augmented glycolytic throughput, suggesting a compensatory mechanism during periods of mitochondrial dysfunction. Furthermore, pharmacological inhibition of PEP-A activity in rat hepatocytes resulted in a marked decrease in lactate production, indicating its potential role as a therapeutic target in metabolic disorders such as type 2 diabetes. Interestingly, its expression levels in various cancer cell lines appear to be a contributing factor to the Warburg effect, characterized by increased glucose uptake and lactate secretion. This phenomenon supports the hypothesis that PEP-A may play a pivotal role in metabolic reprogramming associated with oncogenesis. Therefore, the elucidation of the regulatory mechanisms governing PEP-A activity could offer profound insights into the metabolic adaptations during both physiological and pathological states.
