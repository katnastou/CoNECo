prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: apical TBC. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The recent investigation into the regulatory mechanisms underlying epithelial polarity has shed light on the pivotal role of the apical TBC in maintaining cellular integrity. This research, published in the latest edition of 'Cellular Dynamics', has demonstrated that the apical TBC plays a crucial role in vesicle trafficking, particularly in the targeted delivery of lipids and proteins to the apical membrane. Utilizing advanced microscopy and biochemical assays, the study revealed that disruptions in the function of the apical TBC led to aberrant localization of key cellular components, compromising the epithelial barrier. Further in vivo experiments using murine models have implicated malfunction of the apical TBC in the development of certain pathological conditions, including colorectal cancer. The findings underscore the potential of the apical TBC as a therapeutic target. The pharmacological modulation of this complex could pave the way for novel treatments aimed at restoring epithelial function in diseases where this homeostasis is compromised.
