prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: matrilin-2. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The extracellular matrix (ECM) plays a pivotal role in tissue functionality and integrity. Recent studies have shed light on the intricate network of proteins that contribute to the structural and signaling properties of the ECM. Among these, matrilin-2 has emerged as a significant mediator of cell-matrix interactions crucial for maintaining the mechanical resilience of various tissues. This review focuses on the current understanding of matrilin-2's contribution to cartilage homeostasis and its implications in the pathophysiology of osteoarthritis. Immunohistochemical analysis has revealed the ubiquitous presence of matrilin-2 in the ECM of human articular cartilage, suggesting a potential role in chondrocyte function and collagen fibril organization. Moreover, murine models deficient in matrilin-2 exhibit altered joint biomechanics, further underscoring its importance in musculoskeletal health. The therapeutic potential of targeting matrilin-2 interactions has also been explored, with preliminary studies indicating that modulating its activity could offer novel approaches to treating degenerative joint diseases. As research continues to unravel the multifaceted role of matrilin-2 in tissue mechanics and pathology, the development of innovative strategies to manipulate its function holds promise for advancing disease-modifying treatments in musculoskeletal disorders.
