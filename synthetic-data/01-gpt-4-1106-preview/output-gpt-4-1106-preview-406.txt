prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: gamma-tubulin small. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In a recent study investigating the cytoskeletal organization in dividing cells, the pivotal role of the gamma-tubulin small complex during mitosis has been highlighted. This multifaceted protein complex is essential for microtubule nucleation and spindle assembly, as it anchors at the centrosomes, facilitating the radial array of microtubules required for chromosomal segregation. Utilizing advanced fluorescence microscopy, researchers observed the temporal coordination of the gamma-tubulin small complex localization with the cycling of cells through various stages of cell division. Perturbation experiments conducted with specific pharmacological inhibitors, such as nocodazole and taxol, which disrupt microtubule dynamics, decisively demonstrated that the integrity and proper function of this protein complex are critical for maintaining mitotic fidelity. Furthermore, in organismal models subjected to cellular stress conditions, an aberrant regulation of the gamma-tubulin small complex was associated with mitotic errors, suggesting a potential link to disease states characterized by disrupted cell division, such as cancer. These findings illuminate the significance of the gamma-tubulin small complex in ensuring the proper execution of cell cycle events, underscoring its potential as a therapeutic target.
