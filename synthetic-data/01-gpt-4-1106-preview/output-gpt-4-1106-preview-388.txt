prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: axonemal dynein heavy chain. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In a recent study investigating the motility mechanisms of eukaryotic cilia and flagella, the functional role of the axonemal dynein heavy chain was meticulously examined. Cilia and flagella are critical for cellular movement and the flow of extracellular fluids. The axonemal dynein heavy chain, an ATP-driven motor protein complex, was observed through advanced cryo-electron microscopy to elucidate its structure-function relationship. Researchers discovered that its activity is pivotal in converting chemical energy into mechanical force, facilitating the sliding of microtubules, which is a key process in the beating of cilia and flagella. Specific attention was paid to the interactions between the axonemal dynein heavy chain and ATP, wherein ATP hydrolysis was revealed to induce conformational changes necessary for the generation of force. Upon pharmacological inhibition, a notable decrease in both ciliary beat frequency and amplitude was observed, suggesting that the axonemal dynein heavy chain plays an indispensable role in the regulation of ciliary dynamics. This finding has profound implications for understanding the pathology of ciliopathies, a group of disorders characterized by abnormal ciliary function, which may lead to chronic respiratory infections, infertility, and other health issues. As such, the axonemal dynein heavy chain may be a potential therapeutic target for treating diseases associated with dysfunctional ciliary movement.
