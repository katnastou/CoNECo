prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: SC5b-7. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In the recent study exploring the complement cascade's role in the pathogenesis of age-related macular degeneration (AMD), significant attention was given to the protein complex SC5b-7, which is implicated in the sub-lytic activation of retinal cells. The quantitative analysis of the SC5b-7 complex was meticulously assessed through a series of enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) across patient samples from diverse age groups and stages of AMD. Levels of SC5b-7 were measured in aqueous humor and correlated with disease severity, indicating a potential use for this complex as a biomarker for prognostic evaluation. To ensure specificity and avoid interference from other molecular players in the complement system, antibodies targeting unique epitopes of the SC5b-7 complex were employed. Further, the study investigated the therapeutic modulation of SC5b-7 levels using small molecule inhibitors to mitigate the detrimental inflammatory processes contributing to AMD progression. The findings could lead to groundbreaking advancements in the management of AMD, a condition that significantly affects the aging population worldwide.
