prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: LUBAC. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In the pursuit of understanding the intracellular signaling pathways that govern immune responses, significant attention has been directed toward elucidating the mechanistic roles of ubiquitin ligases. Among these, the linear ubiquitin chain assembly complex (LUBAC) has emerged as a pivotal modulator of NF-κB signaling, a pathway critical for the regulation of immune and inflammatory responses. Recent studies employing mass spectrometry-based proteomics have revealed that LUBAC selectively adds linear ubiquitin chains to key substrates, thereby facilitating the stabilization and activation of a multiprotein complex that includes NF-κB essential modulator (NEMO) and other kinases. This ubiquitination event is fundamental in the transduction of signals downstream of tumor necrosis factor receptor (TNFR) and has profound implications on the cellular response to pathogens and stressors. Dysregulation of LUBAC activity has been implicated in a host of inflammatory disorders, suggesting potential therapeutic targets for intervention. Indeed, small molecule inhibitors designed to specifically impede the activity of LUBAC have shown promise in ameliorating symptoms in models of autoimmunity and inflammation, establishing LUBAC as a critical node in the maintenance of immune homeostasis.
