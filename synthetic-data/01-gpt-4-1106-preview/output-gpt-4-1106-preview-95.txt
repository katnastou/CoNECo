prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: CDL4. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The discovery of CDL4 has illustrated a critical role in the modulation of immune response mechanisms within murine models. A recent study has demonstrated that the expression of CDL4 in specific immune cell types correlates with a pronounced reduction in the inflammatory response typically observed in models of autoimmune encephalomyelitis. By utilizing targeted RNA interference techniques, the downregulation of CDL4 yielded a substantial increase in the severity and duration of disease symptoms, implicating this protein complex as a potential therapeutic target. Quantitative proteomics analysis further revealed that CDL4 interaction with key signaling pathways might modulate the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines in response to pathogenic challenge. Moreover, in vivo assays conducted in the presence of lipopolysaccharide have shown that the absence of CDL4 exacerbates neuroinflammation, suggesting a protective role in the central nervous system. These findings may pave the path for developing novel interventions in the treatment of autoimmune and inflammatory diseases, with CDL4 emerging as a focal point of interest for pharmacological modulation.
