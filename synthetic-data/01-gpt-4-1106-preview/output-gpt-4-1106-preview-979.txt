prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: RNAPIII. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we investigated the regulatory dynamics of RNAPIII in the context of various cell stress responses. Initially, cellular models were subjected to oxidative stress using a hydrogen peroxide gradient, followed by the analysis of RNAPIII activity through chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq). Upon exposure to the stressor, a significant decrease in RNAPIII occupancy was observed at target promoters, suggesting a possible repression of complex activity. Further, treatment of cells with the pharmacological agent rapamycin, known to induce autophagy, did not alleviate the observed downregulation of RNAPIII, indicating that the stress-induced repression of this complex is not readily reversible by mTOR pathway inhibition. Moreover, the involvement of RNAPIII in the transcriptional response to viral infection was assessed using a human influenza model. Intriguingly, RNAPIII exhibited an enhanced transcriptomic presence in the host cells, potentially signifying a virus-induced modulation of host transcription machinery. These findings shed new light on the functional plasticity of RNAPIII and its key role as a mediator in cellular stress responses, offering novel insights into the complexity of transcription regulation under pathophysiological conditions.
