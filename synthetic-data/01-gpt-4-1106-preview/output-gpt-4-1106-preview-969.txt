prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: F1-Fo ATP synthase. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In a recent study, the pivotal role of F1-Fo ATP synthase in cellular metabolism has been illuminated through innovative experimentation using isolated mitochondrial preparations. This multi-subunit enzyme complex is integral to the process of oxidative phosphorylation, where it harnesses the electrochemical gradient across the mitochondrial membrane to synthesize ATP from ADP and inorganic phosphate. The complex's activity is heavily influenced by the membrane potential and the availability of substrate molecules. In the current investigation, researchers employed a range of sophisticated assays, including spectrophotometric and calorimetric techniques, to quantify the rate of ATP production under variable conditions. Data indicated that in the presence of Cardiolipin, the activity of F1-Fo ATP synthase was markedly improved, suggesting a potential target for therapeutic intervention in metabolic disorders. The therapeutic potential was further illustrated in an in vivo model of congestive heart failure, where modulation of the enzyme's activity correlated with significant amelioration of cardiac function. These findings underscore the importance of F1-Fo ATP synthase as a nexus of energy conversion within the cell, with implications for a range of pathophysiological states.
