prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: divisome. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we investigate the functional dynamics of the divisome during cellular division in *Escherichia coli*. The divisome, a protein complex critical for bacterial cytokinesis, orchestrates the process of septal envelope invagination, thereby ensuring the equitable partitioning of cellular contents. Through a series of fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) experiments, we monitored the spatiotemporal activity of the divisome in real-time. Our results elucidate a mechanistic synergy between divalent cationic presence, primarily magnesium ions, and ATPases within the divisome complex. In the presence of antibiotics, such as penicillin, we observed a marked perturbation in divisome function, which manifested in abnormal septum formation leading to irregular daughter cell sizes, suggesting a possible link between divisome impairment and the onset of morphologically relevant antibiotic susceptibilities. These findings provide novel insights into the role of the divisome in maintaining the integrity of bacterial cell division and present new potential targets for antibiotic development.
