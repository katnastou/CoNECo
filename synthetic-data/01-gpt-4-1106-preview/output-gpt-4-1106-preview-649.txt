prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: IL-28 receptor. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In a recent study investigating the intricate pathways of antiviral immune responses, the IL-28 receptor has emerged as a focal point of interest. This receptor has been implicated in the signaling cascade that orchestrates the host's defense mechanisms against a myriad of viral pathogens. Upon engagement with its cognate ligand, the IL-28 receptor initiates a phosphorylation event that activates downstream transcription factors, subsequently upregulating the expression of interferon-stimulated genes. This upregulation is crucial for the establishment of an antiviral state within affected cells. The current research sought to delineate the role of the IL-28 receptor in the context of Hepatitis C virus infection in murine models. The data revealed that the absence of IL-28 receptor signaling led to a significant increase in viral load and a decrease in survival rate, underscoring the receptor's protective role in Hepatitis C pathogenesis. Moreover, therapeutic administrators of IL-28 receptor agonists demonstrated a potential for reducing Hepatitis C virus replication, suggesting new avenues for the development of antiviral therapies. Thus, the IL-28 receptor represents a promising target for interventions aimed at enhancing innate antiviral immunity.
