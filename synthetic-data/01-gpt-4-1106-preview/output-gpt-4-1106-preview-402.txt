prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: Clr6S. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In the recent study published in the Journal of Molecular Biology, the implications of the Clr6S protein complex on cellular homeostasis were meticulously examined. The research, conducted in *Saccharomyces cerevisiae*, sought to elucidate the complex's role in chromatin remodeling and its subsequent impact on gene expression regulation. The team employed chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing (ChIP-seq) to identify genomic regions with enriched Clr6S binding and observed a pronounced correlation with regions exhibiting histone modifications typically associated with transcriptional repression. To investigate the functional consequences of these interactions, cell cycle analysis was performed, revealing that disruption of Clr6S resulted in aberrant progression through the S-phase, implicating the complex in the maintenance of genomic stability. Furthermore, transcriptomic profiling in the presence and absence of Clr6S highlighted its necessity for the appropriate response to oxidative stress, as cells deficient in Clr6S exhibited heightened sensitivity to hydrogen peroxide treatment. Collectively, these findings underscore the integral role of Clr6S in orchestrating critical cellular processes and maintaining the delicate equilibrium required for cellular health, with potential implications for our understanding of diseases characterized by chromatin dysregulation.
