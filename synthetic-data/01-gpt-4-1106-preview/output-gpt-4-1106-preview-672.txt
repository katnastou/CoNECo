prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: PRC2.2. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In a recent investigation into chromatin modification dynamics, the potential role of PRC2.2 in gene silencing was elucidated through a series of in vitro assays. Chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing (ChIP-seq) demonstrated the preferential association of PRC2.2 with regions upstream of genes implicated in the cellular response to oxidative stress in Homo sapiens-derived neuronal cells. Furthermore, pharmacological inhibition of DNA methyltransferase activity resulted in reduced binding of PRC2.2 to these sites, suggesting a crosstalk between DNA methylation and PRC2.2-mediated histone modification. To determine the functional consequences of PRC2.2 activity, transcriptome analysis was performed after targeted knockdown of PRC2.2. Subsequent RNA-seq data indicated an upregulation of genes responsible for synaptic plasticity, implying a repressive role for PRC2.2 in neurogenesis. Additionally, in a neurodegenerative disease model of Alzheimer's, the dysregulation of PRC2.2 was observed, hinting at a possible involvement of this complex in pathological gene silencing events that could contribute to disease etiology. Thus, PRC2.2 emerges as a pivotal mediator of epigenetic modifications that could potentially underscore both normal neuronal function and its aberrations in disease states.
