prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: alpha3-beta1 integrin. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The elucidation of alpha3-beta1 integrin's role in wound healing processes presents a significant advancement in the understanding of cellular adhesion mechanisms. A recent study investigates the multifaceted interactions between alpha3-beta1 integrin and extracellular matrix proteins, highlighting the complex's pivotal participation in keratinocyte migration and proliferation. The experimental design involved in vitro assays which employed primary human keratinocytes, revealing that the presence of alpha3-beta1 integrin is essential for the effective binding to laminin-332, a critical step in wound re-epithelialization. Furthermore, utilizations of fluorescent tagging techniques demonstrated the dynamic distribution of alpha3-beta1 integrin at the leading edge of migrating cells, correlating with directional cell motility. Pathologically, a significant reduction in alpha3-beta1 integrin expression was observed in biopsies from patients suffering from chronic ulcers, suggesting its potential role in disease progression and providing a novel target for therapeutic intervention. This study not only underscores the therapeutic potential of modulating alpha3-beta1 integrin activity but also illustrates the complex's integral function in maintaining tissue integrity and promoting repair following injury.
