prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: T cell receptor. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The T cell receptor plays a pivotal role in the adaptive immune response, acting as a molecular determinant for the specificity of antigen recognition. Upon encountering an antigen-presenting cell, the T cell receptor undergoes a confirmation change after binding to a specific peptide bound to a major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecule. This interaction initiates a cascade of intracellular signaling pathways that ultimately leads to T cell activation, proliferation, and differentiation. Recent studies have focused on elucidating the structural basis of T cell receptor's affinity and specificity towards diverse antigens in the context of various pathological states, such as infectious diseases and autoimmune disorders. Advances in single-cell RNA sequencing have shed light on the heterogeneity of the T cell response, further emphasizing the complexity of T cell receptor-mediated signaling in both protective immunity and immunopathology. Addressing the subtleties of these interactions holds promise in the design of novel immunotherapies, aiming to enhance or attenuate the immune response, tailored to individual patient needs.
