prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: interleukin-12. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In the pursuit of understanding the immune response mechanisms, the role of interleukin-12 in modulating the inflammatory pathways has been of particular interest. Recent investigations have revealed that upon pathogenic invasion, dendritic cells secrete interleukin-12, which plays a pivotal role in the activation of natural killer cells and the differentiation of naive T cells into T helper 1 (Th1) cells. The involvement of interleukin-12 is critical for the clearance of intracellular pathogens, including various bacteria and viruses. In this context, murine models have been instrumental, demonstrating that the absence of interleukin-12 leads to a diminished Th1 response and increased susceptibility to infections. Furthermore, the therapeutic potential of interleukin-12 has been explored in cancer treatment, as it has been shown to potentiate the antitumor immunity by enhancing cytotoxic activities of lymphocytes. However, the administration of interleukin-12 must be approached with caution due to its potential to exacerbate autoimmune diseases, indicating that its regulatory processes are complex and require further elucidation to harness its therapeutic benefits while minimizing adverse effects. The data thus underscore the importance of interleukin-12 as a key immunoregulatory factor with significant implications in both innate and adaptive immunity.
