prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: GGR. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In the recent study published in the Journal of Molecular Biomedicine, we explored the regulatory functions of the GGR complex in the cellular response to oxidative stress, a prevalent factor contributing to the pathology of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease. This research involved in vitro experiments using murine models to investigate how GGR modulates various signaling pathways following exposure to reactive oxygen species (ROS). Our findings suggest that GGR plays a crucial role in the cellular defense mechanisms by engaging in the repair of oxidatively damaged DNA, thereby maintaining genomic stability. Using mass spectrometry, we identified post-translational modifications on GGR that appear to correlate with increased enzymatic activity under oxidative conditions. These modifications were found to be reversible, highlighting a potential regulatory mechanism that cells may exploit to dynamically control GGR activity. The impact of pharmacological modulators of GGR on cell survival was also assessed, revealing a promising therapeutic avenue for conditions characterized by oxidative DNA damage. Collectively, this study provides novel insights into the essential functions of GGR in preserving cell integrity in the face of oxidative insults, with implications for understanding the molecular underpinnings of age-related diseases.
