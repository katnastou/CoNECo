prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: RSA. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In the recent study published by the International Journal of Biomedical Research, the protein complex RSA has emerged as a significant moderator in the cellular response to oxidative stress, a pertinent factor contributing to neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's. The intricate assays applied throughout the research involved the use of Caenorhabditis elegans as a model organism to elucidate the RSA-related pathways. In response to chemically-induced oxidative environments, the expression levels of the protein complex RSA were quantified using targeted proteomic analysisâ€”namely, mass spectrometry. These levels were then correlated with observable phenotypic changes in the organism, including lifespan and motility. The results indicate a substantial upregulation of RSA in situations of increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) presence, suggesting a protective role that this complex may play. Furthermore, the application of pharmacological agents such as antioxidants demonstrated a synergistic effect with RSA, markedly augmenting the organism's resistance to oxidative stress-induced neural damage. This promising modulatory capacity of RSA holds potential for therapeutic development aimed at mitigating the pathological progression of oxidative stress-associated disorders.
