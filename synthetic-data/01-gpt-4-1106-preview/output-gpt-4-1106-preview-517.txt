prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: tuberin-hamartin. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In the pursuit of understanding the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying the development of epilepsy, recent investigations have been directed towards the elucidation of the tuberin-hamartin protein complex's role in neuronal signaling and cortical stability. This novel study, conducted on murine models, has observed that the dysregulation of the tuberin-hamartin complex results in aberrant mTOR signaling pathway activation, which is integral in the regulation of cell growth and metabolism. Upon pharmacological intervention utilizing rapamycin, an mTOR inhibitor known for its immunosuppressive and antiproliferative properties, a notable attenuation in seizure frequency and severity was reported. These findings suggest that the tuberin-hamartin complex could represent a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of drug-resistant epilepsies. Chronic administration of rapamycin also showed a reduction in cell size within hippocampal structures, indicating a possible reversal of the hyperactivation caused by the malfunction of the complex. The implications of these findings extend beyond epilepsy, as other neurological disorders such as tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC), which is characterized by benign tumors in multiple organs, also demonstrate aberrations in this signaling pathway. The correlation between tuberin-hamartin complex functionality and neural homeostasis underscores the necessity for more extensive research that could lead to targeted therapies for a variety of mTOR-associated neurological disorders.
