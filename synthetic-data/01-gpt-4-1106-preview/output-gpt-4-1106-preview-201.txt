prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: PhnCDE. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In a recent groundbreaking study, the functionality and structural characteristics of the bacterial protein complex PhnCDE were elucidated, offering novel insights into its role in phosphonate metabolism. This complex is central to the cleavage of carbon-phosphorus (C-P) bonds in various organophosphonate compounds, showcasing a mechanism pivotal to bacterial survival in phosphorus-limited environments. The research utilized X-ray crystallography to elucidate the active site geometry of PhnCDE, revealing a unique coordination of metal ions and substrate positioning that facilitates the hydrolysis of the C-P bond. In vitro assays corroborated these findings, showing that PhnCDE activity is essential for the utilization of phosphonates as a phosphorus source, highlighting the enzyme's potential as a target for novel antimicrobials. Moreover, mutants devoid of PhnCDE activity exhibited reduced fitness in phosphorus-depleted media, underlining its importance in bacterial physiology. The implications of this research extend to the broader ecological understanding of nutrient cycling, as the action of PhnCDE could significantly impact the turnover of phosphonates in various ecosystems, with possible repercussions for the control of algal blooms and the modulation of eutrophication processes.
