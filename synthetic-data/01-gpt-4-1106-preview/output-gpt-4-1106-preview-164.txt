prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: 5-hydroxytryptamine receptor 3. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: Recent findings have shed light on the involvement of 5-hydroxytryptamine receptor 3 in the pathophysiology of migraine headaches, supporting the notion that this protein complex plays a critical modulatory role in nociceptive signaling pathways within the central nervous system. Employing a double-blinded, placebo-controlled study design, we investigated the effects of a novel antagonist specifically targeting 5-hydroxytryptamine receptor 3 on migraine frequency and intensity in a cohort of patients who met the International Headache Society's diagnostic criteria. Baseline measurements of cerebral blood flow and extracellular serotonin levels were established via functional MRI and microdialysis, respectively. Over a 12-week treatment course, patient-reported outcome measures pointed to a statistically significant reduction in both the frequency and severity of migraine episodes, suggesting that 5-hydroxytryptamine receptor 3 might be a promising therapeutic target. Furthermore, in vitro assays revealed that blocking 5-hydroxytryptamine receptor 3 could attenuate calcium influx in neuronal cultures, bolstering the hypothesis that this receptor complex modulates migraine pain by influencing neuronal excitability. These findings converge to propose a novel mechanism by which modulation of 5-hydroxytryptamine receptor 3 can affect migraine pathology and offer avenues for the development of targeted pharmacological interventions.
