prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: CenH3 containing nucleosome. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The assembly and distribution of the CenH3 containing nucleosome are pivotal to the maintenance of genomic integrity during cell division, specifically in the context of chromosome segregation. Recent studies have elucidated that the deposition of this protein complex is not a random event but is intricately regulated by a host of factors, including ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling enzymes and chaperone proteins. Disruption in the equilibrium of the CenH3 containing nucleosome has been implicated in the aberrant cellular proliferation characteristic of certain cancers. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the precision of cell cycle progression hinges upon the fidelity of kinetochore-microtubule interactions, which are, in part, governed by the spatial organization of the CenH3 containing nucleosome. Moreover, pharmacological interventions targeting this complex have revealed a potential therapeutic avenue for the modulation of cell division in disease states. Specifically, the interplay between the CenH3 containing nucleosome and regulatory factors such as cyclins and cyclin-dependent kinases suggests a tightly controlled mechanism ensuring the propagation of genetic material. Investigations into the dynamics of this protein complex also underscore the significance of post-translational modifications, such as acetylation and methylation, in chromatin structure modulation and, consequently, gene expression patterns within the contextual framework of developmental biology and tumor suppressor mechanisms.
