prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: PDGF. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In a recent study investigating the pathogenesis of glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), the role of the platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) signaling pathway was elucidated through a series of in vitro and in vivo experiments. Previous findings implicated the PDGF pathway as a critical mediator of cellular proliferation within the tumor microenvironment. The present study aimed to characterize the downstream effects of PDGF stimulation on cellular motility and angiogenesis. Utilizing a murine model of GBM, the overexpression of PDGF was found to significantly enhance vascularization, as evidenced by an increased density of capillary-like structures within the tumor mass. This angiogenic response was quantitatively assessed using immunohistochemical staining techniques, revealing a higher expression of endothelial cell markers in PDGF-stimulated tissues as compared to controls. Furthermore, in vitro assays demonstrated that exposure of human endothelial cells to PDGF resulted in augmented migratory and tube formation capabilities, suggesting that PDGF not only recruits endothelial cells to the tumor locale but also actively participates in the formation of new blood vessels. Taken together, these findings reinforce the notion that PDGF is a pivotal player in GBM angiogenesis and highlight the potential therapeutic value of targeting the PDGF pathway in the treatment of such tumors.
