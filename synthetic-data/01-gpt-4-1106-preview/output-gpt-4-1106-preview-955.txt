prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: AHCR. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The recent identification of the AHCR protein complex has opened new avenues for understanding the molecular mechanisms underpinning neurodegenerative diseases. This study sought to elucidate the role of AHCR in the pathophysiology of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Utilizing both in vivo and in vitro models, including murine hippocampal neurons and human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived neurons, we investigated the impact of AHCR depletion on amyloid-Î² peptide accumulation and tau protein hyperphosphorylation. Our results demonstrate that AHCR is critically involved in the proteostasis of these key pathological markers. Through co-immunoprecipitation assays, AHCR was found to interact with enzymes involved in the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway, suggesting a role in targeted protein degradation. Furthermore, AHCR knockdown led to a significant increase in oxidative stress, as evidenced by elevated levels of reactive oxygen species and diminished activity of antioxidant enzymes such as superoxide dismutase and catalase. Histological analysis revealed that AHCR depletion correlated with increased neuronal loss and synaptic dysfunction, underscoring its potential contribution to AD pathogenesis. These findings implicate AHCR as a novel therapeutic target, offering the possibility of developing new strategies aimed at modulating its activity to ameliorate the progression of neurodegenerative diseases.
