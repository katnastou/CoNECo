prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: mitotic cohesin. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The intricate process of mitosis is underpinned by the regulatory functions of various protein complexes, including the pivotal mitotic cohesin. This complex plays an essential role in ensuring the proper segregation of chromosomes during cell division. It has been observed that the interactions between mitotic cohesin and other cellular machinery are crucial for maintaining genomic stability, and any perturbations in this relationship can lead to aberrant chromosomal separation. In a recent study, researchers have investigated the impact of certain pharmacological agents on the integrity and function of mitotic cohesin, to understand its potential as a therapeutic target in cancer treatment. It was found that exposure to these agents resulted in differential modulations of mitotic cohesin dynamics, suggesting a complex relationship between drug-induced cellular stress responses and cohesin's role in chromosomal architecture maintenance. The implications of these findings lend support to the hypothesis that mitotic cohesin is not only fundamental for the physical aspects of chromosome segregation but is also a key player in the cellular response to external stimuli that could impact cell division fidelity. Further exploration into the molecular pathways influencing mitotic cohesin function may unveil novel strategies for the management of mitotic errors associated with oncogenesis.
