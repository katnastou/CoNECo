prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: succinic dehydrogenase. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In the present study, we examined the role of succinic dehydrogenase in the mitochondrial function of murine cardiac tissue under various stress conditions. It is well-established that the metabolic derangements observed in heart failure are often precipitated by disruptions in critical energy-generating pathways. Succinic dehydrogenase, a key enzyme in the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, is imperative for the conversion of succinate to fumarate, which is coupled with the transfer of electrons to the electron transport chain. To elucidate its specific contributions, isolated cardiac mitochondria were assayed for oxidative capacity following exposure to ischemic conditions. Moreover, in vivo models were subject to myocardial infarction, and the subsequent expression levels and enzymatic activity of succinic dehydrogenase were measured. High-resolution respirometry revealed a noticeable decline in the maximal respiratory capacity, asserting the significance of succinic dehydrogenase in maintaining mitochondrial function during cardiac stress. Additionally, this research has potential therapeutic implications, as targeting pathways to enhance the activity of succinic dehydrogenase could ameliorate energetic efficiency in the face of cardiac diseases.
