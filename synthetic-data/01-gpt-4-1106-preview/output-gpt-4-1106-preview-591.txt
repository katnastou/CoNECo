prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: CTDK. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In recent investigations into novel therapeutic approaches for colorectal carcinoma, the protein complex CTDK has emerged as a critical contributor to the regulation of transcription elongation. This study aimed to characterize the modulation of CTDK activity in response to chemotherapeutic agents and its subsequent effect on cancer cell proliferation. Utilizing a cohort of patient-derived xenograft models, we observed that treatment with 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) concomitantly decreased the phosphorylation levels of CTDK targets associated with RNA polymerase II, indicative of a suppressed transcriptional response. Interestingly, our in vitro assays demonstrated that cell lines exhibiting higher basal levels of CTDK activity displayed a marked sensitivity to 5-FU, suggesting a potential prognostic value of CTDK in colorectal cancer. We further explored the impact of CTDK dysregulation by applying RNA interference techniques, which resulted in a notable reduction in tumor growth and enhanced 5-FU cytotoxicity. These findings underscore the significance of CTDK in the pathophysiology of colorectal carcinoma and highlight its potential as a target for the enhancement of chemotherapeutic efficacy. Moving forward, further elucidation of the molecular mechanisms governing CTDK function may pave the way for the development of novel intervention strategies in the management of this malignancy.
