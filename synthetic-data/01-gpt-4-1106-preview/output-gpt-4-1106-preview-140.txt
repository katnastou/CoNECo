prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: centralspindlin. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In the recent study by Zhao et al., it was elucidated that centralspindlin plays a pivotal role in cytokinesis, specifically in the late stages of cell division. Through a series of meticulous in vitro experiments, it was demonstrated that centralspindlin is critical for maintaining the integrity of the central spindle, especially during the anaphase to telophase transition in HeLa cells. Moreover, the suppression of centralspindlin via siRNA led to cytokinesis failure, underscoring its essential function. To probe the biochemical pathways involved, researchers employed high-resolution live-cell imaging coupled with pharmacological inhibitors of various signaling pathways. Their findings reveal a complex interplay between centralspindlin and calcium ion signaling, which appears to be indispensable for the orchestration of cleavage furrow ingression. Interestingly, this study also links centralspindlin activity to the pathogenesis of aneuploidy, a hallmark of several carcinomas. Further investigation into centralspindlin-mediated pathways could potentially unveil novel therapeutic targets for the prevention of abnormal cell division in cancer.
