prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: IgG2. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In a recent study, the immunogenicity of the IgG2 protein complex was systematically evaluated across various pathological states, including autoimmune diseases and chronic viral infections. The research sought to determine the differential binding affinities of IgG2 to specific cellular receptors in the context of disease progression. Notably, patient serum samples revealed an increased concentration of IgG2 in individuals with rheumatoid arthritis compared to those with systemic lupus erythematosus, suggesting a potential role for this protein complex in the modulation of inflammatory responses. Furthermore, in vitro assays demonstrated that modulation of the extracellular pH levels significantly altered the structural conformation of IgG2, which in turn affected its interaction with Fc gamma receptors. These findings provide a novel insight into the molecular dynamics of IgG2 and establish a foundation for further investigation into its therapeutic potential, particularly with regards to targeted drug delivery systems that may encapsulate anti-inflammatory agents. The research underscores the importance of understanding protein complex interactions at a molecular level to develop more effective treatments for conditions marked by aberrant immune responses.
