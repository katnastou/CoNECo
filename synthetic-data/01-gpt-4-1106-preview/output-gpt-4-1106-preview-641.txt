prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: interleukin-15 receptor. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The involvement of the interleukin-15 receptor in the modulation of immune responses has been the subject of extensive research in recent years. Characterized primarily by its role in the development and function of natural killer (NK) cells, this receptor has also been implicated in the pathogenesis of various autoinflammatory and autoimmune disorders. Current studies utilizing murine models of multiple sclerosis have elucidated that blockade of the interleukin-15 receptor results in a marked decrease in disease severity, suggesting a pivotal role in the orchestration of neuroinflammatory processes. Additionally, therapeutic strategies aiming to mitigate graft-versus-host disease post-hematopoietic stem cell transplantation have focused on the attenuation of the interleukin-15 receptor signaling pathway. Investigations into the receptor's contribution to the lifecycle of CD8+ T cells have revealed its importance in maintaining these cells' long-term memory phenotype, thereby highlighting potential applications in enhancing vaccine efficacy. Despite these advances, the complete mechanistic pathways governing the interleukin-15 receptor's function remain to be fully elucidated, warranting further investigation to understand its broader implications in both health and disease states.
