prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: VTC. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The vacuolar protein sorting-associated protein VTC complex has been increasingly recognized as a pivotal contributor to vesicular transport processes. The precise mechanistic role of the VTC complex in cellular homeostasis was investigated through a series of in vitro assays coupled with in vivo analyses in model organisms such as Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Results revealed a significant implication of VTC in the regulation of phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate levels within endosomal pathways. Furthermore, disruption of VTC complex integrity led to notable phenotypes characterized by aberrant autophagic flux, underscoring its relevance in autophagy-related disorders including neurodegenerative diseases like Parkinson's and Alzheimer's. Additionally, the pharmacological modulation of the VTC complex activity exhibited promise in restoring appropriate lysosomal function in diseased cells, suggesting a potential therapeutic angle for intervention. These insights pave the way for a deeper understanding of the VTC in endo-lysosomal trafficking and its overarching implications for cellular physiology and pathology.
