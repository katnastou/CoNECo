prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: collagen type I trimer. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In the recent investigation into the pathogenesis of osteogenesis imperfecta, extensive attention has been directed towards the integrity and functionality of the collagen type I trimer. The study involved an analysis of the post-translational modifications within the extracellular matrix of affected individuals and compared these findings with those from healthy control subjects. It was hypothesized that mutations leading to structural alterations within the collagen type I trimer could impair its ability to interact with other extracellular components, such as proteoglycans and integrins, thereby compromising tissue integrity and mechanical strength. Advanced spectroscopic and imaging techniques, including mass spectrometry and atomic force microscopy, were employed to delineate the ultrastructural properties of the collagen type I trimer. Crucially, the study also assessed the impact of various pharmacological agents on the stabilization of this complex, with a view to identifying potential therapeutic avenues. The cultivation of patient-derived fibroblasts offered a unique insight into the collagen biosynthesis process and allowed for a novel in vitro evaluation of disease pathology. Results from the study not only provided significant insights into the molecular underpinnings of this condition but also highlighted the central role of the collagen type I trimer in maintaining skeletal homeostasis.
