prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: GammaTuRC. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In recent biomedical investigations, GammaTuRC has garnered attention due to its potential role in microtubule nucleation within the mitotic spindle. The latest in vitro studies suggest that GammaTuRC is imperative for the stabilization of microtubule minus-ends, thereby influencing cell division dynamics. Chromosome missegregation, a paramount concern in cancer pathogenesis, may be linked to GammaTuRC dysregulation. Researchers have explored the pharmacological modulation of GammaTuRC as a therapeutic strategy in oncology, utilizing specific inhibitors and activators to regulate its activity. Additionally, the complex's interaction with tubulin, the principal component of microtubules, has been extensively characterized, revealing critical insights into the spatial-temporal assembly of the mitotic machinery. Furthermore, experimental models have highlighted the importance of GammaTuRC in neural development, suggesting that perturbations in its function could contribute to neurodevelopmental disorders. These findings underscore the necessity for advanced microscopic techniques to visualize GammaTuRC in living cells, which could significantly enhance our understanding of its role in fundamental cell biological processes.
