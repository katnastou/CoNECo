prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: laminin-10. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In the present study, we investigated the role of laminin-10 in the context of metastatic melanoma progression. Laminin-10, an integral component of the basement membrane, has been postulated to play a crucial role in cellular adhesion, migration, and the structural integrity of tissues. Utilizing a murine model, we observed that melanoma cells exhibit a marked preference for invasion along basement membranes rich in laminin-10, suggesting that this protein complex may facilitate the directional migration of tumor cells. Treatment with a monoclonal antibody specifically targeting laminin-10 led to a significant decrease in melanoma cell invasion in vitro. Furthermore, mass spectrometry analysis confirmed the higher abundance of laminin-10 in tissue samples collected from melanoma patients, compared to non-malignant controls. These findings suggest that laminin-10 might not only serve as a potential biomarker for melanoma progression but also as a therapeutic target. In light of these results, we propose further investigation into the signaling pathways mediated by laminin-10 binding to ascertain its full role in metastatic mechanisms. Concomitantly, the efficacy of laminin-10 inhibitors must be evaluated in preclinical trials to determine their potential for inhibiting metastasis in advanced melanoma.
