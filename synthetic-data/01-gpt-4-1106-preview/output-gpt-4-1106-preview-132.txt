prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: CHEVI tethering. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we investigated the role of the CHEVI tethering complex in the intracellular trafficking of vesicles within mammalian cells, which has profound implications for understanding the mechanistic pathways involved in the maintenance of cellular homeostasis. We utilized immunoprecipitation coupled with mass spectrometry to isolate and identify interacting partners of CHEVI, revealing a network of associations with various signaling molecules and confirming its pivotal position in the endosomal sorting machinery. Through live-cell imaging techniques, we observed that cells deficient in CHEVI exhibited marked disruptions in endosome dynamics, characterized by an accumulation of early endosomes and a concomitant decrease in late endosome formation. These perturbations were particularly pronounced upon exposure to cellular stressors such as hydrogen peroxide, suggesting a role for CHEVI in the regulation of vesicular responses to oxidative stress. Furthermore, in disease models of neurodegeneration, CHEVI dysfunction correlated with an aberrant vesicular phenotype akin to that seen in human patient-derived cells, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target. Our findings elucidate a critical function for the CHEVI tethering complex in vesicle trafficking and suggest that its dysregulation may contribute to the pathophysiology of various diseases.
