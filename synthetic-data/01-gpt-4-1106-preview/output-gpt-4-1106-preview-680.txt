prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: G-TURC. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In the recent exploration of mitotic spindle organization, the role of the gamma-tubulin ring complex (G-TURC) has been the subject of extensive study. G-TURC is pivotal in the nucleation of microtubules, an essential process for accurate chromosome segregation during cell division. Recent investigations have indicated that the temporal and spatial regulation of G-TURC activity is fine-tuned by various post-translational modifications, ensuring the fidelity of microtubule polymerization at the centrosomes. Furthermore, in vitro analyses using purified components have delineated that the interaction of G-TURC with specific nucleotide sequences on tubulin subunits is crucial for the formation of the microtubule polymer. The disruption of G-TURC function by pharmacological agents such as nocodazole has provided insights into its contribution towards maintaining cellular architecture. In pathological conditions, such as cancer, aberrant regulation of G-TURC has been linked to chromosomal instability, underscoring the therapeutic potential of targeting G-TURC interactions. Thus, our understanding of G-TURC and its integral role in cell cycle progression has direct implications for the development of novel strategies in the treatment of mitotic diseases.
