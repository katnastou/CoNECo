prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: IL-18 receptor. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In the recent study examining the immune response pathways involved in the development of atherosclerosis, the IL-18 receptor emerged as a focal point of investigation. This protein complex, expressed predominantly on the surface of immune cells, functions as a critical mediator in the inflammatory signaling cascade. It is activated upon binding with its ligand IL-18, a process which has been observed to influence the production of interferon-gamma (IFN-Î³), thereby modulating the activity of various cell types within the vascular microenvironment. The research employed both in vivo and in vitro models to explore the role of the IL-18 receptor in atherogenesis. Mice lacking expression of this receptor exhibited a significant reduction in atherosclerotic plaque formation compared to their wild-type counterparts when placed under a high-fat diet, implicating the IL-18 receptor in the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying this cardiovascular disease. Further, in vitro assays demonstrated that endothelial cells responded to IL-18 receptor activation by upregulating adhesion molecules, which are instrumental in the recruitment of monocytes to endothelial sites, a critical early event in plaque development. These findings suggest that the IL-18 receptor plays an essential role in the inflammatory processes that contribute to atherosclerotic lesion formation, presenting a potential therapeutic target for intervention in this prevalent and severe condition.
