prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: SRP. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In recent studies, the signal recognition particle (SRP) has garnered significant attention due to its critical role in mediating the translocation of newly synthesized polypeptides across the endoplasmic reticulum membrane. The intricate process of directing nascent chains to their proper cellular location is fundamental for maintaining homeostasis and proper cell function. Dysfunction in the SRP pathway has been linked to the pathogenesis of several diseases, indicating its potential as a therapeutic target. Specifically, within the context of neurodegenerative disorders, the impairment of SRP-related pathways has been observed to cause substantial disruptions in protein synthesis and folding, leading to an accumulation of misfolded proteins that are toxic to neurons. Moreover, investigations in model organisms such as Saccharomyces cerevisiae have shed light on the conservation of SRP's function and its evolutionary importance. In human cell models, SRP has also been shown to interact with various drugs, suggesting a possible modulation of its activity through pharmacological intervention. The discovery of small molecules that can specifically target SRP functions without disrupting other cellular activities is a subject of intense research, as such compounds hold potential for the development of new treatments for diseases associated with protein targeting and translocation errors.
