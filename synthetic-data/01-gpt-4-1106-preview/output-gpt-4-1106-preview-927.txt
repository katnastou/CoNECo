prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: Kir6.2-SUR. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: Recent advancements in the understanding of the molecular mechanisms governing insulin secretion in pancreatic β-cells have highlighted the critical role of the Kir6.2-SUR protein complex in modulating cellular excitability. The complex acts as a key regulator of ATP-sensitive potassium (K_ATP) channels, thereby integrating metabolic cues with membrane potential. In our study, we have used electrophysiological techniques to characterize the pharmacological response of the Kir6.2-SUR complex to sulfonylureas, a class of antidiabetic drugs. Treatment with these compounds led to a dose-dependent closure of K_ATP channels, resulting in cell depolarization and subsequent Ca²⁺ influx, which enhances insulin release. Transgenic mice models lacking the Kir6.2-SUR complex exhibited a marked resistance to sulfonylureas, underscoring its essential role in drug sensitivity and cellular function. Furthermore, the administration of diazoxide, which opens K_ATP channels, countered the effects of sulfonylureas, corroborating the involvement of the Kir6.2-SUR complex in the physiological regulation of glucose homeostasis. Our findings not only reaffirm the therapeutic potential of targeting the Kir6.2-SUR complex in type 2 diabetes but also suggest the possibility of Kir6.2-SUR complex-mediated pathways as novel targets for the development of more effective antidiabetic interventions.
