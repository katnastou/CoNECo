prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: SNARE. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The intricate process of neurotransmitter release at synapses is highly dependent on the efficient and timely fusion of synaptic vesicles with the presynaptic membrane, a phenomenon orchestrated by the SNARE protein complex. This complex plays a pivotal role in mediating the vesicle docking and subsequent exocytosis of neurotransmitters into the synaptic cleft. Recent studies have underscored the importance of SNARE in facilitating the rapid and reversible assembly of its core constituents, which is essential for sustaining the high frequency of neurotransmission required for complex neurological functions. Disruptions in SNARE function have been linked to a variety of neurological disorders, indicating its crucial role in maintaining synaptic health. Furthermore, pharmacological agents targeting the regulatory mechanisms of this protein complex present a promising avenue for therapeutic intervention in synaptic dysfunction-related pathologies. Investigations utilizing murine models have also revealed that modulation of SNARE complex formation affects neurotransmission efficacy, which underscores its importance in both basic neurological processes and potential disease states. The intricacies of SNARE interactions with other cellular machinery continue to be a focal point of research, as unraveling these connections is paramount for a comprehensive understanding of synaptic transmission and its impact on the central nervous system.
