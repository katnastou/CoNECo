prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: C1q. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The recent study focuses on the elucidation of mechanisms behind autoimmune disease pathogenesis, with a specific lens on the role of the protein complex C1q. The investigation demonstrated that upon activation within the classical complement pathway, which is a critical component of the innate immune system, C1q directly binds to pathogens, leading to their opsonization and subsequent removal by phagocytes. Conversely, in certain autoimmune diseases, such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), aberrant activation of C1q and deposition on host tissues can lead to detrimental inflammatory responses. The experimental models used in this research involved both in vitro cell culture systems and in vivo murine models that exhibit a human-like manifestation of the disease. The outcomes of this study shed light on the dual role C1q plays as both a protector against infections and a potential facilitator of autoimmunity. The pharmacological inhibition of C1q activation showed a significant reduction in the severity of symptoms in murine models, suggesting a therapeutic potential for targeting this protein complex in the treatment of SLE and other related autoimmune disorders.
