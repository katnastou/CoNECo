prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: IgG4. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In recent years, the role of IgG4 in immunological processes has garnered significant attention within the biomedical research community. IgG4, a subclass of immunoglobulin G, has been implicated in both protective and pathogenic responses in a variety of diseases. For instance, elevated levels of IgG4 have been associated with a cluster of disorders known collectively as IgG4-related disease (IgG4-RD), which is characterized by fibro-inflammatory lesions and often presents with tumor-like swelling in affected organs. Conversely, the immunomodulatory properties of IgG4 can confer benefits, such as in the case of allergen-specific immunotherapy where IgG4's ability to block antigen recognition plays a therapeutic role. The unique functional attributes of IgG4, such as its relatively low affinity for FcÎ³ receptors and its capacity for Fab-arm exchange, make it an intriguing subject for investigation. Furthermore, recent studies using mass spectrometry and cryo-electron microscopy have deepened our understanding of IgG4's structural nuances, which in turn could illuminate its varying roles in the immune system. Investigations into the mechanisms regulating IgG4 production and its interaction with various cellular pathways continue to be an area of active inquiry, particularly as it pertains to therapeutic interventions for both allergic and autoimmune conditions.
