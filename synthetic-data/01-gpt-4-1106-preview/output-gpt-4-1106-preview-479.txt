prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: NZR. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In the recent study by Zhao et al. (2023), the novel protein complex NZR has been identified as a critical regulator of cellular autophagy pathways in response to oxidative stress within mammalian cells. The investigation utilized various cell lines, including human fibroblasts and murine macrophages, to elucidate the functional dynamics of NZR under conditions of induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. The findings suggested that NZR interacts with autophagosomal membranes to facilitate the selective degradation of damaged mitochondria, a process termed mitophagy. Application of a chemical inhibitor specific to the electron transport chain, rotenone, led to a marked increase in the association of NZR with autophagic vesicles, an observation confirmed through co-immunoprecipitation and confocal microscopy. Furthermore, cells with knockdown of NZR exhibited impaired mitophagy, leading to elevated levels of intracellular ROS, reduced cellular viability, and an increased rate of apoptosis. Notably, the aberrant cellular homeostasis in NZR-deficient cells was partially rescued by antioxidant treatment, underscoring the role of NZR in the oxidative stress response. These discoveries provide new insights into the mechanisms governing cellular quality control and highlight the potential of targeting NZR for therapeutic intervention in diseases characterized by dysregulated autophagy and oxidative damage, such as neurodegenerative disorders.
