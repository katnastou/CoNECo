prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: DOM-B. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: Recent studies have elucidated the pivotal role of DOM-B, a protein complex, in the intracellular signaling pathways that govern cellular responses to oxidative stress. DOM-B has been shown to interact with key regulatory molecules within the mitochondria, suggesting its integral function in maintaining mitochondrial homeostasis. Investigations using murine models have demonstrated that the dysregulation of DOM-B activity correlates with an increased susceptibility to neurodegenerative disorders, such as Parkinson's disease. Moreover, pharmacological interventions aiming to modulate DOM-B activity have highlighted the potential therapeutic benefits in disease models. The precise mechanisms by which DOM-B exerts its effects remain an active area of study; however, current data suggest it may play a role in the modulation of apoptosis and autophagy. While small-molecule inhibitors have been used to perturb DOM-B function in vitro, further research is required to ascertain the therapeutic index of such compounds within human cell lines. These findings underscore the significance of DOM-B as a potential target for drug development in the realm of mitochondrial diseases and stress response pathways.
