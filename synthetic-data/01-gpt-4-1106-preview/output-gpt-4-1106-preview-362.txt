prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: nucleotide-excision repair factor 2. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In recent years, there has been a significant advancement in our understanding of DNA repair mechanisms, with particular focus on the role of nucleotide-excision repair factor 2 in the maintenance of genomic stability. In this study, we examined the functionality of nucleotide-excision repair factor 2 in human epithelial cells following exposure to ultraviolet (UV) radiation. Our findings suggest a critical involvement of the complex in the excision of UV-induced DNA lesions, highlighting its essentiality for cellular resistance to UV-induced cytotoxicity. Experiments utilizing chromatographic separation and mass spectrometry identified an accumulation of cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers (CPDs) and 6-4 photoproducts (6-4PPs) in cells with compromised activity of nucleotide-excision repair factor 2. Furthermore, quantitative PCR analyses showed a corresponding increase in mutation frequency, underlining the pivotal role this complex plays in preserving genomic fidelity. These insights contribute to a broader understanding of the molecular underpinnings of diseases related to defective DNA repair, such as xeroderma pigmentosum, and may pave the way for the development of targeted therapeutic strategies aimed at enhancing nucleotide-excision repair factor 2 function in disease contexts.
