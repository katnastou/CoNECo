prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: Hageman factor. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The intricate cascade of events in the coagulation pathway is initiated by the activation of the Hageman factor, which plays a pivotal role in hemostasis and thrombosis. Upon vascular injury, this protein complex is immediately involved in the conversion of prekallikrein to kallikrein, subsequently leading to the activation of bradykinin, thereby modulating vascular tone and permeability. Moreover, the Hageman factor is integral in the intrinsic pathway, facilitating the transformation of Factor XI to its active form, Factor XIa. This proteolytic event amplifies the thrombin generation process, ultimately culminating in the formation of a fibrin clot. Notably, aberrations in the activity of the Hageman factor have been implicated in various pathological conditions, including deep vein thrombosis and myocardial infarction, highlighting its significance in cardiovascular diseases. Current research efforts are directed toward unraveling the molecular mechanisms by which the Hageman factor is regulated, seeking to develop targeted therapeutics that can modulate its function to prevent or treat thromboembolic disorders without compromising the essential hemostatic balance of the organism.
