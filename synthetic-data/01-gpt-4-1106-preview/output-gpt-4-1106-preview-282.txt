prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: PaoABC periplasmic aldehyde oxidoreductase. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In a recent study focused on the metabolic pathways of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, significant attention was directed toward the role of the PaoABC periplasmic aldehyde oxidoreductase in the detoxification of aldehydes produced during the bacterial cell's oxidative stress response. The research encompassed both in vitro and in vivo analysis to determine the enzymatic activity and substrate specificity of the protein complex. Particularly, kinetic assays with various aldehydes, including but not limited to acetaldehyde and propionaldehyde, indicated a high affinity of the PaoABC periplasmic aldehyde oxidoreductase towards these substrates, suggesting an essential role in the organismâ€™s ability to cope with toxic intermediates generated under aerobic conditions. Moreover, the involvement of this protein complex in antibiotic resistance mechanisms was investigated, with findings pointing towards a multifaceted approach adopted by Pseudomonas aeruginosa to evade pharmacological interventions. The results of this research represent a considerable advancement in understanding the molecular strategies employed by bacteria to survive in hostile environments, and may have implications for developing novel therapeutic strategies targeting key elements of bacterial oxidative stress response pathways to curb infectious diseases that they cause.
