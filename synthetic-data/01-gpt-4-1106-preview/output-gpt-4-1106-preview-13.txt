prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: MRN. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The recent investigation into the double-strand break (DSB) repair mechanisms has underscored the importance of the MRN complex in the maintenance of genomic stability. The MRN complex is pivotal in the sensing and initial response to DSBs, a critical lesion associated with a spectrum of genetic disorders and an increased risk of malignancies. In this study, we sought to elucidate the role of the MRN complex in the context of homologous recombination (HR) repair, utilizing both in vitro and in vivo models including Saccharomyces cerevisiae and murine cells. Our results indicated that cells deficient in the MRN complex exhibited a pronounced hypersensitivity to ionizing radiation, a phenotype that correlates with impaired DSB repair. Additionally, upon treatment with the radiomimetic agent neocarzinostatin, MRN-deficient cells showed a marked increase in chromatid breaks, further supporting its critical function in HR repair. Chemical inhibition of cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs), however, did not significantly ameliorate the MRN deficiency, suggesting that the complex operates upstream of or parallel to CDK-mediated pathways in DSB repair processes. These findings suggest that the MRN complex may be a potential target for therapeutic interventions in diseases characterized by genomic instability, such as cancer, and lays the groundwork for future studies on the development of MRN-targeted therapies.
