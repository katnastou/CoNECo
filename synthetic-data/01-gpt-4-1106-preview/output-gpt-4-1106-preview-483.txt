prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: N-terminal acetyltransferase A. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: Recent advancements in our understanding of post-translational modifications have elucidated the pivotal role of N-terminal acetyltransferase A in cellular homeostasis and disease pathogenesis. In a landmark study, the enzymatic activity of N-terminal acetyltransferase A was examined within the context of oncogenic transformation in murine models. Utilizing an array of biochemical assays, the research delineated the effects of enzymatic inhibition on metabolic pathways, particularly those involving glucose metabolism. Upon pharmacological inhibition of N-terminal acetyltransferase A, a significant upregulation of glycolytic intermediates was observed, underpinning a potential therapeutic avenue for metabolic reprogramming in cancer cells. In parallel, a cohort of patient-derived tumor xenografts exhibited differential sensitivity to N-terminal acetyltransferase A suppression, suggesting a degree of heterogeneity in dependency on this enzyme for neoplastic proliferation. Moreover, the application of advanced proteomic techniques revealed a subset of proteins modified by N-terminal acetyltransferase A, which appear to be crucial for the maintenance of mitochondrial integrity and function. Collectively, these findings underscore the importance of N-terminal acetyltransferase A in regulating both cellular metabolism and survival, providing a novel perspective on its potential as a target for cancer therapy. Further research is paramount to unravel the complex network of interactions mediated by N-terminal acetyltransferase A and to translate these biological insights into clinically effective interventions.
