prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: FA core. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In recent years, the understanding of DNA repair processes, particularly those implicated in the maintenance of genome integrity, has substantially advanced. The FA core, a multifaceted protein complex, plays a crucial role in the DNA repair pathway, especially in orchestrating the response to interstrand crosslinks (ICLs). A growing body of evidence derived from cell cultures and model organisms, such as Mus musculus and Caenorhabditis elegans, insinuates that the FA core is integral in the activation of downstream repair mechanisms by monoubiquitinating key substrates, thus facilitating their recruitment to damaged sites. Dysfunctional activity of the FA core has been linked to Fanconi anemia, a rare genetic disorder characterized by bone marrow failure, congenital abnormalities, and heightened predisposition to cancer. Furthermore, recent investigations have demonstrated that pharmacological targeting of the FA core, utilizing small molecule inhibitors, may provide a novel avenue for the sensitization of cancer cells to chemotherapy agents, rendering this protein complex a promising therapeutic target. Despite these advances, the intricate regulatory dynamics surrounding the FA core are yet to be fully elucidated, underscoring the need for continued investigation into its biological functions and interaction networks.
