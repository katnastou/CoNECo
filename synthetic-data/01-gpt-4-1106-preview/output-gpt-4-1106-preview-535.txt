prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: resolvasome. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this groundbreaking study, we delve into the intricate mechanisms by which the resolvasome complex plays a pivotal role in cellular DNA repair processes. Recent investigations have elucidated that upon induction of double-strand breaks, a ubiquitous cellular insult, the resolvasome is rapidly recruited to the sites of chromosomal damage. The recruitment and subsequent function of this complex are critical for maintaining genomic stability, an essential component in the prevention of oncogenic transformations. Through a series of in vitro assays utilizing advanced CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing techniques, coupled with high-resolution microscopy and mass spectrometry, our research further establishes that the activity of the resolvasome is modulated by post-translational modifications in response to cellular stressors. Moreover, in vivo experiments conducted in Mus musculus models have demonstrated that a deficiency in the proper assembly of the resolvasome results in heightened sensitivity to ionizing radiation, leading to increased rates of apoptosis within highly proliferative tissues. Collectively, these findings present the resolvasome as a potential therapeutic target for the development of novel treatments addressing a wide array of pathologies, from inherited disorders of genomic instability to malignancies characterized by DNA repair defects.
