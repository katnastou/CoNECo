prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: CENP-T-W-S-X. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: Recent advancements in understanding the architecture of the kinetochore have elucidated the pivotal role of the CENP-T-W-S-X protein complex in chromosomal stability and alignment during mitosis. The intricate interaction of this protein complex appears to be integral in the recruitment of microtubules, suggesting a foundational role in the maintenance of genomic integrity. In our latest study, we have employed a combination of cryo-electron microscopy and super-resolution fluorescence imaging to dissect the spatial organization of the CENP-T-W-S-X complex within the kinetochore of *Homo sapiens* cells. By doing so, we aimed to decipher its potential regulatory mechanisms and interaction network during the cell cycle. Preliminary results indicate that CENP-T-W-S-X may be significantly involved in the response to mitotic stress, often induced by chemotherapeutic agents such as paclitaxel. These findings hint at a novel target for therapeutic intervention in the treatment of aneuploidy-driven malignancies, such as colorectal cancer, and underscore the necessity for further research into the dynamics of this essential protein complex.
