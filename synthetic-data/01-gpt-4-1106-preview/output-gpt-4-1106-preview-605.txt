prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: HCN3 channel. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The recently conducted study investigated the neurophysiological effects elicited by the modulation of the HCN3 channel in murine models of chronic pain. Employing patch-clamp electrophysiology, the researchers characterized the distinct biophysical properties of the HCN3 channel and assessed its distribution within nociceptive pathways. The analysis revealed a significant upregulation of the HCN3 channel expression in dorsal root ganglia neurons following induction of a persistent inflammatory state with complete Freund's adjuvant. Behavioral assays demonstrated that pharmacological blockade of the HCN3 channel resulted in a marked attenuation of pain behaviors, suggesting a pivotal role for this channel in the maintenance of inflammatory pain. Furthermore, in vivo administration of a selective HCN3 channel antagonist exhibited a pronounced analgesic effect without apparent adverse systemic effects, indicating the therapeutic potential of targeting this channel in pain management strategies. Continuous infusion of the antagonist via osmotic minipumps revealed sustained pain relief, reinforcing the hypothesis that HCN3 channel activity modulates pain signaling. Consequently, this research provides a foundational contribution to the understanding of ion channel involvement in pain modulation and opens new avenues for the development of targeted analgesics with fewer off-target interactions compared to currently available treatments.
