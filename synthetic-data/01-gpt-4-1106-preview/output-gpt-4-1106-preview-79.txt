prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: gamma-tubulin large. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we investigated the role of the gamma-tubulin large complex in the organization of microtubules within proliferating neuronal precursors. Microtubule networks are crucial for cell division and differentiation, particularly in the context of neurogenesis. Immunocytochemical analysis of rat hippocampal cultures demonstrated a pronounced colocalization of the gamma-tubulin large complex with acetylated Î±-tubulin at centrosomes, hinting at its potential role in microtubule nucleation during the S-phase of the cell cycle. Treatment of cultures with nocodazole, a microtubule-depolymerizing agent, resulted in the dispersion of the gamma-tubulin large complex from these sites, suggesting a dynamic association with microtubule organizing centers. Furthermore, quantification of neurite length post-nocodazole exposure revealed a significant retardation of neurite extension, underscoring the importance of the gamma-tubulin large complex in maintaining cytoarchitecture critical for cellular processes such as migration and synaptic connectivity. These findings may provide a novel perspective on neuronal development disorders, where improper microtubule assembly and function are known to play a pivotal role. Our observations promote the gamma-tubulin large as a potential therapeutic target for pharmacological intervention in diseases characterized by neurogenesis abnormalities.
