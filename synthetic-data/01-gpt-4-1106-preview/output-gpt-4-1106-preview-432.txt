prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: CDK8 kinase module. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The multifaceted role of the CDK8 kinase module in transcriptional regulation has been a subject of considerable interest in recent oncological studies. This protein complex has been implicated in modulating the activity of RNA polymerase II, thus influencing the expression of genes critical for cell cycle progression and apoptotic pathways. In vitro analyses have demonstrated that the inhibition of the CDK8 kinase module can significantly alter the phosphorylation status of serine residues on the carboxy-terminal domain of RNA polymerase II, resulting in downstream effects on chromatin structure and gene expression profiles. Further, aberrant activity of this complex has been associated with the pathology of colorectal cancer, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target. Small molecule inhibitors have been formulated to disrupt the function of the CDK8 kinase module, with preliminary evaluations in murine models showing a reduction in tumor proliferation and an increase in chemosensitivity. The ongoing clinical trials aim to decipher the complex pharmacokinetics and potential off-target effects of these inhibitors to optimize their efficacy and safety profile for use in human patients.
