prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: AMPA glutamate receptor. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In a recent study aimed at enhancing our understanding of synaptic plasticity, the role of the AMPA glutamate receptor in modulating long-term potentiation (LTP) was rigorously examined. The hippocampus of adult Sprague Dawley rats served as the primary model system for these investigations. Stimulation protocols designed to mimic physiological neuronal activity demonstrated that facilitation of LTP was closely related to the modulation of AMPA glutamate receptor function. Interesting correlations were observed between the receptor's activity and the intracellular concentrations of calcium ions, suggesting a potential calcium-dependent regulatory mechanism. Furthermore, pharmacological interventions using selective antagonists provided insights into the AMPA glutamate receptor's influence on neurotransmission and its potential implications in neurological conditions such as epilepsy. Quantitative immunoblotting and high-resolution electrophysiological recordings were employed to assess the receptor's expression and function, which confirmed the vital role the AMPA glutamate receptor plays in synaptic plasticity and cognitive processes. Importantly, this research contributes to the potential development of therapeutic strategies targeting the AMPA glutamate receptor to ameliorate the symptoms of neurological disorders characterized by compromised synaptic function.
