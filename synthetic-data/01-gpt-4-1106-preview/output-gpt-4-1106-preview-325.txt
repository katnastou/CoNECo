prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: DPNH-coenzyme Q reductase. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In a recent study investigating the cascade of molecular interactions involved in mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation, attention was focused on elucidating the role of the DPNH-coenzyme Q reductase complex within the inner mitochondrial membrane of murine models. This complex has long been considered pivotal in the electron transport chain, facilitating the transfer of electrons from NADH to coenzyme Q, thereby generating a proton gradient essential for ATP synthesis. The kinetic parameters of DPNH-coenzyme Q reductase were meticulously measured under various experimental conditions, revealing a marked influence of pH and temperature on its activity. Moreover, in trials involving tissue samples from mice models genetically predisposed to myocardial infarction, the activity of DPNH-coenzyme Q reductase was found to be significantly reduced as compared to controls, underscoring its potential involvement in cardiac disease pathology. These findings not only enhance the understanding of the enzyme's function but also suggest a crucial target for therapeutic intervention that could ameliorate energy production deficits in cardiac tissues. Continued exploration of DPNH-coenzyme Q reductase may yield further insights into the metabolic derangements characteristic of various cardiomyopathies, and provide a stepping stone for the development of novel strategies to combat mitochondrial dysfunction.
