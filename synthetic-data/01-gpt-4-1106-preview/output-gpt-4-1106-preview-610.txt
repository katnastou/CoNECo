prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: EMC. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In the recent study conducted to elucidate the intricacies of membrane protein biogenesis, the focus was primarily on characterizing the functional dynamics of EMC within the endoplasmic reticulum. This protein complex has been implicated in facilitating membrane protein insertion and folding, a process essential for maintaining cellular homeostasis. Through comprehensive in vivo and in vitro assays involving mammalian cell lines, the impacts of EMC on lipid bilayer composition were assessed, drawing particular attention to its role in modulating phospholipid saturation levels. The pharmacological intervention with agents such as brefeldin A further demonstrated the regulatory effects of EMC on secretory pathway activity, hinting at its potential involvement in diseases characterized by endoplasmic reticulum stress, such as diabetes and neurodegeneration. Significantly, the application of cryo-electron microscopy provided novel insights into the structural organization of the EMC, revealing conformational changes that occur in response to interaction with client membrane proteins. These findings underscore the complexity of protein homeostasis regulation and pave the way for targeted therapeutic strategies for conditions associated with protein misfolding and aggregation.
