prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: EKC. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In recent investigations, the protein complex EKC has emerged as a significant point of interest due to its multifaceted role in cellular regulation. This study sought to delineate the contributions of EKC to the maintenance of genomic integrity in mammalian cells. Utilizing a combination of advanced microscopy and biochemical assays, we observed that the absence of EKC led to a marked increase in chromosomal aberrations following induction of DNA damage by exposure to ionizing radiation. Remarkably, subsequent downstream analyses revealed that EKC is intricately involved in modulating the DNA damage response pathway, with particular influence on the repair machinery's ability to handle double-strand breaks. In model organisms, a reduction in EKC levels correlated with heightened sensitivity to genotoxic stress, pointing to its potential as a key regulator of cell survival under conditions of genomic insult. Moreover, exploring the therapeutic implications, our data suggest that small molecules capable of modulating EKC activity could offer a novel approach to enhancing the efficacy of current cancer treatments that induce DNA damage as a mechanism of action. Further research into the precise mechanistic details of EKC's involvement in these crucial cellular processes is warranted to fully elucidate its role and harness its potential for clinical benefit.
