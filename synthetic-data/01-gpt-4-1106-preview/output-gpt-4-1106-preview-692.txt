prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: CURI. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In a recent landmark study, the protein complex referred to as CURI has garnered attention for its potential regulatory functions within the apoptosis pathway. Investigation into the intricate mechanisms by which CURI influences cell death in Homo sapiens has revealed that its activity is modulated by the cellular concentration of calcium ions. This finding suggests that CURI may serve as a pivotal mediator of calcium-dependent apoptotic signaling. Further experiments utilizing murine models of neurodegenerative diseases have implicated CURI in the pathogenesis of conditions such as Alzheimer's disease, highlighting its role in neuron loss when aberrantly activated. These insights into the function of CURI not only deepen our understanding of the molecular underpinnings of apoptosis but also open new avenues for therapeutic interventions targeting calcium dysregulation in a myriad of pathologies. Future studies are required to elucidate the precise interactions between CURI and other cellular components, with an emphasis on determining the structural basis for its role in calcium-mediated signaling pathways.
