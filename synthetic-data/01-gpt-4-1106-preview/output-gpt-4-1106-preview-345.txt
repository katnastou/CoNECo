prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: DNMT3B–3L. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: Recent studies have shed light on the intricate regulation of genomic methylation patterns, elucidating the role of the DNMT3B–3L protein complex in this critical epigenetic process. In this context, DNMT3B–3L has been implicated in the addition of methyl groups to cytosine residues within CpG islands, a modification that has profound effects on gene expression profiles and cellular differentiation pathways. In this article, we explore the molecular mechanisms by which DNMT3B–3L contributes to the establishment of de novo methylation marks during embryogenesis and its implications for the development of complex diseases such as cancer. Utilizing a combination of chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) and whole-genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS), we analyzed the genome-wide distribution and functional consequences of DNMT3B–3L-mediated methylation in both murine and human cell lines. Our data suggest that the precise targeting of DNMT3B–3L to specific genomic loci is influenced by the cellular context and is critical for the maintenance of genomic integrity and the suppression of aberrant gene activation. Continued investigation into the regulatory networks governing DNMT3B–3L activity is necessary to understand the full spectrum of its biological significance and to inform potential therapeutic strategies for diseases associated with dysregulated methylation patterns.
