prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: SF3B. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: Recent advancements in our understanding of spliceosome function have elucidated the critical role of SF3B within the pre-mRNA splicing machinery. SF3B, a protein complex integral to the spliceosomal U2 snRNP, has been demonstrated to be pivotally involved in branch point recognition during the splicing process. This recognition is essential for the precise excision of introns and ligation of exons, leading to the mature mRNA transcript. In a groundbreaking study, the inhibition of SF3B was found to lead to a cascade of splicing aberrations, ultimately resulting in widespread disruptions in mRNA profiles within human cell lines. Notably, the perturbations in splicing were correlated with the onset of specific types of leukemia, suggesting a potential therapeutic target in the treatment of hematologic malignancies. Moreover, the specificity of SF3B for certain branch point sequences has underscored its potential as a selective therapeutic target, given that small molecule modulators of SF3B may confer the ability to tailor treatments based on the individual splicing signatures of patients. The implications of these findings are vast, pointing to the prospect of developing novel treatment modalities that target the splicing machinery at the level of SF3B to combat various pathologies.
