prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: PAXT. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The precise modulation of RNA stability plays a crucial role in the maintenance of cellular homeostasis and function. Emerging evidence indicates that the PAXT connection, a protein complex implicated in RNA decay, serves as a key modulator of RNA homeostasis within eukaryotic cells. Studies have demonstrated that PAXT interacts with the nuclear exosome targeting (NEXT) complex, facilitating the degradation of aberrant nuclear RNA species and thus preserving the integrity of the transcriptome. Dysregulation of PAXT activity has been associated with an array of pathophysiological conditions, including neurodegenerative diseases and cancer. For instance, in the context of Huntington's disease, an improvement of symptoms was observed upon the pharmacological manipulation of components interfacing with PAXT, suggesting a potential therapeutic avenue. Quantitative analyses through techniques such as RNA-seq have revealed that cells deficient in PAXT exhibit an aberrant accumulation of polyadenylated RNAs, underscoring the complex's role in RNA quality control. Moreover, it is postulated that PAXT may have a broader biological impact by influencing RNA-mediated regulatory mechanisms, thus affecting the expression of key enzymes and signaling molecules in response to cellular stressors. This highlights the importance of the PAXT complex in the nexus of transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation, with significant implications for understanding the molecular pathology underlying various human diseases and the development of novel therapeutics targeting RNA decay pathways.
