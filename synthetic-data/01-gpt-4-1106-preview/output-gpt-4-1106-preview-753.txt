prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: DPD. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In the present study, we sought to elucidate the functional properties and therapeutic potential of the DPD complex in cellular metabolism. Our investigation involved rigorous biochemical assays that uncovered the pivotal role DPD plays in the catabolism of pyrimidines, which are essential for nucleotide turnover in various organisms, including Homo sapiens. Perturbations in the activity of DPD were observed to correlate with altered levels of uracil and thymine, suggesting a direct impact on nucleotide homeostasis. More importantly, in the context of cancer biology, we identified that certain neoplasms exhibit dysregulated DPD activity, which has profound implications for chemotherapy resistance. Patients suffering from these malignancies often demonstrate a compromised response to fluoropyrimidine-based therapeutic agents, underscoring the urgent need for screening protocols that assess DPD function prior to treatment initiation. Our findings advocate for a more personalized approach to cancer therapy, where the assessment of DPD activity could inform the optimization of drug dosages, potentially mitigating adverse drug reactions and improving clinical outcomes.
