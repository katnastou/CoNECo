prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: ESCRT-2. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In the recent study published in the Journal of Molecular Biology, researchers have elucidated the pivotal role of ESCRT-2 in the context of viral budding from host cells. The endosomal sorting complexes required for transport, among which ESCRT-2 is a critical member, are known to facilitate the membrane scission events that are essential for the release of certain viruses, including HIV-1. This study employed sophisticated live-cell imaging techniques alongside biochemical assays to investigate the temporal dynamics of ESCRT-2 during the late stages of the viral life cycle. Results indicated that ESCRT-2 is transiently recruited to the sites of viral assembly within the plasma membrane, where it coordinates with other cellular machinery to catalyze membrane fission. Importantly, inhibition of ESCRT-2 function via specific molecular inhibitors led to a marked decrease in viral particle release, underscoring the complex's critical contribution to this process. These findings not only augment our understanding of cell-vesicle formation but also suggest potential therapeutic interventions in viral diseases by targeting ESCRT-2-mediated pathways. Further exploration of the precise molecular interactions within ESCRT-2 and its regulation will be integral in unravelling the complexities of vesicular trafficking and viral egress.
