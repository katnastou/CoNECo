prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: PMM-2. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In a recent study aimed at elucidating the underlying mechanisms of cellular metabolism, PMM-2 has emerged as a critical protein complex with a significant role in modulating biochemical pathways. This study employed a multidisciplinary approach, including mass spectrometry and cryo-electron microscopy, to unravel the structural intricacies and functional dynamics of PMM-2 within hepatic cells. The experimental model, utilizing Mus musculus as a subject, demonstrated that alterations in PMM-2 expression levels were associated with marked changes in glycolytic and gluconeogenic flux, suggesting a potential regulatory role in glucose homeostasis. Furthermore, when examining the pathological tissues from patients diagnosed with type II diabetes, a consistent dysregulation of PMM-2 was observed, implicating its involvement in the etiology of metabolic diseases. This association highlights the importance of PMM-2 not only as a biomolecular agent in energy metabolism but also as a prospective target for therapeutic intervention. The findings open avenues for novel drug development strategies aiming to modulate PMM-2 activity and restore metabolic equilibrium in affected individuals.
