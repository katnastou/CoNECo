prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: CydDC. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In the recent study, the role of the CydDC protein complex was elucidated in the context of bacterial respiratory adaptations under oxidative stress. Research on Escherichia coli models demonstrated that the CydDC complex plays a pivotal role in maintaining intracellular redox equilibrium, particularly in environments with fluctuating oxygen levels. Upon exposure to hydrogen peroxide, a known inducer of oxidative stress, cells deficient in CydDC exhibited a decrease in viability as compared to the wild-type controls. This phenotype suggests that the CydDC complex may contribute to the detoxification pathways or repair mechanisms that mitigate oxidative damage. Further biochemical assays revealed that the integrity of cellular membranes was compromised in the absence of CydDC, linking the complex to potential membrane-stabilizing functions essential during oxidative stress. The exploration of the CydDC complex in disease models, such as in the context of cystic fibrosis pathogens, may open new avenues for targeted therapeutic interventions aiming to disrupt bacterial resilience to host defense mechanisms. Given the growing concerns of antibiotic resistance, a deeper understanding of the CydDC complex's role remains a pressing need within the biomedical field.
