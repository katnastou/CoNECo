prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: fibrillar collagen trimer. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The architecture of the extracellular matrix is significantly influenced by the presence of the fibrillar collagen trimer, a protein complex integral to the maintenance of structural integrity in various tissues. In a recent study, the biomechanical properties of this complex were analyzed in the context of wound healing in Mus musculus models. The fidelity of skin regeneration was observed to correlate with the abundance and proper assembly of the fibrillar collagen trimer, indicating its essential role in tissue repair processes. Furthermore, subjects with a predisposition to fibrosis exhibited an abnormal accumulation of this protein complex, suggesting a potential therapeutic target for managing the disease. In vitro analysis of the trimer's interaction with common extracellular molecules such as hyaluronic acid highlighted a nuanced interplay that appears to modulate cellular adhesion and migration. It is proposed that elucidation of the mechanistic pathways governing the assembly and function of the fibrillar collagen trimer could yield insights into the etiology of connective tissue disorders and aid in the development of novel clinical interventions.
