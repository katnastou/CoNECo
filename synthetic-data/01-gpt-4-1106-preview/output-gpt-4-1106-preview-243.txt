prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: Sec6/8. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we sought to elucidate the role of the Sec6/8 complex in the assembly of exocyst complexes within mammalian cells. The Sec6/8 complex was hypothesized to play a pivotal role in the vesicular transport system, mediating the tethering of secretory vesicles to specific domains on the plasma membrane. To investigate this, we utilized a combination of fluorescence microscopy and biochemical assays to track the localization and function of the Sec6/8 complex during the exocytotic process. Our findings revealed that disruption of the Sec6/8 complex significantly impaired the targeted delivery of vesicles, leading to an accumulation of secretory cargo within the cytoplasm. Additionally, we observed that cells with compromised Sec6/8 activity exhibited signs of cellular stress, as evidenced by the upregulation of heat shock proteins and an increased susceptibility to apoptosis upon stimulation with pro-apoptotic agents such as staurosporine. These data suggest that the Sec6/8 complex is integral not only to vesicular trafficking but also to maintaining cellular homeostasis. Importantly, this work sheds light on potential pathophysiological mechanisms where dysregulation of vesicle trafficking may contribute to the development of diseases, including neurodegenerative disorders and diabetes, where cellular secretion pathways are known to be defective.
