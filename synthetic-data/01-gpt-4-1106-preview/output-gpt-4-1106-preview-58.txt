prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: P-ATAC. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In our recent investigation, we characterized the functional involvement of the protein complex P-ATAC in a murine model of cardiac hypertrophy. P-ATAC's role was evaluated through an array of biochemical assays following the induction of hypertrophic stimuli via the administration of isoproterenol. Histological analyses demonstrated an increase in cardiac muscle fiber size that correlated with elevated levels of P-ATAC in both cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions. Furthermore, echocardiographic measurements revealed a consequential thickening of the ventricular walls, reinforcing the presumptive hypertrophic process. To decipher the underlying mechanisms, we treated the animal subjects with a selective inhibitor of P-ATAC and observed a significant attenuation of hypertrophic markers, suggesting a direct involvement of this protein complex in the transduction of hypertrophic signals within cardiomyocytes. The elucidation of P-ATAC's function provides a foundation for potential therapeutic strategies aimed at mitigating pathological cardiac remodeling in diseases such as hypertensive heart disease and dilated cardiomyopathy. Notably, no off-target effects were observed in renal or hepatic functions, underscoring the specificity of P-ATAC's role in cardiac physiology. Future studies are set to explore the signal transduction pathways upstream and downstream of P-ATAC to fully understand its regulatory network and potential as a pharmacological target.
