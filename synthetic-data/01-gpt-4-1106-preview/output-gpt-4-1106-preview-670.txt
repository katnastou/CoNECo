prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: TRanscription/EXport. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we explored the role of the TRanscription/EXport (TREX) complex in the regulation of mRNA processing and nuclear export, particularly in the context of cellular responses to oxidative stress. We utilized human fibroblast cells exposed to hydrogen peroxide to mimic oxidative stress conditions and tracked the localization and function of the TREX complex within these cells. Through immunofluorescence microscopy, we observed a relocalization of the TREX complex from the nucleus to the cytoplasm following oxidative insult, suggesting a potential stress-responsive mechanism. Subsequent RNA-seq analysis of the fibroblasts revealed an altered mRNA export profile, with a subset of mRNAs showing increased cytoplasmic accumulation. This shift in mRNA export was correlated with changes in cell survival pathways, indicating a role for the TREX complex in cellular adaptation to oxidative damage. Our findings offer novel insight into the dynamic regulation of mRNA processing and export in the maintenance of cellular homeostasis and may have implications for understanding the molecular underpinnings of diseases associated with oxidative stress, such as neurodegenerative disorders and cancer.
