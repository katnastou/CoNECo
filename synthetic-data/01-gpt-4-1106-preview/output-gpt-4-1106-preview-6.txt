prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: ESCRT-IV. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The recent studies focusing on endosomal sorting and the mechanisms underlying membrane abscission have brought to light the critical role played by the ESCRT-IV complex. This protein complex has been implicated in the late stages of cytokinesis, demonstrating its vital function in cell division. The distinct biochemical activities of ESCRT-IV facilitate the separation of the two nascent cells at the conclusion of mitosis, ensuring proper distribution of the cellular contents. Notably, dysregulation of this complex has been associated with an array of pathological conditions, including neurodegenerative diseases, where aberrant membrane trafficking and protein aggregation are hallmark features. The exploration of ESCRT-IV's interaction with specific lipid species, such as phosphatidylinositol phosphates, has unveiled a nuanced regulatory mechanism, where lipid-protein interactions are central to the temporal and spatial control of membrane fission events. Further elucidation of the precise molecular architecture of ESCRT-IV, coupled with high-resolution imaging of its dynamics in vivo, promises to expand our understanding of its essential functions in maintaining cellular homeostasis and has potential therapeutic implications for diseases arising from membrane trafficking defects.
