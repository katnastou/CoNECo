prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: retromer CSC. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In the present study, we sought to elucidate the role of the retromer CSC in neuronal health and its potential implications in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease. Cultured primary neurons derived from murine models were exposed to beta-amyloid oligomers, a hallmark pathological agent associated with Alzheimer's disease, to assess the involvement of retromer CSC in cellular response mechanisms. The neurons demonstrated an increased expression of oxidative stress markers and underwent synaptic alterations, which paralleled the dysregulation of the retromer CSC. Notably, pharmacological modulation of endosomal function suggested a rescue effect on the observed pathologies when retromer CSC integrity was supported. Moreover, immunoprecipitation assays confirmed the presence of phosphorylated tau, a pathological species implicated in neurofibrillary tangle formation, in close proximity to compromised retromer CSC. These findings offer novel insights into the neuroprotective functions of retromer CSC and its significance in maintaining synaptic homeostasis, potentially influencing the development of therapeutic strategies for neurodegenerative diseases. Further in vivo studies and clinical trials are required to fully establish the therapeutic potential of targeting retromer CSC stabilization in Alzheimer's disease intervention.
