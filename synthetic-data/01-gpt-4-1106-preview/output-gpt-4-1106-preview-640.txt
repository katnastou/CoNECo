prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: AM1. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: Recent advances in the characterization of protein complex AM1 have elucidated its potential regulatory role in cellular metabolism. Initially identified through a high-throughput proteomic screening in human hepatocytes, AM1 has been implicated in the modulation of mitochondrial function, with subsequent impacts on cellular respiration and ATP synthesis. Accumulating evidence, gathered through both in vitro and in vivo studies, demonstrates that the presence of AM1 correlates with enhanced tolerance to oxidative stress, suggesting a protective role against reactive oxygen species (ROS). Notably, overexpression of AM1 in murine models has been associated with an attenuated progression of metabolic disorders, including Type 2 diabetes and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. The mechanistic underpinnings of AM1's activity appear to be linked to its interaction with key metabolic pathways, including glycolysis and the citric acid cycle. Moreover, pharmacological modulation of AM1 has been posited as a novel therapeutic strategy, particularly in the context of metabolic syndrome where efficient energy production and management of oxidative stress are critical. Further research is warranted to fully decipher the complex network of interactions involving AM1 and to harness its potential in clinical applications.
