prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: Set3. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In the ongoing quest to elucidate the intricate mechanisms of epigenetic regulation, recent attention has converged upon the histone deacetylase activities of the protein complex Set3. These studies have revealed that Set3 plays a pivotal role in chromatin remodeling, a process essential for the transcriptional control within the Saccharomyces cerevisiae model organism. Notably, treatment of yeast cells with trichostatin A, a potent histone deacetylase inhibitor, results in a marked decrease in the repressive chromatin marks normally attributed to Set3 function. This discovery suggests that Set3 may serve as a potential therapeutic target in diseases characterized by aberrant chromatin states, such as cancers and neurodegenerative disorders. Moreover, global transcriptome analysis under Set3 perturbation has demonstrated its relevance in the regulation of metabolic pathways, particularly those involving glucose metabolism. Further research is required to delineate the full spectrum of Set3 interactions and its consequential impact on cellular homeostasis. These findings underscore the complexity of epigenetic modulation and the imperative need to dissect the role of protein complexes such as Set3 in physiological and pathological contexts.
