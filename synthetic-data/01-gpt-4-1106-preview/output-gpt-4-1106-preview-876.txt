prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: BDC. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In the recent study conducted by Zhao et al., the biological implications of the protein complex BDC were examined in the context of cellular stress responses. The research aimed at elucidating the role of BDC in the modulation of autophagy pathways under oxidative stress in rat hepatocytes. Administration of hydrogen peroxide was utilized to induce oxidative stress, leading to the upregulation of BDC expression. Quantitative proteomics analyses suggested that BDC potentially interacts with key regulators of autophagy, implying a cytoprotective mechanism in hepatocellular homeostasis. Intriguingly, the inhibition of BDC resulted in decreased cell viability and an increase in apoptosis markers, highlighting its significance as a potential therapeutic target. Furthermore, the pharmacological modulation of BDC activity using small molecule inhibitors was explored, revealing attenuation in autophagic flux disruption caused by oxidative stress. This suggests the important role of BDC in maintaining cellular integrity and its possible relevance in liver diseases characterized by excessive autophagic activity or oxidative damage, such as nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). The findings from this study open new avenues for investigating the therapeutic potential of BDC in hepatic pathologies and underscore the necessity for further in-depth mechanistic studies to fully understand the breadth of BDC's functions in the cellular stress response.
