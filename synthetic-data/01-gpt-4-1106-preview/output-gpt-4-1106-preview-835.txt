prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: plus-end kinesin. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In recent studies concerning intracellular transport mechanisms, the role of the plus-end kinesin protein complex has garnered significant attention in the context of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's. The plus-end kinesin is integral to the anterograde transport of vesicles along microtubules, directing them toward the synapse. This study investigated the modulation of plus-end kinesin activity in response to varying concentrations of calcium ions within the axonal environment of cultured murine neurons. Utilizing immunofluorescence microscopy, we observed that increased calcium levels correlate with enhanced recruitment of the plus-end kinesin to microtubule paths, suggesting a calcium-mediated regulatory mechanism. Furthermore, pharmacological inhibition of calmodulin-dependent kinase II, an enzyme known to be influenced by intracellular calcium, resulted in a marked decrease in plus-end kinesin-based transport. The implications of these findings may extend to the understanding of synaptic dysfunction in various neuropathologies, highlighting the potential for therapeutic interventions targeting the regulation of plus-end kinesin activity to mitigate the progression of neuronal disorders.
