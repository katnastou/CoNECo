prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: VLA-3. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In a recent exploration into the fundamental mechanisms underlying cell adhesion and signaling in fibroblasts, attention has centered on the role of VLA-3 protein complex in mediating interactions with the extracellular matrix. This complex has been implicated in the regulation of cellular processes ranging from migration to survival, demonstrating its versatility and importance. Functional assays reveal that VLA-3 exhibits a selective binding affinity for fibrinogen and fibronectin, suggesting a nuanced role in the organization of the extracellular milieu. Moreover, in vitro experiments utilizing a fibroblast culture system have shown that the expression levels of VLA-3 are modulated in response to inflammatory cytokines, implicating this protein complex in the pathophysiology of chronic inflammatory diseases. In murine models of wound healing, the perturbation of VLA-3 expression significantly delays the reparative process, underscoring its potential as a therapeutic target. Further investigation employing advanced proteomic and genomic techniques is warranted to elucidate the signaling pathways associated with VLA-3 and their downstream effects on cellular function. The ongoing study of this complex serves to advance our understanding of tissue remodelling and the intricate web of interactions that maintain cellular homeostasis.
