prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: IL-9 receptor. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In a recent landmark study, the engagement of the IL-9 receptor by its cognate cytokine has been further elucidated, offering novel insights into its role in immunoregulation. Upon ligand binding, the IL-9 receptor initiates a cascade of intracellular signaling events, culminating in the transcriptional activation of genes associated with cellular proliferation, differentiation, and survival. This is particularly relevant in the context of T-helper cell response, where the receptor's function appears to be integral to the orchestration of immune defenses. The activation of this signaling axis was observed to be contingent upon the availability of ATP and divalent cations, notably magnesium, underscoring the biochemical prerequisites for receptor function. Furthermore, aberrant IL-9 receptor activity has been implicated in the pathogenesis of several inflammatory disorders, including asthma and autoimmune diseases, thus designating it as a potential therapeutic target. Investigations utilizing murine models have revealed that disruptions in this receptorâ€™s signaling pathway can significantly alter the disease course, further highlighting the therapeutic potential of modulating IL-9 receptor activity. Consequently, the exploration of small molecule inhibitors or monoclonal antibodies that selectively target the IL-9 receptor is a burgeoning area of translational research with immense clinical implications.
