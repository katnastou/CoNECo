prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: Janusin. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In the recent investigation delineating the role of Janusin in neurodevelopmental processes, a series of in-vitro assays complemented by in-vivo studies employing murine models have shed light on this hitherto enigmatic protein complex. Janusin expression was found to be critically modulated during the embryonic stages, particularly influencing neural crest cell migration. Utilizing immunohistochemistry, Janusin was localized predominantly within the proliferative zones of the developing cortex, suggesting its involvement in the modulation of neuronal progenitor cell dynamics. Pharmacological intervention using specific kinase inhibitors revealed that Janusin activity is markedly sensitive to intracellular signaling pathways typically initiated by growth factors. Furthermore, quantitative proteomics identified several interacting partners, implicating Janusin in a network that orchestrates cell adhesion and cytoskeletal organization. This discovery is particularly poignant considering the aberrant expression levels of Janusin observed in tissue samples derived from subjects diagnosed with autism spectrum disorders (ASD), pointing to its potential role in the etiology of this complex condition. Collectively, these findings underscore the importance of Janusin as a critical player in neural development and offer novel insights into the molecular underpinnings of neurodevelopmental diseases.
