prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: NEF3. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In a recent study published in the *Journal of Molecular Biology*, we assessed the functional role of the nucleotide exchange factor 3 (NEF3) in cellular autophagy mechanisms. Our experimental design included both in vitro and in vivo models, where we aimed to elucidate the impact of NEF3 expression on the autophagic flux in response to nutrient deprivation. Through a series of kinase assay analyses, we observed that NEF3 facilitates the phosphorylation of key enzymes associated with autophagosome formation, signifying its potential regulatory influence in the autophagic pathway. Furthermore, murine models genetically modified to overexpress NEF3 demonstrated an enhanced clearance of damaged mitochondria, suggesting that NEF3 may play a crucial role in mitophagy, a selective form of autophagy. This was further corroborated by our findings in human cell lines where NEF3 overexpression resulted in increased resistance to oxidative stress, a common feature associated with neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's disease. These results propose that NEF3 is a critical modulator of cellular homeostasis and could serve as a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of disorders related to dysfunctional autophagy.
