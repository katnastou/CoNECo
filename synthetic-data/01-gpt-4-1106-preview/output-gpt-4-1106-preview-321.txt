prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: condensin I. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In a recent study published in the International Journal of Cell Biology, researchers have elucidated the critical role of condensin I in chromosomal architecture and segregation during mitosis. The experimental approach comprised both in vivo and in vitro assays, utilizing advanced microscopy techniques to observe the dynamics of chromosome condensation in cultured human fibroblasts. The analysis revealed that the presence of condensin I is paramount for the maintenance of structural chromosome integrity, particularly during the prophase stage of the cell cycle. Disruption of condensin I function, induced by a targeted small molecule inhibitor, led to aberrant mitotic figures and an increased incidence of aneuploidy. This phenotype underscores the potential consequences of condensin I dysfunction, which may contribute to the onset of genomic instability, a hallmark of cancerous transformations. The study further delves into the temporal regulation of condensin I, proposing a model whereby the phosphorylation state of the complex orchestrates its chromosome binding affinity. These findings provide valuable insights into the molecular mechanisms that safeguard proper cell division and highlight the potential for developing novel therapeutic strategies targeting condensin I to combat chromosomal aberration-related diseases.
