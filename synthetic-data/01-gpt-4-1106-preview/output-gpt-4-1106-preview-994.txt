prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: NoRC. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: Recent advancements in chromatin remodeling have highlighted the pivotal role of the nucleolar remodeling complex (NoRC) in the epigenetic regulation of ribosomal RNA genes. The NoRC, a dynamic architectural protein complex, is integral to the establishment of heterochromatin regions and transcriptional silencing within nucleolar domains. In our study, we investigated the impact of NoRC-mediated chromatin modifications on the cellular response to oxidative stress. Utilizing a model organism, *Saccharomyces cerevisiae*, we observed that cells exhibiting reduced activity of the NoRC showed an increased expression of stress-responsive genes, suggesting a potential release of transcriptional repression in these genomic regions. Moreover, through the application of chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing (ChIP-seq), we identified a series of loci that displayed altered histone methylation profiles, which could be directly attributed to NoRC functionality. Interestingly, cells with impaired NoRC activity exhibited an increased sensitivity to the DNA-damaging agent, etoposide, indicating a possible link between NoRC activity and the DNA damage repair pathway. These findings could have significant implications for understanding the molecular mechanisms underpinning diseases associated with genomic instability, such as cancer, and propose a novel facet to the NoRC that warrants further exploration.
