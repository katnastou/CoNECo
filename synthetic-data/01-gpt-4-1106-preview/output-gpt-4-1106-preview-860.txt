prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: PGGTase-I. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In recent investigations on the regulation of protein prenylation within cellular processes, PGGTase-I has been implicated as a crucial enzyme facilitating the post-translational modification of specific substrate proteins through the attachment of a 20-carbon geranylgeranyl group. This protein complex reveals a remarkable specificity towards substrates with CAAX motifs, where 'C' stands for cysteine, 'A' for aliphatic amino acids, and 'X' for the C-terminal amino acid, which determines enzyme recognition. The perturbation of PGGTase-I activity has been associated with various cellular dysfunctions, often leading to aberrant cell growth and proliferation, thereby underscoring its potential role in the pathogenesis of cancer. Inhibition studies utilizing small molecules have highlighted the potential therapeutic benefits of targeting PGGTase-I in oncology, particularly given its involvement in the post-translational modification of proteins that are crucial for malignant transformation and metastasis. Moreover, PGGTase-I has been identified as a promising biological marker for chemotherapeutic response, serving as a predictive tool for evaluating the efficacy of targeted treatments in neoplastic diseases. Investigations into PGGTase-I not only enhance our understanding of fundamental cellular biochemistry but also pave new avenues for the development of innovative strategies in combatting cancer.
