prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: ThiGH. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In our latest investigation to elucidate the metabolic pathways implicated in vitamin B1 (thiamine) biosynthesis, we focused on the intricate role of the ThiGH protein complex. This multifaceted complex plays a crucial part in the synthesis of thiamine pyrophosphate (TPP), the active form of the vitamin, which is pivotal for the enzyme activities in glucose metabolism. Utilizing Saccharomyces cerevisiae as a model organism, we observed that the absence of the ThiGH complex resulted in a marked decrease in cellular TPP levels, which in turn led to a series of metabolic dysregulations. These findings were further corroborated in a mammalian cell line, where perturbation of ThiGH levels paralleled similar metabolic inconsistencies. Intriguingly, the dysfunction of this complex showed a potential linkage to the pathogenesis of Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome, a disease characterized by severe neurological symptoms that arise from thiamine deficiency. Expanding on these foundational insights, our study highlights the indispensable role of the ThiGH protein complex within thiamine biosynthesis and its broader implications for metabolic and neurological health.
