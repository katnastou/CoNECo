prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: ssuABC. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In a groundbreaking study, researchers have illuminated the functional characteristics and potential therapeutic targets of the ssuABC protein complex. The ssuABC complex has been associated with the cellular process of ribonucleic acid (RNA) transport and degradation, revealing a novel mechanism that could potentially be exploited for intervention in specific pathologies of RNA metabolism. Using a combination of cryo-electron microscopy and X-ray crystallography, the structural configuration of the ssuABC was elucidated, highlighting its interaction with key cellular metabolites. Furthermore, in vitro assays demonstrated that the inhibition of ssuABC activity could influence the progression of certain cancers, suggesting a role for ssuABC in tumorigenesis. This discovery opens new avenues for pharmacological research, with the possibility of developing small molecules that can modulate the activity of this protein complex. Such therapeutic agents might eventually lead to new treatments for diseases where RNA transport and degradation pathways are dysregulated. The implications of these findings warrant further investigation into the ssuABC protein complex within the broader context of cellular homeostasis and disease.
