prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: Abetal. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we have characterized the structural and functional attributes of the novel protein complex Abetal and investigated its implication in Alzheimer's disease pathology. Affinity purification followed by mass spectrometry enabled us to identify the constituents of the Abetal complex in human neuronal cells. Subsequent in vitro assays indicated that Abetal has a propensity to bind amyloid-beta, suggesting a potential role in the modulation of amyloid plaque formation. The presence of Abetal was also observed to be upregulated in brain tissue samples obtained from individuals diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease, compared to age-matched controls. Additionally, our experiments utilizing murine models of neurodegeneration revealed that overexpression of Abetal correlates with reduced neurotoxicity and improves cognitive function, highlighting its neuroprotective capabilities. The findings propose that modulating the activity of Abetal could offer a novel therapeutic strategy to mitigate the progression of Alzheimer's disease. A pharmacological analysis has been initiated to screen compounds that could enhance the stability and function of Abetal, and their potential efficacy will be evaluated through a series of preclinical trials.
