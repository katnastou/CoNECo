prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: IF-2. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In the current study, we investigated the role of IF-2 in the initiation of translation in *Escherichia coli*. The importance of this protein complex in the assembly of the 30S initiation complex has been underscored by various in vitro assays. Utilizing ribosome profiling, we observed a significant decrease in translational efficiency upon the targeted knockdown of IF-2. Moreover, this knockdown led to a pronounced accumulation of uncharged tRNA molecules, suggesting a bottleneck at the initial stage of protein synthesis. The observations were further substantiated by cell viability assays, wherein cells deficient in IF-2 exhibited a marked decrease in growth rate when exposed to the antibiotic kanamycin, indicating a heightened sensitivity due to impaired protein biosynthesis. In addition, we employed fluorescence microscopy to visualize the spatial distribution of IF-2 in the cellular milieu, revealing a dispersed pattern throughout the cytoplasm, which becomes more concentrated around the nucleoid region in response to thermal stress. Collectively, our data illuminate the pivotal status of IF-2 in bacterial growth and response to environmental challenges, paving the way for potential therapeutic interventions targeting this protein complex in pathogenic strains.
