prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: eukaryotic translation elongation factor 1. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The role of eukaryotic translation elongation factor 1 in cellular protein synthesis is a critical aspect of understanding the mechanism of translation in the eukaryotic ribosome. Recent studies have investigated the interaction between this protein complex and various mRNA transcripts during the elongation phase of protein synthesis, revealing insights into the fidelity and regulation of polypeptide assembly. For instance, in a recent in vitro experiment using Saccharomyces cerevisiae extracts, it was observed that the presence of eukaryotic translation elongation factor 1 significantly increased the rate at which aminoacyl-tRNAs were delivered to the A-site of the ribosome. This suggests that the protein complex not only facilitates translation elongation but also plays a role in the kinetics of that process. Moreover, abnormalities in the function of this complex have been associated with the pathogenesis of certain neurological disorders, emphasizing the importance of its proper operation in maintaining cellular homeostasis. The study of eukaryotic translation elongation factor 1, therefore, continues to be paramount in the fields of molecular biology and pathology, with implications for the development of potential therapeutic agents.
