prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: septin. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In the present study, we explored the regulatory roles of the septin complex during mitotic progression in mammalian cells. The septin complex, a critical component of the cytoskeleton, is known for its involvement in various cellular processes, including cytokinesis and membrane compartmentalization. We employed immunofluorescence microscopy to visualize the spatial distribution of the septin complex throughout the cell cycle, and observed a remarkable reorganization during mitotic spindle formation. Furthermore, utilizing small molecule inhibitors, we probed the septin complex's interactions with microtubule-associated proteins, revealing a potential mechanism for septin-mediated mitotic spindle stabilization. Disruption of septin complex dynamics by chemical agents resulted in aberrant mitotic phenotypes, leading to aneuploidy in cultured human cell lines. In support of these findings, our in vivo studies using murine models illustrated that unregulated activity of the septin complex could contribute to the pathophysiology of disorders characterized by mitotic anomalies, suggesting a novel avenue for therapeutic intervention in cancers marked by heightened cell division rates. These results underscore the septin complex as a pivotal orchestrator of mitotic integrity, providing insights into its potential as a target for pharmacological modulation.
