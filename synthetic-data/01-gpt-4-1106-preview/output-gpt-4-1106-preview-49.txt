prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: MsbA. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In a recent study, the role of the protein complex MsbA in lipid A transport and antibiotic resistance was elucidated using a combination of X-ray crystallography and cryo-electron microscopy techniques. The multifaceted approach revealed that MsbA, an ATP-binding cassette transporter, is essential for the proper assembly and function of the outer membrane in Gram-negative bacteria. The asymmetric conformation of MsbA in its ATP-bound state suggests a novel mechanism of action, wherein the protein complex alternates between inward- and outward-facing conformations to effectively translocate lipid A across the inner membrane. Further biochemical assays indicated that perturbations in MsbA activity led to increased sensitivity of bacterial cells to a range of antibiotics, specifically those targeting the cell envelope. This finding underlines the potential of MsbA as a therapeutic target for antibacterial drug development. Moreover, the study of MsbA interactions with lipid A analogs provided insights into the structural features critical for substrate specificity and the initiation of the lipid A export process, advancing the current understanding of antibiotic resistance mechanisms at the molecular level. The implications of this research are particularly significant in the context of combatting multidrug-resistant bacterial infections, which continue to pose a challenge to global public health.
