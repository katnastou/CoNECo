prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: mSWI/SNF. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In an effort to further elucidate the mechanistic pathways underlying colorectal cancer, recent investigations have focused on chromatin remodeling complexes and their role in gene regulation. Among these, the mSWI/SNF complex has emerged as a critical player. The current study aimed to assess the impact of mSWI/SNF on the transcriptional landscape of colorectal carcinoma cells. To approach this, we utilized CRISPR-Cas9 mediated knock-out models to disrupt the function of mSWI/SNF and then conducted whole-genome transcriptome analysis through RNA sequencing. Subsequent bioinformatics analysis revealed that the loss of mSWI/SNF function resulted in the significant downregulation of genes associated with cell proliferation and DNA repair. Furthermore, chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing (ChIP-seq) demonstrated a widespread alteration in the chromatin accessibility landscape, implying that mSWI/SNF is indispensable for the maintenance of an active chromatin state in regions imperative for tumor suppressor gene expression. The findings provide compelling evidence that mSWI/SNF plays a pivotal role in the maintenance of genomic integrity and suggests its potential as a therapeutic target in colorectal cancer treatment modalities. The intricate relationship between mSWI/SNF and cellular metabolism also warrants further exploration, particularly in the context of targeted cancer therapies that could disrupt tumor cell energy homeostasis.
