prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: R2TP. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we examined the role of the R2TP complex in the cellular response to thermal stress in a murine model. Previous investigations have elucidated that R2TP is implicated in the assembly and stabilization of various protein complexes, including those involved in RNA transcription and DNA repair. Our experiments sought to determine the extent to which R2TP contributes to the heat shock response, a vital cellular defense mechanism against elevated temperatures. Murine fibroblasts were subjected to a controlled heat shock at 42ËšC, following which the cells were analyzed for the expression levels of heat shock proteins (HSPs), known mediators of the proteostasis network during stress conditions. Concurrently, we administered a small molecule inhibitor specific to the HSP90 chaperone, a crucial interactor with R2TP, to dissect the dependency of the heat shock response on this complex. Immunoprecipitation assays were performed to investigate the physical interactions between R2TP and HSPs, providing insight into the mechanistic role of R2TP in cellular homeostasis maintenance during thermal stress. Our findings indicate that disruptions of R2TP activity lead to a pronounced attenuation of the heat shock response, underscoring its potential as a therapeutic target in diseases characterized by proteostasis imbalances. Further investigations are warranted to explore the therapeutic implications of these findings in the context of neurodegenerative diseases, where protein misfolding and aggregation are hallmarks of pathology.
