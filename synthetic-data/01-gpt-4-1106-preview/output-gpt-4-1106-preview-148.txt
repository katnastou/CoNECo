prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: NatC. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The recent strides in proteomics have illuminated the multifaceted roles of numerous protein complexes, amongst which NatC has emerged as a significant participant in post-translational modification processes. NatC has been implicated in the N-terminal acetylation of a subset of proteins, a modification which has far-reaching implications for protein stability, localization, and function. In this context, the present study sought to elucidate the involvement of NatC in cellular metabolism and its potential link to metabolic disorders. Utilizing a murine model, the hepatic expression of NatC was quantified under various metabolic states, including fasting and refeeding periods. Moreover, the phenotypic consequences of NatC dysfunction were assessed in a cohort of subjects with diagnosed metabolic syndrome. Findings indicate a correlation between altered NatC activity and irregular metabolic profiles, shedding light on the enigmatic role of this protein complex in maintaining metabolic homeostasis. While the study did not administer any pharmacological agents targeting NatC, it paves the way for future investigations exploring therapeutic interventions that modulate its activity. Collectively, these insights contribute to the overarching understanding of protein complex functions in the intricate web of biological systems, offering a novel perspective on the mechanistic underpinnings of metabolism-related diseases.
