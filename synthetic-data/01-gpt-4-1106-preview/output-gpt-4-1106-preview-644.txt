prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: TOR complex 2. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In a recent study published in the "Journal of Molecular Medicine," the signaling pathway mediated by TOR complex 2 was found to play a pivotal role in the regulation of cellular metabolism. This complex, which has been implicated in various physiological processes, was investigated within murine models to determine its influence on insulin sensitivity and lipid biosynthesis. Researchers used a targeted inhibitor that specifically impaired TOR complex 2 activity, and the subsequent metabolic outcomes were meticulously recorded. It was observed that the inhibition of TOR complex 2 led to a pronounced decrease in de novo lipogenesis within the liver tissues, suggesting a direct regulatory mechanism. Furthermore, the systemic analysis indicated an improvement in glucose homeostasis, hinting at the therapeutic potential of modulating this complex in the treatment of metabolic disorders such as type 2 diabetes. These findings demonstrate a critical interplay between TOR complex 2 and metabolic regulation, offering insights that may pave the way for novel pharmacological interventions in metabolic diseases.
