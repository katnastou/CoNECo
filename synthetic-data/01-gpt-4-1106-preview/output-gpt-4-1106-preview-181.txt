prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: membrane-bound IgG2b. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The recent study on the immunological response against Streptococcus pneumoniae infection has provided novel insights into the role of the membrane-bound IgG2b in host defense mechanisms. During the course of infection, subjects exhibited an upregulation of the membrane-bound IgG2b on B-cell surfaces, suggesting a critical role in antigen recognition and subsequent immune activation. The observation was consistent across various patient populations, regardless of age and comorbid conditions, indicating a broad relevance of this protein complex in adaptive immunity. Flow cytometry analysis of peripheral blood mononuclear cells revealed that the density of the membrane-bound IgG2b was directly correlated with the production of specific antibodies against the pathogen, reflecting its potential use as a biomarker for the efficacy of immune response. Furthermore, in vitro assays demonstrated that the disruption of the membrane-bound IgG2b's function led to a pronounced decrease in phagocytosis by macrophages, implicating its contribution to antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity. As the study progresses, elucidating the molecular pathways through which the membrane-bound IgG2b influences these immune processes may provide therapeutic targets for enhancing vaccine efficacy and developing novel treatments for bacterial infections.
