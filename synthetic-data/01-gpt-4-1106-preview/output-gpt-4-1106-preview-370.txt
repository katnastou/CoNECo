prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: N-terminal acetyltransferase B. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In a recent groundbreaking study, the role of N-terminal acetyltransferase B in apoptotic processes was examined. Typically, post-translational modifications are implicated in a wide array of cellular functions, with N-terminal acetylation being one of the key regulatory mechanisms. Previous research has indicated that dysregulation of such modifications can result in pathological conditions, including neurodegenerative diseases and cancer. The team used murine models to explore the impact of N-terminal acetyltransferase B's activity on neuronal cells subjected to oxidative stress. Utilizing an array of biochemical assays, immunoprecipitation, and mass spectrometry, the researchers were able to discern a significant protective role played by the protein complex. Results indicated that the absence of functional N-terminal acetyltransferase B exacerbated the effects of hydrogen peroxide-induced cell death. This enhanced susceptibility to oxidative damages highlights the potential for therapeutic interventions that modulate the activity of N-terminal acetyltransferase B to mitigate neuronal loss in diseases characterized by oxidative stress, such as Alzheimer's disease. As such, the study provides promising insights into the complex interplay between acetylation processes and cell survival mechanisms, opening avenues for novel drug targets.
