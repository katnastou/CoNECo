prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: NDC1. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In a recent study delineating the cellular mechanisms underlying nuclear pore complex assembly, the integral role of NDC1 has been further elucidated. Immunofluorescence assays in Saccharomyces cerevisiae revealed that depletion of NDC1 results in aberrant nuclear morphology and impeded nuclear envelope sealing during telophase, indicative of its essential function in nuclear pore complex formation. To elucidate the pathway involved, cells were exposed to a gradient of calcium concentrations, as calcium homeostasis has been known to influence various cellular processes. Notably, at elevated calcium levels, cells deficient in NDC1 exhibited markedly elevated stress responses, as assessed by upregulation of heat shock proteins, suggesting a compensatory mechanism to counteract defective nuclear pore formation. Furthermore, an assay using a GFP-tagged nuclear localization signal demonstrated that the nuclear import efficiency in the absence of NDC1 was significantly reduced, strengthening the hypothesis that NDC1 is indispensable for maintaining nucleocytoplasmic transport fidelity. In the context of human pathology, these findings hold potential implications for diseases associated with nuclear envelope dysfunction, providing a foundation for future therapeutic strategies targeting nuclear pore complex biogenesis.
