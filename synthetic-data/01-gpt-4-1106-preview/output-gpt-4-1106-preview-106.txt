prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: 5HT-3A receptor. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In the recent study conducted by our team, we explored the pharmacological modulation of the 5HT-3A receptor and its consequent impact on nociceptive pathways in Mus musculus models. The 5HT-3A receptor, a ligand-gated ion channel, is implicated in various physiological processes including the modulation of neurotransmitter release and the regulation of gastrointestinal motility. Interestingly, aberrant signaling through the 5HT-3A receptor has been associated with the development of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV). Through the administration of selective antagonists, we observed a notable decrease in visceral pain responses in murine models, suggesting that the 5HT-3A receptor plays a pivotal role in the transmission of nociceptive information. In immunohistochemical analyses, the receptor's expression was particularly prominent in the gastrointestinal tract and dorsal root ganglia, supporting its involvement in both central and peripheral pain mechanisms. These findings provide promising insights into the therapeutic potential of 5HT-3A receptor antagonists in the treatment of CINV and other pain-related disorders, although further clinical trials are necessary to elucidate the safety and efficacy of such treatments in human patients.
