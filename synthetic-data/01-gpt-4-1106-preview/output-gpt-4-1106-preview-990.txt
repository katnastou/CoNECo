prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: cytochrome bc(1). Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In a recent study aimed at elucidating the mechanisms underlying cellular respiration, the role of the cytochrome bc(1) complex in mitochondrial electron transport was further elucidated. This complex plays a pivotal role in the transfer of electrons from ubiquinol to cytochrome c, a process which is integral to the formation of a proton gradient across the inner mitochondrial membrane. Consequently, this gradient is utilized by ATP synthase to generate ATP, the cell's primary energy currency. Dysfunction of the cytochrome bc(1) complex has been implicated in a range of pathologies, including certain myopathies and neurodegenerative disorders. In this investigation, a series of assays using isolated mitochondria from murine models revealed that inhibition of cytochrome bc(1) led to a significant decrease in ATP production, underscoring its vital function. Additionally, the use of specific inhibitors allowed for the probing of the electron transfer pathway, yielding insights into the potential sites of pharmacological intervention. These findings offer a deeper understanding of the biochemical landscape of cellular energy metabolism and propose avenues for therapeutic approaches in diseases associated with mitochondrial dysfunction.
