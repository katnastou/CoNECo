prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: IgG2c. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we sought to elucidate the immunological mechanisms underpinning the robust response observed following vaccination in Mus musculus models. Specifically, the role of IgG2c in mediating the host defense against Influenza A virus was investigated. Utilizing an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, we quantified the concentration of IgG2c in serum samples collected from vaccinated and unvaccinated cohorts at various time points post-inoculation. Our findings demonstrated a statistically significant elevation in IgG2c levels within the vaccinated group, which correlated with a marked reduction in viral titers, as determined by hemagglutination inhibition assay. These results suggest that IgG2c plays a critical role in the neutralization of the virus, acting at key stages of the infection pathway. Further elucidation of this protein complex's interaction with other components of the immune response could pave the way for novel therapeutic strategies aimed at enhancing vaccine efficacy, particularly in immunocompromised patients. The promise of IgG2c-focused treatments may thus represent a significant leap forward in our combat against viral pathogens.
