prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: Mis12. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In the pursuit of elucidating the intricate mechanisms that underpin chromosomal segregation during cell division, recent studies have shed light on the pivotal role played by the Mis12 complex. This protein assembly is integral to the proper function of the kinetochore, a dynamic multiprotein structure that facilitates chromosome attachment to the spindle microtubules. A series of experiments utilizing advanced imaging techniques revealed that the Mis12 complex is crucial for the recruitment of additional kinetochore constituents, thereby maintaining the structural integrity and tension-sensing capabilities of the kinetochore throughout mitosis. Disruption of the Mis12 complex has been correlated with aberrancies in chromosome alignment and segregation, culminating in aneuploidy, a hallmark of various carcinomas. In a mouse model, the perturbation of the Mis12 complex led to pronounced cell cycle arrest and apoptosis, underscoring the complex's significance in the maintenance of genomic stability. These findings suggest that pharmacological targeting of the Mis12 complex might hold therapeutic potential for the treatment of diseases characterized by chromosomal instability. Further research is warranted to unravel the precise biochemical pathways and interaction networks that involve the Mis12 complex, which may pave the way for innovative interventions in the realm of cell division-related disorders.
