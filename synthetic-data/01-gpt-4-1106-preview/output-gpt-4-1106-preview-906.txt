prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: BCDX2. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The recent elucidation of BCDX2 function has significantly advanced our understanding of chromosomal stability mechanisms. This complex participates in a critical pathway for DNA repair, safeguarding the genome against deleterious mutations that can lead to oncogenesis. Through a series of in vitro and in vivo experiments, we have observed that the BCDX2 complex interacts with key cell cycle regulators, ensuring timely repair during the S phase. Moreover, pharmacological inhibition of BCDX2 results in an increased frequency of micronuclei formation, indicative of compromised genomic integrity. In murine models, the absence of BCDX2 correlates with heightened sensitivity to ionizing radiation, further underscoring its role in the DNA damage response. The implications of these findings suggest that therapeutic targeting of BCDX2 could be explored in the context of synthetic lethality, especially within tumors harboring specific repair pathway deficiencies. Future research should also investigate the potential interplay between BCDX2 and epigenetic modifiers, as this may unveil additional layers of complexity in the regulation of gene expression following DNA damage.
