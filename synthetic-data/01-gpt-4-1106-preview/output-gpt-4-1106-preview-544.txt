prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: laminin-15. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The recent elucidation of the role of laminin-15 in the basement membrane's structural integrity and cellular signaling has offered novel insights into the pathophysiology of several connective tissue disorders. Being an integral component of the extracellular matrix, laminin-15 contributes to the assembly and stability of the basement membrane by interacting with cell surface receptors, thus mediating cell adhesion, differentiation, and migration. Impaired laminin-15 function has been implicated in the disruption of tissue architecture, particularly evident in the context of chronic wound healing processes. Animal models deficient in this protein complex have exhibited delayed re-epithelialization, suggesting a crucial involvement of laminin-15 in the orchestration of repair mechanisms. Moreover, the exploration of targeted therapeutic interventions aiming to modulate the activity of laminin-15 could potentially translate into improved clinical outcomes for patients suffering from aforementioned tissue disorders. Investigations into the molecular mechanisms by which laminin-15 modulates cellular behavior could further our understanding of the intricate balance between extracellular matrix components and the dynamic cellular environment in health and disease.
