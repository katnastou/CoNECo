prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: SapABCDF. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In the current study, we aimed to investigate the functional role of the protein complex SapABCDF in bacterial resistance to antimicrobial agents. The presence of SapABCDF in the cellular membrane of Escherichia coli was hypothesized to contribute to the pathogen's ability to evade the deleterious effects of certain antibiotics. To elucidate this, we employed a mutagenesis approach, generating an E. coli strain with a targeted disruption in the genes responsible for the expression of SapABCDF. Comparative analyses of the wild-type and mutant strains under antibiotic stress conditions revealed a marked decrease in the survival rate of the SapABCDF-deficient bacteria when exposed to a range of Î²-lactam antibiotics. These findings suggest an integral role for SapABCDF in the antibiotic resistance mechanism of E. coli. Subsequent assays also showed an accumulation of antibiotic molecules within the periplasmic space of the mutant strains, further supporting the hypothesis that SapABCDF functions in the efflux of toxic compounds. Given the crucial role of bacterial resistance in the clinical management of infectious diseases, understanding the function of complexes such as SapABCDF could be pivotal in the development of more effective therapeutic strategies.
