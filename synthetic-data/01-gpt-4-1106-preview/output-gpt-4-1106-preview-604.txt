prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: 20S proteasome. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: Recent studies have provided insight into the role of the 20S proteasome in the proteolytic pathways associated with neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease. The activity of the 20S proteasome, a multicatalytic proteinase complex, is critical for the turnover of ubiquitin-independent substrates, namely damaged or misfolded proteins. This degradation process is essential for maintaining cellular homeostasis. In the current study, we employed a murine model to examine the effects of induced oxidative stress on the functionality of the 20S proteasome. Our results displayed a significant decline in proteolytic activity concomitant with increased oxidative markers, suggesting a direct inhibitory effect of reactive oxygen species on the 20S proteasome. Furthermore, therapeutic interventions using antioxidants highlight the potential for restoring the proteasome activity, providing a promising avenue for treatment strategies. Collectively, our findings underscore the importance of the 20S proteasome in neuronal cell survival and suggest that maintaining its activity could mitigate the progression of proteinopathies in neurodegenerative diseases.
