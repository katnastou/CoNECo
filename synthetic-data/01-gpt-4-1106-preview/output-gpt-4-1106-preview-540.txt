prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: QFR. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In an effort to elucidate the role of the QFR protein complex in cellular respiration, a controlled in vitro study was conducted. The activity of QFR was quantified under varying concentrations of ubiquinone, a key component in the electron transport chain. The findings suggest that QFR functionality is sensitive to the redox state of its coenzyme substrates, implicating its potential regulatory involvement in oxidative stress conditions. Moreover, in Saccharomyces cerevisiae models subjected to hypoxic stress, the expression levels of QFR correlated with enhanced survival rates, highlighting its possible protective mechanisms against ischemic injury. In mammalian cells, pharmacological modulation of QFR activity influenced ATP synthesis rates, providing insights into novel therapeutic targets for metabolic diseases such as mitochondrial myopathies. Collectively, these data underscore the critical importance of QFR in maintaining cellular energy homeostasis, offering a promising avenue for research into metabolic modulation and disease pathology.
