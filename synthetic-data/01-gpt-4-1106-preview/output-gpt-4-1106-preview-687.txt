prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: FN-TGM2. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: Recent studies have focused on the interaction between the extracellular matrix (ECM) and cellular signaling pathways, with the FN-TGM2 protein complex gaining particular interest due to its role in tissue remodeling and fibrosis. In this context, FN-TGM2 has been implicated in the pathogenesis of chronic kidney disease (CKD), as the complex seems to modulate the ECM, leading to altered mechanical properties of the renal parenchyma. Patients with CKD have shown elevated expression levels of the FN-TGM2 complex, correlating with increased deposition of fibrillar collagens and the progression of renal fibrosis. Notably, pharmacological interventions aiming at disrupting the activity of FN-TGM2 have demonstrated promising results in murine models, with a significant reduction in fibrotic markers and improved renal function. Further investigation into the cellular signaling pathways influenced by FN-TGM2 may uncover additional therapeutic targets. Meanwhile, the pathological significance of FN-TGM2 in ECM dynamics offers a novel perspective on the molecular underpinnings of CKD and highlights the potential for targeting ECM-associated protein complexes in the treatment of fibrotic diseases.
