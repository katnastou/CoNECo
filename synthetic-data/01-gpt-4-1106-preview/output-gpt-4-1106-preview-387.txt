prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: alpha8-beta1 integrin. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: Recent advancements in cellular adhesion studies have shed light on the critical role played by the alpha8-beta1 integrin in tissue repair and fibrosis. Through a series of ex vivo assays and in vivo murine models, researchers have delineated the signaling pathways modulated by this protein complex, revealing its penchant for orchestrating cellular interactions with the extracellular matrix. The investigation primarily focused on the effect of alpha8-beta1 integrin on the differentiation of fibroblasts and its consequential impact on the deposition of collagen in a murine model of lung fibrosis. Notably, the modulation of TGF-beta1 by the aforementioned integrin was found to be pivotal in dictating the fibrogenic milieu within the affected tissue, underpinning its significance in the pathogenesis of fibrotic diseases. Administration of specific pharmacological inhibitors targeting the signaling cascade activated by alpha8-beta1 integrin resulted in an amelioration of fibrotic symptoms within the affected animals. These findings not only advance our understanding of fibrosis but also propose a potential therapeutic avenue involving the selective antagonism of alpha8-beta1 integrin-mediated pathways, offering hope for the development of efficacious treatments for various fibrotic disorders.
