prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: FACT. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In the recent study published by the International Journal of Molecular Sciences, the role of FACT in chromatin remodeling and its subsequent impact on transcriptional regulation has become increasingly evident. The research, conducted on murine models, elucidated that FACT plays a critical role in modulating the accessibility of DNA to transcription factors during cell cycle progression, particularly within the S phase. By employing immunoprecipitation coupled with mass spectrometry, the analysis revealed a distinctive interaction profile of FACT under conditions of oxidative stress, induced by hydrogen peroxide treatment. Furthermore, the study explored the implications of FACT dysregulation in the context of oncogenesis, observing that cells exhibiting aberrant levels of FACT presented with a propensity towards uncontrolled division, a hallmark of tumorigenesis. These findings underscore the potential of FACT as a therapeutic target in diseases such as cancer, where management of chromatin dynamics and transcriptional fidelity are of utmost importance. The research team posits that the modulation of FACT activity could provide a novel avenue for the development of targeted treatment regimens, with the potential for significant clinical impact.
