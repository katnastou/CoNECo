prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: Kinetochore CCAN. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In a recent study, the role of the Kinetochore CCAN in chromosomal stability during cell division has been elucidated further, revealing novel insights into its interaction with mitotic spindle fibers in Homo sapiens. This protein complex has been implicated in ensuring accurate chromosome segregation, a critical process that, when compromised, may lead to aneuploidy and potentially cancer progression. Using advanced cryo-electron microscopy, researchers have observed the Kinetochore CCAN at high resolution, allowing for a more precise understanding of its structural dynamics. Upon treatment with the microtubule-stabilizing agent paclitaxel, a marked increase in the affinity of the Kinetochore CCAN for microtubules was noted, suggesting a potential regulatory mechanism that might be exploited in targeted cancer therapies. Moreover, fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) experiments indicated that during the metaphase-anaphase transition, there are conformational changes within the Kinetochore CCAN, which may be integral for the function of the spindle assembly checkpoint. The data suggest that modulating the function of this complex could provide a new avenue for the development of pharmaceuticals aimed at the treatment of chromosomal instability disorders.
