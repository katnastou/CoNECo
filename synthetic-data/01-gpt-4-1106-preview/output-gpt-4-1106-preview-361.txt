prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: RTC. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we sought to delineate the functional implications of the RTC in cellular response to oxidative stress, a condition implicated in the pathogenesis of several neurodegenerative diseases. Cultured murine neuronal cells were exposed to hydrogen peroxide to induce oxidative stress, followed by assessment of RTC activity. Immunoprecipitation assays confirmed the integrity of the RTC under oxidative conditions, indicating its potential role in cellular defense mechanisms. Subsequent cell viability assays revealed a significant decrease in neuronal survival upon RTC inhibition, supporting the hypothesis that the RTC plays a crucial role in mediating the cellular response to oxidative stress. Further, treatment with the antioxidant N-acetylcysteine ameliorated the detrimental effects observed upon RTC suppression, reinforcing the complex's involvement in redox homeostasis. Collectively, these findings suggest the RTC as a novel target for therapeutic intervention in disorders characterized by oxidative stress.
