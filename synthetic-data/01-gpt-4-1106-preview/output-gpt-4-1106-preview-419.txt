prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: WRC. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In the recent investigation into the molecular underpinnings of cytoskeletal dynamics, emphasis has been placed on delineating the functional role of the WRC in cellular processes. Notably, extensive in vitro studies have established that the WRC is critical for the regulation of actin polymerization, a process essential for various cellular activities including migration, adhesion, and morphogenesis. Using advanced fluorescent microscopy, the present study tracked the localization of the WRC within human epithelial cells under conditions simulating wound-healing scenarios. The results demonstrated a pronounced recruitment of the WRC to the leading edge of migrating cells, concomitant with an increase in intracellular Ca^2+ concentration. Moreover, pharmacological inhibition of Ca^2+ channels resulted in the perturbation of WRC localization, underscoring the importance of Ca^2+ signaling in the functional deployment of the WRC during tissue repair mechanisms. In pathological context, aberrant WRC activity has been correlated with the progression of invasive carcinomas, suggesting a potential therapeutic target for the inhibition of cancer metastasis. Further characterization of the WRC in cellular models of disease states promises to shed light on the intricate network of signaling pathways that govern cell behavior and contribute to the complexity of organismal homeostasis and disease.
