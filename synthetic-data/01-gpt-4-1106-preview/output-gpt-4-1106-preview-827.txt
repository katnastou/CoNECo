prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: ribonuclease H2. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In a recent groundbreaking study, the role of ribonuclease H2 in DNA replication fidelity was elucidated through a series of meticulous in vitro experiments. This protein complex has been implicated in the removal of RNA-DNA hybrid structures, which are known to arise during the replication process. The accumulation of such hybrids can lead to genomic instability, a condition frequently observed in cancer cells. Researchers have demonstrated that when ribonuclease H2 activity is compromised, there is a concomitant increase in replication stress and a heightened susceptibility to mutagenic events. The experiments utilized a human cell line that was genetically engineered to express a catalytically inactive variant of ribonuclease H2. The findings of this study underscore the importance of ribonuclease H2 in maintaining genomic integrity and highlight its potential as a therapeutic target for diseases characterized by genomic instability, such as cancer. Furthermore, by using a combination of fluorescent imaging techniques and next-generation sequencing, the researchers were able to visualize the accumulation of RNA-DNA hybrids and assess the resultant mutation spectra, thereby providing invaluable insight into the mechanisms by which ribonuclease H2 safeguards the cell's genetic material.
