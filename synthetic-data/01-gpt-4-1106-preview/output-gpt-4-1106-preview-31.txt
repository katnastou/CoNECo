prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: GATOR2. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: Recent studies have elucidated critical functions of GATOR2 in the regulation of mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) signaling pathway, which is instrumental in cellular growth and metabolic control. GATOR2 serves as a positive regulator and has been shown to interact with upstream amino acid sensors, thereby modulating the activation state of mTORC1. Disruption of GATOR2 function has been implicated in the perturbation of cellular homeostasis, pinpointing its essential role in maintaining amino acid-induced activation of mTORC1. In murine models, knockdown of GATOR2 led to pronounced phenotypes characteristic of deficient mTORC1 activity, including reduced cell size and decreased synthesis of key biomolecules. Additionally, examination of human cell lines under various stress conditions revealed that GATOR2 is vital for the adaptive reprogramming of metabolic pathways, suggesting potential therapeutic avenues for diseases such as cancer and diabetes where mTORC1 signaling is dysregulated. These findings underscore the importance of GATOR2 in integrating nutritional and environmental cues with the intracellular machinery governing cell growth and metabolism, providing new insights into the complex regulation of mTORC1 and adjacent pathways.
