prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: interleukin-4 receptor. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The activation of the interleukin-4 receptor plays a pivotal role in the modulation of immune responses, particularly in the context of allergic inflammation and Th2 cell differentiation. In this study, we explored the downstream signaling cascade triggered by the interleukin-4 receptor in murine models, focusing on the subsequent transcriptional events that contribute to the pathogenesis of asthma. Following the administration of ovalbumin as an allergen, mice exhibited an increase in the expression of cytokines typically associated with a Th2-skewed immune response. These cytokines were significantly reduced following the administration of a targeted inhibitor against the interleukin-4 receptor, suggesting that the receptor's activation is crucial for the propagation of the allergic response. Furthermore, histological examination of lung tissues revealed a marked decrease in eosinophil infiltration and mucus production in treated subjects, underscoring the therapeutic potential of modulating interleukin-4 receptor activity. Pulmonary function tests also demonstrated improvement in airway hyper-responsiveness, further supporting the notion that the interleukin-4 receptor serves as a critical node in the network of signals driving allergic asthma. Collectively, our results underscore the importance of the interleukin-4 receptor in immune regulation and highlight its utility as a therapeutic target for intervening in immune-mediated diseases.
