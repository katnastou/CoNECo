prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: BRM. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In the current study, we explored the functional role of BRM in the context of colorectal cancer progression. Prior to conducting in vivo analyses, we confirmed the expression of BRM in a panel of human colorectal carcinoma cell lines through western blot assays. Subsequently, we utilized a xenograft mouse model to assess the impact of BRM on tumor growth and metastatic potential. Mice were injected subcutaneously with colorectal carcinoma cells exhibiting either overexpression or knockdown of BRM, and tumor volume was monitored over a period of six weeks. Our results indicated that the mice harboring cells with BRM overexpression exhibited significantly reduced tumor growth compared to the control group. Additionally, histochemical staining of excised tumors revealed a marked decrease in angiogenesis markers in the BRM overexpression group. Tumor tissues were further analyzed for the presence of apoptosis markers, and a pronounced increase in apoptotic cells was observed in the tumors with high levels of BRM. These findings suggest that BRM may play a crucial suppressive role in colorectal cancer progression and offer potential insights into the mechanisms underlying tumor growth and dissemination. Further investigation is warranted to elucidate the signaling pathways through which BRM exerts its antitumor effects and to evaluate its therapeutic potential in colorectal cancer treatment.
