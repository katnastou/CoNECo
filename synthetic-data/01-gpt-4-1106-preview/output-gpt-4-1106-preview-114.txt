prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: CDL2. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The recent elucidation of the role played by the protein complex CDL2 in mammalian cellular mechanisms offers novel insights into the pathology of various neurodegenerative disorders. In this study, we sought to characterize the interaction between CDL2 and specific signaling pathways implicated in the regulation of autophagic processes within neurons. Utilizing murine models, we observed that the presence of CDL2 is essential for the preservation of cellular homeostasis under conditions of oxidative stress, which was induced by administration of hydrogen peroxide. Furthermore, quantitative proteomic analysis revealed that CDL2 is differentially regulated in response to neurotoxic stimuli, compared to non-pathological states. Intriguingly, our investigation also correlated the aberrant expression of CDL2 with an accelerated progression of symptoms in a rat model of Alzheimer's disease, thereby suggesting a potential target for therapeutic intervention. Subsequent in vitro assays demonstrated that the pharmacological inhibition of CDL2 leads to a marked decrease in tau hyperphosphorylation, effectively attenuating one of the key pathological hallmarks of this devastating illness. These results underscore the importance of CDL2 in the maintenance of neuronal health and open new avenues for the development of treatment strategies aimed at modulating its activity in disease contexts.
