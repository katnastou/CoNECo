prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: DBIRD. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In a recent endeavor to comprehend the mechanisms underlying transcriptional regulation in eukaryotic cells, considerable focus has been directed toward characterizing the multifaceted roles of chromatin-associated protein complexes. A pivotal study illuminated the function of the DBIRD complex in the context of chromatin remodeling and RNA polymerase II (Pol II) function. Analysis of chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing (ChIP-seq) and knockdown experiments in model organisms such as Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Homo sapiens revealed a pronounced enrichment of the DBIRD complex at actively transcribed gene loci exhibiting high levels of histone acetylation, a mark associated with chromatin openness and transcriptional activity. Moreover, immunofluorescence labelling and subsequent confocal microscopy analysis showed a notable co-localization of DBIRD with RNA Pol II, suggesting a close operational relationship. Further elucidating the DBIRD complex's role, quantitative proteomics analysis revealed that its presence correlates with transcriptional consistency across a spectrum of stress conditions, including oxidative stress and heat shock. Notably, in vitro transcription assays have demonstrated that the absence of the DBIRD complex leads to a marked decrease in the efficiency and fidelity of transcription elongation. Additionally, the investigation of disease models confirmed an exacerbation of certain phenotypes resembling those observed in neurodegenerative disorders upon the disruption of DBIRD function. Collectively, these findings underscore the importance of the DBIRD complex in maintaining genomic integrity and regulating gene expression, with implications for understanding the molecular underpinnings of transcription-associated diseases.
