prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: IgE immunoglobulin. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In the recent study examining allergic inflammation mechanisms, considerable attention was drawn to the role of IgE immunoglobulin in the pathophysiology of atopic dermatitis. The cascade of immune responses instigated by IgE immunoglobulin binding to its high-affinity receptors on mast cells was scrutinized. Results indicated an augmented release of histamine and other pro-inflammatory mediators upon allergen exposure, which correlated with increased erythema and pruritus. Tissue samples from murine models revealed a marked upregulation of IgE immunoglobulin in individuals presenting with the phenotypic manifestations of the disease, compared to the control group. Furthermore, therapeutic interventions aimed at neutralizing IgE immunoglobulin demonstrated a significant mitigation of the inflammatory symptoms, emphasizing the potential of targeted treatments in allergic disorders. The study's findings underscore the critical involvement of IgE immunoglobulin in allergic disease pathogenesis and pave the way for exploring innovative therapeutic avenues concentrating on this protein complex.
