prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: SWI-SNF. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In a recent study, the involvement of the SWI-SNF complex in the regulation of chromatin architecture has been further elucidated, providing insights into its role in gene expression modulation. Chromatin remodeling, a critical process in eukaryotic transcriptional regulation, is mediated by the activity of the SWI-SNF complex, which utilizes the energy derived from ATP hydrolysis to reposition nucleosomes. This alteration in chromatin structure facilitates the accessibility of transcription factors and RNA polymerase to specific genomic loci. Experiments employing chromatin immunoprecipitation coupled with high-throughput sequencing (ChIP-seq) revealed that the SWI-SNF complex preferentially binds to enhancer and promoter regions, demonstrating a targeted approach in its remodeling activity. Notably, perturbations in the function of SWI-SNF have been linked to the pathogenesis of several cancers, where aberrant gene expression patterns are often observed. The results underline the therapeutic potential for targeting the SWI-SNF complex in cancer treatment, indicating that small molecule inhibitors could selectively alter malignant cellular transcription pathways. Further in vivo models will be crucial to understanding the complex regulatory networks influenced by the SWI-SNF complex and developing effective intervention strategies for SWI-SNF related pathologies.
