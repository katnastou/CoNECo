prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: MCCC. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In a recent investigation aimed at delineating the metabolic pathways implicated in inherited metabolic disorders, the functionality of the mitochondrial protein complex MCCC has been placed under scrupulous examination. This exploration was precipitated by the observation of perturbed leucine catabolism in a cohort of patients diagnosed with organic acidemias. Mitochondrial assays revealed that disruptions in the enzymatic activity of MCCC led to an accumulation of specific metabolites, namely 3-methylcrotonyl-CoA and 3-hydroxyisovaleric acid, which are diagnostic markers for the associated metabolic condition. Subsequent in vitro experimentation utilizing cultured human fibroblasts from affected individuals compared to those from healthy controls provided insights into the differential regulation of MCCC under pathological versus normal physiological conditions. The therapeutic potential of vitamin derivatives was also assessed, revealing that supplementation of certain cofactors significantly ameliorated the metabolic crisis induced by MCCC dysfunction. Moreover, the study extended to a murine model, where the phenotypic consequences of MCCC impairment were observable through a series of developmental assays. Collectively, these findings underscore the critical role of MCCC in maintaining metabolic homeostasis and propose novel avenues for clinical intervention in the management of inborn errors of metabolism.
