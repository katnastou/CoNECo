prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: GABA transaminase. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In a seminal investigation aimed at expounding the pathophysiological underpinnings of epilepsy, researchers have scrutinized the role of GABA transaminase in the catabolic breakdown of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) within the central nervous system. The study, employing a cohort of murine models, demonstrated that a marked increase in enzymatic activity of GABA transaminase correlated with a pronounced reduction in GABA concentrations, thus implicating this protein complex in the modulation of inhibitory neurotransmission. Pharmacological inhibition of GABA transaminase was observed to ameliorate seizure frequency, underpinning the therapeutic potential of targeting this enzyme in the management of epilepsy. Concurrently, the exploration of metabolic by-products revealed an accumulation of glutamate, suggesting a dynamic interplay between excitatory and inhibitory metabolites. These findings elucidate a critical aspect of the biochemical cascade implicated in seizure disorders and pave the way for the development of novel interventions focused on the equilibrium of neurotransmitter systems.
