prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: HDAC3. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In the pursuit of elucidating the molecular mechanisms underpinning neurodegenerative diseases, recent investigations have shone a spotlight on the role of HDAC3 in modulating gene expression patterns that are critical for neuronal health and function. A study employing mammalian cell models demonstrated that pharmacological inhibition of HDAC3 led to the upregulation of genes associated with synaptic plasticity and neuroprotection, suggesting a potential repressive role for this protein complex in the neurodegenerative disease context. Furthermore, in an Alzheimer's disease mouse model, administration of a selective HDAC3 inhibitor ameliorated memory deficits and reduced amyloid-beta plaque burden, providing compelling in vivo evidence supporting the therapeutic potential of targeting HDAC3 in neurodegenerative disorders. These findings underscore the integral function of HDAC3 in the orchestration of transcriptional networks pertinent to neuronal survival and pave the way for future investigations into HDAC3 as a novel drug target for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases.
