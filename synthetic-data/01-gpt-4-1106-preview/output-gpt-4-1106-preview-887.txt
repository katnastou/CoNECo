prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: IL-4 receptor. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In the recent groundbreaking study, the role of the IL-4 receptor in modulating immune responses has been further elucidated, providing insightful advances into its therapeutic potential. Mice models deficient in this crucial receptor presented with a marked decrease in T helper 2 (Th2) cell-mediated cytokine production, emphasizing the IL-4 receptor's pivotal function in the immune system's ability to combat specific classes of pathogens. Furthermore, an analysis of samples obtained from patients with atopic dermatitis revealed an upregulation of IL-4 receptor expression, corroborating the hypothesis that this receptor plays a critical role in allergic inflammatory responses. The study utilized an array of inhibitors to selectively target the signaling pathways initiated by the IL-4 receptor engagement, which led to a notable attenuation of allergic reactions in murine models. These findings may pave the way for novel strategies in the development of immunotherapies, potentially leveraging the modulation of the IL-4 receptor to treat a spectrum of inflammatory and atopic diseases, thereby offering a promising horizon in personalized medicine.
