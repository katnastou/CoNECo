prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: WAVE. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In recent years, the WAVE protein complex has garnered significant attention in the field of cellular biology due to its critical role in mediating actin cytoskeletal dynamics. A study published in the latest issue of the Journal of Biomedical Research provided new insights into the regulatory mechanisms governing the activity of the WAVE complex. Through a series of experiments involving mammalian cell lines, the researchers elucidated how intracellular signaling pathways modulate the function of the complex in response to various stimuli. The findings revealed that the presence of specific phosphorylation events can enhance the activity of the WAVE complex, proposing a novel link between cellular signaling and cytoskeletal reorganization. Furthermore, in disease models of cancer, altered regulation of the WAVE complex was observed, signifying a potential association between its dysregulation and tumorigenic processes. These results offer promising avenues for therapeutic interventions targeting the WAVE complex in pathological conditions characterized by aberrant cell motility and invasiveness.
