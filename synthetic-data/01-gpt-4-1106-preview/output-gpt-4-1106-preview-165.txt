prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: polycystin. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: Recent advancements in elucidating the molecular underpinnings of autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) have highlighted the imperative role of the polycystin protein complex in cellular processes. The present study sought to explore the downstream effects of polycystin complex perturbation on intracellular calcium signaling pathways. Using a murine model, kidney tissues were subjected to a series of assays to quantify concentrations of calcium, as well as cyclic AMP, which has been previously implicated in the pathogenesis of ADPKD. Upon analyzing the results, it became evident that disruption of the polycystin complex led to aberrant calcium influx, thereby potentially unravelling a cascade of cytotoxic events. These perturbations correlated with an increase in cellular proliferation and cyst formation, consistent with the disease phenotype observed in clinical settings. Furthermore, the application of a selective calcium ionophore revealed partial restoration of calcium homeostasis, suggesting a possible therapeutic intervention point. This study underscores the critical nature of polycystin in maintaining renal cellular architecture and function, providing invaluable insights into the pathophysiology of ADPKD and paving the way for future investigations targeting the polycystin complex for therapeutic gain.
