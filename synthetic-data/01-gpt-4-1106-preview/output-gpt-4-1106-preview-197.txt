prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: ESCRT I. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: Recent studies have elucidated the pivotal role of ESCRT I in mediating the endosomal sorting of ubiquitinated membrane proteins, a critical process for cellular homeostasis. Dysfunction of this protein complex is associated with the misregulation of receptor downregulation, implicating it in pathologies such as neurodegenerative diseases and cancers. In our latest research, we investigated the interaction between ESCRT I and the lipid phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate found within endosomal membranes, aiming to decipher the mechanistic underpinnings of membrane deformation and vesicle formation. Utilizing Saccharomyces cerevisiae as a model organism, we observed that the presence of ESCRT I was essential for the maintenance of cellular sorting pathways, particularly under stress conditions induced by oxidative agents like hydrogen peroxide. Our findings provide novel insights into the therapeutic potential of modulating ESCRT I activity, suggesting a new avenue for the development of drugs targeting complex cellular pathways affected in an array of diseases.
