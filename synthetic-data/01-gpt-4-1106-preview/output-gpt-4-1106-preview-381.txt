prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: VLA-5. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: Recent studies have indicated that VLA-5 plays a pivotal role in the modulation of cellular adhesion in response to extracellular matrix proteins, particularly during the inflammatory response. This integrin, predominantly expressed on the surface of leukocytes, has been implicated in the pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis. Patients with this autoimmune disorder have demonstrated an upregulation of VLA-5, which correlates with increased infiltration of inflammatory cells into the synovial fluid. In vitro assays have revealed that the interaction between VLA-5 and fibronectin is crucial for the transendothelial migration of these cells. Additionally, pharmacological inhibition of VLA-5 has led to a significant reduction in leukocyte adhesion and subsequent migration, pointing to the therapeutic potential of targeting this protein complex in inflammatory diseases. Further investigation into the signaling pathways downstream of VLA-5 activation has begun to elucidate the complex network of intracellular events that facilitate these critical cellular functions. Understanding these mechanisms may lead to the development of novel anti-inflammatory agents, which could offer relief to patients suffering from chronic inflammatory conditions. In light of these findings, VLA-5 stands out as a promising target for modulating immune cell behavior, with implications that extend beyond rheumatoid arthritis to a wider spectrum of inflammatory diseases.
