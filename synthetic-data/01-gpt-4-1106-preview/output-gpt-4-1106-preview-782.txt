prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: NLRC3 inflammasome. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The role of the NLRC3 inflammasome in modulating inflammatory responses has garnered increasing attention in the field of immunology. Recent studies have elucidated that upon activation by specific pathogenic stimuli, the NLRC3 inflammasome undergoes a conformational change, which is imperative for its oligomerization and subsequent function. This intricate process ultimately leads to the cleavage and activation of pivotal inflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin-1β (IL-1β), signifying the complex's essential role in innate immunity. Moreover, investigations utilizing murine models have demonstrated that dysregulation of the NLRC3 inflammasome is correlated with exacerbated symptoms in autoimmune diseases, suggesting that this complex may hold potential as a therapeutic target. Pharmacological agents designed to modulate the activity of the NLRC3 inflammasome could, therefore, provide a novel avenue for the treatment of inflammatory disorders. Additionally, given the ubiquitous nature of cytokine involvement in various physiological and pathological processes, further research on the regulatory mechanisms of this protein complex may shed light on its functions beyond the immune system, highlighting its potential implications in broader biological contexts.
