prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: ThiBPQ. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In an extensive investigation of the mechanisms underlying thiamine transportation in bacterial cell membranes, the protein complex ThiBPQ has emerged as a critical component within this biological process. The current study utilized a range of biochemical assays to elucidate the function of ThiBPQ within the cellular milieu of *Escherichia coli*. Initial affinity chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry analyses revealed a high specificity of ThiBPQ for thiamine, as opposed to other closely related thiazole compounds. Subsequent in vivo fluorescence measurements demonstrated the efficiency of thiamine uptake in cells expressing ThiBPQ, underlining the importance of this protein complex in maintaining thiamine homeostasis. Intriguingly, when bacterial cultures were subjected to thiamine deprivation, the expression levels of ThiBPQ increased significantly, suggesting a regulated response facilitating the survival of the bacterium under nutrient stress conditions. Moreover, the pathophysiological relevance of this mechanism was highlighted by infection models in which hosts deficient in thiamine exhibited increased susceptibility to bacterial proliferation when the ThiBPQ system was functionally active. Collectively, these findings advance our understanding of thiamine transport pathways and suggest that ThiBPQ could serve as a potential target for the development of novel antimicrobial agents aimed at disrupting thiamine acquisition in pathogenic bacteria.
