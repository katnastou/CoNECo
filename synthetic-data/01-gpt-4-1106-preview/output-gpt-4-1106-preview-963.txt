prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: U12-type prespliceosome. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The assembly of the U12-type prespliceosome is a crucial stage in the minor spliceosome pathway, which is responsible for the removal of a subset of non-canonical introns from eukaryotic pre-mRNAs. Recent studies have elucidated that this multiprotein complex engages the pre-mRNA early during spliceosome assembly, recognizing the distinctive U12-type intronic boundary sequences. Intriguingly, aberrations in U12-type prespliceosome function have been implicated in a spectrum of human diseases, highlighting the complex's significance beyond mere splicing mechanics. In our investigation, we utilized human-derived cell lines to probe the temporal dynamics of the U12-type prespliceosome in the context of oxidative stress, elicited by exposure to hydrogen peroxide. Our findings suggest that the oxidative environment imposes a significant challenge on the assembly of the U12-type prespliceosome, with potential implications for the modulation of alternative splicing events under conditions of cellular stress. These observations warrant further exploration into the intricacies of the U12-type prespliceosome's regulation, potentially unveiling novel therapeutic avenues for diseases associated with splicing dysregulation.
