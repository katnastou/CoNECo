prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: AREX. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In the recent study published in the Journal of Molecular Biomedicine, researchers have elucidated the novel role of the AREX protein complex in the regulation of apoptosis in mammalian cells. The complex appears to be a pivotal determinant in the cellular response to oxidative stressâ€”a condition characteristically prevalent in neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's. Utilizing a combination of CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing and fluorescent tagging techniques, the team was able to observe the localization and interaction dynamics of AREX under varying experimental conditions. The results indicated that AREX plays a crucial role in the modulation of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels, wherein its activity was inversely correlated with the susceptibility of cells to undergo programmed cell death. Furthermore, pharmacological inhibition of AREX resulted in an increased resistance to apoptosis in cell culture models when exposed to cytotoxic agents, suggesting potential therapeutic implications for pathologies characterized by aberrant cell death. Thus, the research opens new avenues for the development of drugs targeting the AREX protein complex, with the aim of ameliorating oxidative stress-related cellular damage and reducing the progression of diseases that stem from such molecular dysfunction.
