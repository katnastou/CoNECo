prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: MCM core. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In recent years, the mechanistic understanding of DNA replication has significantly advanced with the elucidation of the role played by the MCM core within the replication fork. The MCM core, an essential helicase complex, is implicated in unwinding double-stranded DNA, thereby allowing replication to proceed in a bi-directional manner. In our latest study, we investigated the interaction of the MCM core with nucleotide analogs to discern the impact on replication fidelity. Notably, our experiments revealed a marked reduction in replication speed in the presence of certain analogs, suggesting a potential regulatory mechanism for the MCM core's helicase activity. These findings provide invaluable insight into the replication machinery's susceptibility to chemical perturbations and could inform the development of novel therapeutic agents targeting replication processes in oncogenic cells. Furthermore, cell-line based assays indicated that replication stress, induced by the disruption of the MCM core's activity, triggered a cascade of events leading to cell cycle arrest, highlighting its critical role in maintaining genomic stability. Given the ubiquity and conservation of the MCM core across eukaryotic organisms, these results underscore the fundamental nature of its function and its potential as a therapeutic target in disease states characterized by abnormal replication dynamics.
