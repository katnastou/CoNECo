prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: interleukin-3 receptor. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In a recent study, the interaction between the interleukin-3 receptor and various cytokines was the subject of extensive investigation to determine its role in hematopoietic cell regulation. The interleukin-3 receptor, a transmembrane protein complex, has long been recognized for its capacity to mediate vital signaling pathways within the immune system, particularly those involving proliferation and differentiation of progenitor cells. Through a series of in vitro assays and murine models, the research elucidated how the binding affinity of this receptor to its ligand affects downstream cellular activities, potentially illuminating novel therapeutic avenues for the treatment of hematological malignancies such as acute myeloid leukemia. Employing fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS), researchers were able to quantify the expression levels of the interleukin-3 receptor on various cell populations and correlate these findings with the cellular response to inflammatory stimuli. Additionally, the investigation incorporated mass spectrometry to identify post-translational modifications that might regulate the activity of this receptor. Data analysis revealed a notable expansion in cell populations expressing the interleukin-3 receptor following exposure to an inflammatory environment, suggesting that modulation of this receptor's signaling could be integral in controlling disease progression. The study provided evidence that therapeutic strategies targeting the interleukin-3 receptor could have profound implications for the modulation of immune responses in patients, thereby contributing to the development of precise and personalized medical interventions.
