prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: HAUS. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: Recent studies have elucidated the pivotal role of the HAUS complex in the cellular mechanisms underlying mitotic spindle assembly, suggesting renewed perspectives in the targeting of proliferative diseases. The interactions of HAUS with microtubules have underscored its importance in ensuring accurate chromosome segregation, a process often disrupted in various cancer phenotypes. Affinity chromatography followed by mass spectrometry has revealed that HAUS complex stability is modulated by ATP levels, implicating cellular energy status in spindle dynamics. Furthermore, in vitro assays using Xenopus egg extracts implicated the complex in microtubule nucleation and organization, emphasizing its potential as a therapeutic target. Disruption of HAUS function through small molecule inhibitors caused aberrant mitotic events, leading to apoptosis in cancer cell lines. This finding underpins a novel therapeutic strategy for intervention in disorders characterized by uncontrolled cell division. Continued investigation into the mechanistic pathways mediated by HAUS will undoubtedly enhance the understanding of mitosis and the development of targeted cancer treatments.
