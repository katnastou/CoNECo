prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: elongin. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: Investigation into the role of elongin within the cellular milieu has provided insights into its critical function in transcriptional regulation. In a recent study focusing on the dynamic interactions between proteins and signaling pathways, elongin was found to mediate the assembly of multi-protein complexes, thus exerting influence over gene expression patterns. This regulatory capacity of elongin suggests a broader impact on cellular homeostasis and has implications for understanding the pathogenesis of various diseases. For instance, aberrant activity of elongin has been associated with a propensity towards oncogenesis in certain mammalian cells, highlighting the complex's potential as a target for therapeutic intervention. During the course of this study, assays involving the administration of specific inhibitors and subsequent analysis of cellular response revealed a dose-dependent modulation of elongin's activity. Moreover, in vivo experiments utilizing a murine model have delineated the physiological repercussions of altered elongin function, offering a glimpse into the complex's role in organismal development and disease progression. The findings underscore the importance of elongin in maintaining genomic stability and confirm the necessity of tightly regulated protein-protein interactions in the preservation of cellular integrity.
