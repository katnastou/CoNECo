prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: 5-HT3AR. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we investigate the modulation of 5-HT3AR by various pharmacological agents and its subsequent effect on the manifestation of anxiety behaviors in murine models. The 5-HT3AR, a ligand-gated ion channel, has been implicated in the regulation of neurotransmitter release across several neural pathways. Previous research has highlighted its prominence in the gastrointestinal tract and the central nervous system, suggesting a multifaceted role in physiological processes. Here, we used selective antagonists and agonists to delineate the 5-HT3AR's function in anxiety circuits. Our in vivo experiments were conducted on Mus musculus specimens that were genetically predisposed to heightened anxiety-like behavior. Behavioral assays, including the elevated plus maze and open field tests, were coupled with electrophysiological measurements to assess the impact of 5-HT3AR modulation on neural activity within the amygdala. The data indicate that targeted modulation of 5-HT3AR can significantly alter the behavioral responses associated with anxiety, potentially paving the way for novel therapeutic interventions in anxiety disorders. Moreover, the administration of specific 5-HT3AR antagonists led to a measurable decrease in corticosterone levels, offering evidence for the complex's involvement in the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis's stress response. This linkage between the 5-HT3AR function and anxiety-related behaviors at both molecular and systemic levels offers new insights into the neurobiological underpinnings of anxiety disorders.
