prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: PeBoW. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: Recent studies have elucidated the pivotal role of the PeBoW complex in ribosome biogenesis, a fundamental cellular process critical for protein synthesis across various taxa, including eukaryotic organisms. This research has illuminated the intricacies of the complex assembly and function within the nucleolus, where it interacts with precursor ribosomal RNA (pre-rRNA) to facilitate proper maturation and assembly of the 60S ribosomal subunit. Disruptions in the function of PeBoW have been correlated with perturbed cellular homeostasis and are implicated in the pathology of ribosomopathies, a subset of disorders characterized by dysfunctional ribosome biogenesis. The intricate involvement of the PeBoW complex with specific nucleotides of pre-rRNA underscores its importance as a potential target for therapeutic intervention. Chemical inhibitors that modulate the activity of PeBoW hold promise for the treatment of diseases associated with aberrant protein synthesis, and ongoing research is directed towards understanding the complex mechanisms by which PeBoW contributes to cellular growth and proliferation, with an emphasis on cancer and developmental disorders where rates of protein synthesis are notably altered.
