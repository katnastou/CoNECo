prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: IL-15-receptor. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The multifunctional cytokine IL-15 plays a pivotal role in the regulation of the immune system, which is mediated through its interaction with the IL-15-receptor complex. Recent studies have elucidated the mechanism by which this receptor transduces signals into the cell, resulting in the activation of natural killer (NK) cells and the enhanced proliferation of CD8+ T cells. In the context of infection, the IL-15-receptor has been shown to be instrumental in the clearance of intracellular pathogens, conferring a significant survival advantage to the host organism. Conversely, dysregulation of IL-15-receptor signaling has been implicated in the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases, where aberrant activation of immune cells leads to tissue damage. Therapeutic strategies aimed at modulating the IL-15-receptor pathway have demonstrated efficacy in preclinical models of autoimmune disorders, highlighting the complex's potential as a drug target. Additionally, the impact of this receptor on the differentiation of memory T cells opens intriguing possibilities for enhancing vaccine efficacy, indicating that research into the IL-15-receptor provides significant insights relevant to both infectious diseases and immune disorders.
