prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: scADA. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In a recent multi-disciplinary study, the activity of the scADA protein complex was observed in the context of epigenetic regulation. The investigation, relying on advanced chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by high-throughput sequencing (ChIP-seq), elucidated the role of scADA in histone acetylation patterns across various cell lines. Particularly, when human fibroblasts were subjected to oxidative stress induced by hydrogen peroxide, a notable increase in scADA recruitment to promoter regions of stress response genes was detected. This recruitment was concomitant with an elevation in acetylation marks on histone H3, suggesting a potential regulatory function of scADA in the transcriptional activation of genes involved in the cellular defense against oxidative damage. Subsequent functional assays revealed that the disturbance of scADA activity led to a substantial decrease in cell viability under stress conditions, implicating a protective role that could be relevant in disease states characterized by aberrant oxidative stress, such as neurodegenerative disorders. These findings provide a foundation for future research into the therapeutic targeting of scADA to bolster cellular resilience in such pathologies.
