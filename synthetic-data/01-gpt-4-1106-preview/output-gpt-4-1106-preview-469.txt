prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: cullin-RING ligase 4A. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In the recent study investigating the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway, cullin-RING ligase 4A has emerged as a critical regulator of protein homeostasis within eukaryotic cells. Our research involved elucidating the role of cullin-RING ligase 4A in the context of cellular stress responses. Employing both in vitro and in vivo models, we demonstrated that the activity of cullin-RING ligase 4A is markedly increased under oxidative stress conditions, induced by the administration of hydrogen peroxide. In examining disease models, it was observed that cells derived from patients with neurodegenerative disorders exhibited altered levels of cullin-RING ligase 4A, suggesting a potential connection between this complex and disease pathogenesis. Therapeutic modulation of cullin-RING ligase 4A activity using small molecules was found to attenuate the deleterious effects of protein aggregation, hinting at a promising new avenue for the development of drugs targeting proteinopathies. This evidence collectively underscores the importance of cullin-RING ligase 4A in maintaining cellular proteostasis and offers a novel perspective on how modulating its activity could contribute to the understanding and treatment of related diseases.
