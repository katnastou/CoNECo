prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: GT-AG spliceosome. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In the current study, we aimed to elucidate the role of the GT-AG spliceosome in the regulation of mRNA splicing within human embryonic kidney cells under oxidative stress conditions. Exposure to hydrogen peroxide was employed to induce oxidative stress, thereby simulating an environment conducive to the dysregulation of cellular processes. The GT-AG spliceosome, a crucial assembly in the post-transcriptional modification of pre-mRNA, was isolated and its activity profiled across various time points post-oxidant exposure. Comprehensive quantification of mRNA splicing variants demonstrated a temporal shift in the spliceosome's activity, suggesting a potential adaptive response to maintain cellular integrity. As aberrant splicing has been implicated in a myriad of diseases, including several neurodegenerative disorders and cancers, understanding the dynamics of the GT-AG spliceosome under stress conditions may provide vital insights into potential therapeutic targets. Importantly, the preservation of spliceosome function appears integral to maintaining homeostasis and thus, offers a compelling avenue for future investigation into the molecular underpinnings of disease pathogenesis.
