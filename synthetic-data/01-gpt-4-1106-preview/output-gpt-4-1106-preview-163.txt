prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: Swm. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we report on the functional characterization of the Swm protein complex and its putative role in neurodegenerative disease pathology. The proteomic analysis revealed an elevated presence of the Swm complex in the cerebral cortex of murine models exhibiting Alzheimer's disease phenotypes when compared to their non-transgenic counterparts. To investigate the biochemical implications of Swm overexpression, we conducted an array of assays, including cell viability, tau phosphorylation, and synaptic plasticity measurements. Interestingly, in vitro experiments with primary neuronal cultures exposed to amyloid-beta (Aβ) demonstrated that the modulation of Swm complex levels correlates with a protective effect against Aβ-induced cytotoxicity. Further, the electrophysiological quantification of long-term potentiation indicated a possible involvement of Swm in synaptic function, with potential implications for memory and learning processes in Alzheimer's disease. These findings suggest a critical role for the Swm complex in the cellular pathways associated with neurodegeneration, warranting additional investigation into its therapeutic potential and underlying mechanisms of action within the central nervous system.
