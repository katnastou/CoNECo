prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: PP2A. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we investigated the regulatory role of PP2A in oncogenic signal transduction pathways. PP2A, a serine/threonine phosphatase, has been implicated in the modulation of cell growth and the maintenance of genomic stability. It has been established that this protein complex dephosphorylates key substrates involved in the cell cycle, thereby exerting a tumor-suppressive function. Dysregulation of PP2A activity has been observed in a variety of cancers, suggesting that restoration of its function could represent a novel therapeutic strategy. To test this hypothesis, human carcinoma cells were treated with forskolin to enhance cAMP levels, an intervention that is known to activate PP2A. The treatment resulted in a notable reduction in proliferation, evidenced by a decrease in Ki-67 staining. These findings indicate that activating PP2A disrupts proliferative signaling, suggesting a potential pathway for therapeutic intervention. Further in vivo studies in murine models are warranted to assess the effects of PP2A activation on tumor growth and metastasis, which may elucidate the protein complex's role as a critical regulator of oncogenesis.
