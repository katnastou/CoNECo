prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: FAR. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In a recent groundbreaking study, the functional dynamics of the Fibroblast Activation Regulator (FAR) complex in pathological tissue remodeling have been thoroughly investigated. This analysis has revealed that the presence of FAR is highly upregulated in fibroblasts undergoing activation in response to pro-fibrotic stimuli within the microenvironment of several fibrotic diseases, including idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and systemic sclerosis. Intriguingly, treatment with specific small molecule inhibitors demonstrated a robust decrease in the activation markers, implicating the pivotal role of FAR in the pathology of these diseases. Furthermore, quantitative proteomics analyses have unearthed potential phosphorylation sites on FAR, which suggests a sophisticated layer of post-translational modification that may modulate its activity during fibroblast activation. These findings not only advance our understanding of the molecular mechanisms governing fibrosis but also herald the validation of FAR as a novel therapeutic target. Future in vivo studies in murine models and subsequent clinical trials will be crucial to evaluate the efficacy of targeting FAR in the amelioration of fibrotic diseases.
