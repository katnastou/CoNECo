prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: HCab. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In a recent study, the intracellular signaling cascade implicated in the pathogenesis of colorectal cancer has been elucidated, highlighting the pivotal role of the HCab protein complex. The research, conducted on murine models, used a combination of immunohistochemistry and mass spectrometry to determine the localization and functional partners of HCab. The findings showed that upon stimulation by pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin-6, HCab undergoes a conformational change that facilitates its interaction with downstream effectors involved in cell proliferation. This change in HCab conformation was observed to potentiate the JAK/STAT signaling pathway, which is known for its role in promoting oncogenic transformations. Treatment with a specific inhibitor of HCab resulted in reduced tumor growth, suggesting that HCab may serve as a potential therapeutic target. The expression level of HCab in human colorectal cancer biopsy samples also correlated with disease severity, proposing that HCab could be a prognostic biomarker for this malignancy. These novel insights into the molecular mechanisms of colorectal cancer provide a foundation for future drug development, aiming to disrupt the aberrant signaling mediated by HCab.
