prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: laminin-121. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we explored the therapeutic potential of laminin-121 in the context of cutaneous wound healing. Laminin-121, a critical component of the extracellular matrix (ECM), is known to play a pivotal role in the regulation of cellular behaviors, including adhesion, proliferation, and migration. Utilizing a murine model, we administered a purified preparation of laminin-121 topically on full-thickness excisional wounds and assessed the rate of re-epithelialization over a period of 14 days. Histological analysis demonstrated that treatment with laminin-121 significantly accelerated wound closure compared to the control group. Moreover, immunohistochemistry revealed enhanced reconstitution of the dermal-epidermal junction, indicating improved tissue architecture. These findings suggest that laminin-121 may modulate the healing process through interactions with keratinocytes and fibroblasts, highlighting its potential as a bioactive scaffold or as part of a complex wound dressing material. By elucidating the mechanisms through which laminin-121 exerts its effects, we aim to advance the development of innovative therapies for patients suffering from chronic wounds, a prevalent complication often observed in individuals with diabetes mellitus.
