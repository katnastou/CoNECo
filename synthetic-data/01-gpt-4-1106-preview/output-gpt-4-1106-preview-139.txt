prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: 90S preribosome. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In a recent study, significant advancements have been made in understanding the assembly process of ribosomal subunits within the eukaryotic cell nucleus. Researchers have isolated and characterized the early nucleolar structure identified as the 90S preribosome, a pivotal precursor in the maturation of the small ribosomal subunit. Fluorescent tagging and cryo-electron microscopy revealed that the 90S preribosome undergoes a series of highly regulated conformational transitions driven by ATP-dependent factors during its biogenesis. In parallel, mass spectrometry analyses have enumerated the intricate inventory of non-ribosomal proteins transiently associated with the 90S preribosome, shedding light on their potential regulatory roles in ribosome assembly. Additionally, comparative studies in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and mammalian cells suggest that the fundamental features of the 90S preribosome are conserved across species. The implications of these discoveries are far-reaching, as disruptions in the formation of the 90S preribosome have been implicated in disorders of ribosomopathy, including Diamond-Blackfan Anemia and Shwachman-Diamond Syndrome, highlighting the clinical significance of this complex in cellular physiology and pathology. Further investigation into the dynamics of the 90S preribosome may reveal novel therapeutic targets for these and related diseases.
