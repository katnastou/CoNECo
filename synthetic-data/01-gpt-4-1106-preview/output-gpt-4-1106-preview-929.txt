prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: sgaTBA. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The recently characterized protein complex sgaTBA has become a focal point in the study of cellular autophagy regulation. In a comprehensive study utilizing a murine model, the role of sgaTBA was examined in the context of neurodegenerative diseases, specifically its impact on proteostasis mechanisms within neuronal populations. The experimental paradigm included both in vitro and in vivo approaches, with primary neuron cultures as well as whole-brain analyses conducted post mortem. Application of advanced proteomic techniques revealed that the presence of sgaTBA correlates with a marked decrease in the aggregation of pathogenic proteins, such as beta-amyloid and tau, both of which are implicated in Alzheimer's disease pathology. Intriguingly, the expression of sgaTBA was found to be modulated by cellular stress response pathways, pointing to a potential feedback mechanism that protects cells during oxidative stress. This protective effect was further illustrated through pharmacological modulation using specific kinase inhibitors, which led to altered sgaTBA activity and subsequent impact on autophagosome formation. These findings indicate that sgaTBA is an integral part of the cellular machinery that maintains protein homeostasis and suggest a promising avenue for therapeutic intervention in the context of neuroprotection.
