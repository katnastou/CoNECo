prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: TGF-betal. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In a recent study, we examined the impact of TGF-betal on fibroblast proliferation in the context of myocardial infarction repair mechanisms. Post-infarction cardiac remodeling is a critical process, influenced by various signaling pathways that orchestrate tissue regeneration and scar formation. The role of TGF-betal, a multifunctional cytokine, was investigated using murine models subjected to induced myocardial infarction. Following injury, the expression of TGF-betal was monitored qualitatively through immunohistochemistry and quantitatively via enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). TGF-betal levels peaked at day 7 and declined by day 14 post-infarction. In vitro, isolated cardiac fibroblasts were treated with exogenous TGF-betal, resulting in enhanced proliferation and collagen synthesis, suggesting its key regulatory role in the production of extracellular matrix components. Furthermore, in vivo administration of TGF-betal modulators correlated with altered fibroblast activity and myocardial stiffness, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target. These findings pave the way for more detailed examinations of TGF-betal-mediated pathways, which could lead to innovative interventions in post-infarction cardiac recovery and fibrosis attenuation.
