prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: IFT complex A. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we examined the role of IFT complex A in the regulation of ciliary assembly and function within murine renal epithelial cells. To dissect the mechanistic pathways influenced by the IFT complex A, we employed a combination of fluorescence microscopy and biochemical assays to assess ciliary protein trafficking in wild-type and knockout cell models. Upon treatment with chloroquine, an autophagy inhibitor, the dynamics of ciliary maintenance were scrutinized. Interestingly, our observations suggest that IFT complex A is crucial for the efficient delivery of molecular cargo essential for ciliary stability and homeostasis. Furthermore, in the context of kidney physiology, altered function of IFT complex A is correlated with the manifestation of symptoms akin to those observed in patients suffering from polycystic kidney disease, thus implying a potential therapeutic target for intervention. These findings not only illuminate the intricate biological processes governing ciliary architecture but also raise important implications for the development of treatments for ciliary-associated disorders.
