prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: VBC. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In a recent study aiming to elucidate the mechanisms behind ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis, the role of the VBC complex has been brought to light. This multiprotein complex is pivotal in targeting specific substrates for degradation at the proteasome, a process imperative for cellular homeostasis. Dysfunction within this pathway has been implicated in the pathogenesis of various diseases, including certain malignancies and neurodegenerative disorders. Investigations utilizing knockout mouse models revealed that disruption of the VBC complex leads to dysregulation in the cell cycle, ultimately resulting in widespread cellular apoptosis. Furthermore, biochemical assays have demonstrated the affinity of the VBC complex for polyubiquitinated substrates, suggesting a highly selective mechanism of action. The therapeutic potential of modulating the VBC complex is being explored, with the aim of developing novel treatments that would restore the balance of protein turnover in affected cells. Notably, the use of small molecule inhibitors targeting specific components of the ubiquitin-system has shown promise in preclinical trials, offering a glimpse into what might be a new frontier in the treatment of degenerative diseases.
