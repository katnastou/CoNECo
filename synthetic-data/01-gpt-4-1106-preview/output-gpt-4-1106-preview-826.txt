prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: IL-15 receptor. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The IL-15 receptor, a critical component in the immunological signaling cascade, has recently become the focal point of numerous studies investigating its role in modulating immune responses. Characterized by its high-affinity binding to interleukin-15 (IL-15), the receptor functions predominantly within the context of lymphocyte activation and proliferation. In this latest exploration, we sought to understand the relationship between the IL-15 receptor and the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases. By employing a murine model of multiple sclerosis, we observed that subjects with a compromised signaling through the IL-15 receptor exhibited a pronounced reduction in the severity of autoimmune symptoms. Furthermore, our in vitro analyses revealed that the receptor's activation is imperative for the survival and cytolytic function of natural killer (NK) cells. Treatment with IL-15 in a controlled environment resulted in enhanced NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity, which suggests a potential therapeutic avenue for diseases characterized by immune dysregulation. The quantification of cytokine levels post IL-15 stimulation confirmed that, indeed, the IL-15 receptor is a pivotal modulator of immune homeostasis. These findings underscore the therapeutic potential of targeting the IL-15 receptor in conditions where immune surveillance and regulation are paramount.
