prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: alpha-glucosidase II. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: Alpha-glucosidase II plays a pivotal role in the maturation of nascent glycoproteins within the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) of eukaryotic cells. Its enzymatic action is critical for the proper trimming of glucose residues, a process that is essential for quality control mechanisms, such as the calnexin/calreticulin cycle. Recent studies have elucidated the mechanism by which alpha-glucosidase II recognizes and cleaves alpha-1,3-linked glucose moieties from the nascent oligosaccharide chains. The significance of this modulation is underscored by the fact that aberrant glycosylation patterns can result in the onset of various diseases, including congenital disorders of glycosylation. Moreover, investigations have demonstrated that specific inhibitors of alpha-glucosidase II, such as deoxynojirimycin derivatives, can have therapeutic potential for the treatment of viral infections, as the enzyme is instrumental in the life cycle of pathogens like the Hepatitis B virus. These findings highlight the complex yet critical nature of alpha-glucosidase II's function within cellular physiology and its implications for human health.
