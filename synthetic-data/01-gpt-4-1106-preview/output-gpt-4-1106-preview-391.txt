prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: MINOS. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In a recent study published in Cell, the functional implications of the mitochondrial inner membrane organizing system (MINOS) were elucidated through a series of in vitro and in vivo experiments. The structural integrity and dynamics of the mitochondrial network have long been attributed to the role of MINOS, but its precise contributions to mitochondrial homeostasis and disease pathology remained poorly understood. Using a combination of spectroscopy, electron microscopy, and live-cell imaging, the researchers characterized the interactions between MINOS and various phospholipids, revealing a direct role in maintaining mitochondrial membrane curvature and stability. Furthermore, the team employed murine models to investigate the systemic effects of MINOS dysfunction, noting a significant phenotypic overlap with clinical features observed in patients with mitochondriopathies. These observations suggest a critical role for MINOS in mitochondrial energy metabolism, with potential implications for the therapeutic targeting of mitochondrial disorders. The study propels our understanding of MINOS beyond structural descriptions towards a more integrated view of mitochondrial function and emphasizes the need for further exploration into the molecular mechanisms governing the maintenance of mitochondrial health.
