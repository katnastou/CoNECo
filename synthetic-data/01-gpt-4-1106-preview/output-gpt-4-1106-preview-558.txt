prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: CeBCD. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we sought to elucidate the functional role of the newly identified protein complex CeBCD in the regulation of cellular metabolism under conditions of oxidative stress. Embryonic fibroblasts were subjected to a controlled influx of reactive oxygen species (ROS) to simulate oxidative stress, after which the expression and activity levels of CeBCD were assessed using Western blot analysis and co-immunoprecipitation assays, respectively. Subsequent to ROS exposure, there was a marked increase in CeBCD expression, suggesting a potential role in the cellular response to oxidative damage. Inhibition of CeBCD using targeted siRNA knockdown resulted in heightened sensitivity of cells to oxidative stress, as evidenced by increased apoptosis rates and reduced cellular viability, affirming the importance of CeBCD in cellular defense mechanisms. Further analysis showed that cells deficient in CeBCD exhibited impaired glucose metabolism, hinting at a possible link between CeBCD and energy homeostasis during stress conditions. Comprehensive metabolomic profiling confirmed disruptions in key metabolic pathways, including glycolysis and the citric acid cycle, underscoring the pivotal role of CeBCD in maintaining metabolic balance in the face of oxidative challenges. Collectively, these findings reveal CeBCD as a critical mediator in the adaptive response of cells to oxidative stress, potentially providing novel therapeutic targets for diseases characterized by dysregulated oxidation-reduction homeostasis, such as cancer and neurodegenerative disorders.
