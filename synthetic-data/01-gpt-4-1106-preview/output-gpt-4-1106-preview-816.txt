prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: HAUS augmin. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The mitotic spindle is a dynamic microtubule-based structure essential for accurate chromosome segregation during cell division. A critical regulator of spindle dynamics is the HAUS augmin complex, which plays a pivotal role in the nucleation of new microtubules and their subsequent incorporation into the existing spindle apparatus. Recent studies have elucidated the mechanism by which HAUS augmin localizes to the spindle microtubules, where it facilitates the recruitment of gamma-tubulin ring complexes, thereby promoting microtubule nucleation. Dysregulation of HAUS augmin's function has been implicated in a variety of proliferative disorders, hinting at its potential as a novel therapeutic target in cancers characterized by aberrant cell division. In model organisms such as Drosophila melanogaster, perturbation of HAUS augmin activity results in defective spindle assembly and leads to aneuploidy, further underscoring its critical role in maintaining genomic stability. Current research efforts are focused on delineating the precise pathways through which HAUS augmin interacts with other cellular components to modulate spindle architecture and function, as well as elucidating how alterations in the complex contribute to the pathogenesis of mitotic abnormalities in diseased states.
