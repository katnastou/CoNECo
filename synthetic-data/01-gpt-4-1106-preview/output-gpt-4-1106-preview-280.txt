prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: Hrs/STAM. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In a recent study on endosomal sorting and signaling attenuation, significant attention has been given to the functioning of the Hrs/STAM protein complex. This complex is integral to the endosomal sorting machinery, which plays a pivotal role in the regulation of receptor-mediated signal transduction pathways. Dysregulation of endosomal trafficking has been associated with a variety of diseases, including cancer and neurodegenerative disorders. During endocytosis, the Hrs/STAM complex is recruited to the early endosome membranes, where it facilitates the sorting of ubiquitinated receptors into the internal vesicles of multivesicular bodies (MVBs), thereby earmarking them for lysosomal degradation. This process is essential not only for signal attenuation but also for maintaining cellular homeostasis and receptor density at the plasma membrane. In the present study, we have examined the influence of pH and various phospholipids on the activity of the Hrs/STAM complex. Our assays utilized fluorophore-tagged ubiquitin as a proxy to gauge the binding efficacy of the complex under different experimental conditions. The outcomes suggest that the functionality of the Hrs/STAM complex is modulated by the lipid environment, which has profound implications for understanding the mechanistic details of receptor downregulation in both normal and pathophysiological states.
