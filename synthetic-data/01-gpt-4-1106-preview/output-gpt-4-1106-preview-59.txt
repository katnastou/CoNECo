prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: CGRP receptor. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: Recent advancements in the elucidation of migraine pathophysiology have spotlighted the role of the CGRP receptor in the modulation of nociceptive pathways within the central nervous system. Substantial evidence has emerged, indicating that the CGRP receptor is intricately involved in the cascade of events leading to the vasodilation of cerebral vessels, a hallmark of migraine episodes. In this context, selective antagonists for the CGRP receptor have been developed and assessed for their therapeutic efficacy. Clinical trials have reported a reduction in migraine frequency upon administration of these antagonists, suggesting that the binding of endogenous CGRP to its cognate receptor is critical for the maintenance of migraine pathology. Additionally, investigations employing rodent models of migraine have provided insight into the receptor's expression patterns across different neuronal populations, revealing a potential correlation between receptor density and the susceptibility to migraine attacks. These findings underscore the importance of the CGRP receptor as a strategic target for intervention and open avenues for the development of novel treatments that promise to ameliorate the burdens imposed by this debilitating condition.
