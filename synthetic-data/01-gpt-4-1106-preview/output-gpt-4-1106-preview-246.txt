prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: FtsBL. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In the present study, we elucidate the interactions and functional implications of the FtsBL complex in bacterial cytokinesis. Integrating structural bioinformatics with in vitro experimentation, we observed that the FtsBL complex exhibits a high-affinity binding to specific phospholipid constituents within the inner membrane, suggesting a role in membrane curvature and stability during cell division. Our kinetic assays further revealed that the presence of divalent cations, particularly magnesium ions, enhances the oligomerization of the complex, a process essential for maintaining the integrity of the septal ring. We additionally employed fluorescence microscopy to track the temporal dynamics of the FtsBL complex in Escherichia coli under varying osmotic conditions, revealing its pivotal role in adapting to environmental stresses. Impressively, in the presence of the antibiotic cephalexin, which targets cell wall synthesis, the FtsBL complex demonstrated an accelerated assembly rate, hinting at a potential compensatory mechanism aimed at overcoming cell wall perturbation. These insights deepen our understanding of the molecular orchestration of bacterial cell division and provide a promising context for the development of novel antimicrobial strategies targeting the FtsBL complex to combat antibiotic resistance.
