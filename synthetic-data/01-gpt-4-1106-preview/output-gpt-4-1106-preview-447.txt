prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: complex III. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In the current study, we investigated the role of complex III in the mitochondrial respiratory chain and its association with the pathogenesis of a specific subset of metabolic disorders. Notably, complex III is crucial for the electron transport chain, facilitating the transfer of electrons from reduced coenzyme Q10 to cytochrome c, while concurrently pumping protons from the mitochondrial matrix to the intermembrane space. This proton gradient ultimately drives the synthesis of adenosine triphosphate (ATP). Deficiencies in complex III activity can lead to an accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and a subsequent decrease in cellular ATP levels, potentially contributing to the onset of mitochondrial myopathies. The study utilized a murine model to elucidate the physiological impact of impaired complex III function. Upon treatment with pharmacological agents that selectively inhibit complex III, there was a marked increase in oxidative stress markers in muscle tissues, paralleled by a decline in motor function. These findings suggest that targeted interventions to enhance complex III activity may hold therapeutic promise for individuals suffering from mitochondrial diseases characterized by compromised oxidative phosphorylation. Further clinical investigations are warranted to assess the viability of such strategies in human populations and to better understand the complex III-dependent pathways that underlie mitochondrial dysfunction in metabolic disorders.
