prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: Rdr1. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we characterized the biological function of the Rdr1 protein complex in the context of immune response modulation in Mus musculus models. Specifically, we investigated the role of Rdr1 in the signaling pathways activated upon infection with Listeria monocytogenes. Our experiments utilized a combination of quantitative proteomics and gene expression analyses to ascertain the downstream effects of Rdr1 manipulation. Upon bacterial challenge, mice with attenuated Rdr1 expression exhibited a compromised production of cytokines, including interleukin-6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-Î±), suggesting a pivotal role for Rdr1 in orchestrating an effective immune response. Remarkably, restoration of Rdr1 levels was correlated with a significant amelioration in the clearance of the bacterial infection, thus establishing a link between Rdr1 function and host defense mechanisms. The biochemical assays confirmed that Rdr1 does not directly interact with these cytokines, positing a more upstream regulatory role in immune signaling cascades. These findings provide important insights into how the Rdr1 protein complex contributes to the pathophysiology of bacterial infections and offer a potential target for novel therapeutic interventions.
