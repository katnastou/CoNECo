prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: Pol epsilon. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we sought to elucidate the role of Pol epsilon in the maintenance of genomic stability during the process of DNA replication in eukaryotic cells. The fidelity of DNA replication is of utmost importance to prevent the occurrence of mutations that can lead to diseases such as cancer. Pol epsilon, a key player in this process, is responsible for the leading strand DNA synthesis. The integrity of its function was assessed by analyzing the rate of replication fork progression and the error rates associated with nucleotide incorporation. Utilizing a combination of chromatin immunoprecipitation and next-generation sequencing, we observed that the activity of Pol epsilon is critical for the adherence to the replication timing program. Additionally, our results suggested that perturbations in the function of Pol epsilon lead to an increase in DNA replication stress, evident from an upsurge in double-strand breaks and the activation of the DNA damage response pathway. In vivo experiments employing model organisms further corroborated the in vitro findings, as defects in Pol epsilon were associated with increased sensitivity to replication-blocking agents and elevated rates of spontaneous mutations. Collectively, our data underscore the essential nature of Pol epsilon in preserving the genomic integrity of cells, providing insights into its potential role as a target for therapeutic interventions in diseases characterized by genomic instability.
