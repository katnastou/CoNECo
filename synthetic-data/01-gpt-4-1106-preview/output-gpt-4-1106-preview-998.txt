prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: laminin-4. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In recent studies, the role of the extracellular matrix (ECM) in neurodegenerative diseases has garnered significant attention, with a specific focus on the perturbation of matrix constituents such as laminin-4 in the central nervous system (CNS). Laminin-4, a critical component of the basal lamina, has been implicated in maintaining synaptic stability and facilitating neuronal regeneration. An in vivo investigation utilizing a murine model of Alzheimer's disease revealed that the disruption of laminin-4 homeostasis in hippocampal regions coincided with an increase in amyloid-beta deposition, suggesting a potential contributory mechanism to disease progression. The examination of post-mortem human tissue samples corroborated these findings, wherein a marked decrease in laminin-4 was observed in the cerebral cortex of patients with advanced Alzheimer's pathology in comparison to age-matched controls. Concurrently, in vitro assays demonstrated that neuronal exposure to oxidative stress resulted in the downregulation of laminin-4, further implicating its role in the neuroprotective response. These outcomes posit laminin-4 not only as a potential biomarker for disease onset and advancement but also as a candidate for therapeutic intervention strategies aimed at ameliorating the downstream effects of ECM remodeling within the diseased CNS.
