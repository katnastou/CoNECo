prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: DNA polymerase Vs. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In the recent study aimed at elucidating the mechanisms underlying genome replication fidelity, the role of DNA polymerase Vs in the cascade of cellular events has been a focal point. The current research utilized a combination of chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by high-throughput sequencing (ChIP-seq) to analyze the spatial-temporal binding pattern of DNA polymerase Vs during the S phase of the cell cycle in human fibroblasts. The results demonstrated a preferential association of DNA polymerase Vs with regions adjacent to replication forks, suggesting a pivotal role in synthesizing the lagging DNA strand. Moreover, the interaction between DNA polymerase Vs and the replication machinery appeared to be tightly regulated, as evidenced by a marked decrease in binding affinity following treatment with hydroxyurea, an inhibitor of ribonucleotide reductase and an inducer of replication stress. In addition, the capacity of DNA polymerase Vs to sustain replication progression was further assessed by exposing cells to ultraviolet radiation, which causes DNA damage by forming cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers. Remarkably, DNA polymerase Vs showed enhanced binding to damaged sites, implicating this complex in the cellular response to DNA damage and potentially in the process of translesion synthesis. Collectively, these findings provide valuable insights into the multifaceted roles of DNA polymerase Vs in maintaining genomic stability under both normal and stress conditions, advancing our understanding of the molecular orchestration of DNA replication and repair pathways.
