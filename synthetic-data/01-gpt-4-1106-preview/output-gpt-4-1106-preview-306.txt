prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: laminin-221. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we explored the therapeutic potential of laminin-221 in the context of Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), a debilitating condition characterized by progressive muscle weakening and degeneration. Previous investigations have suggested a link between the extracellular matrix (ECM) and muscle integrity, but the specific role of laminin-221 remained elusive. To examine the effects of laminin-221 administration in vivo, we utilized a murine model tailored to mimic the pathophysiological aspects of DMD. Mice were treated with intramuscular injections of laminin-221, and subsequent analysis indicated a marked improvement in muscle architecture as compared to control subjects. Functional assays demonstrated enhanced muscular force generation, and histological sections revealed a reduction in fibrotic tissue deposition. Additionally, there was a significant decrease in serum creatine kinase levels, an enzyme indicative of muscle damage, suggesting that laminin-221 may confer protective benefits to muscle fibers. These findings illuminate the potential of laminin-221 as a modulator of the ECM, providing a scaffold for regenerative processes and offering a novel therapeutic avenue for the management of DMD. Further research is warranted to decipher the molecular mechanisms underlying laminin-221's effects and to evaluate its long-term efficacy and safety profile in larger, more diverse cohorts.
