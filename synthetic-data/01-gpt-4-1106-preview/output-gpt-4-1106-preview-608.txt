prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: box C/D snoRNP. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In recent studies, the role of the box C/D snoRNP complex has garnered considerable interest within the field of epitranscriptomics, particularly due to its involvement in the 2'-O-methylation of ribosomal RNA (rRNA), a critical post-transcriptional modification process pivotal for the proper assembly and function of the ribosome. Observations in Saccharomyces cerevisiae have illuminated the intricate choreography between the box C/D snoRNP complex and the pre-ribosomal particles, suggesting that this interaction is vital for rRNA processing and ribosome biogenesis. Dysfunction in this pathway has been correlated with a multitude of pathologies, most notably ribosomopathies, which encompass a spectrum of diseases characterized by defective ribosomal assembly and function. Moreover, pharmacological efforts to modulate the activity of the box C/D snoRNP complex have revealed potential therapeutic avenues for targeting diseases that arise from aberrant ribosome biogenesis. The specificity of this complex in catalyzing 2'-O-methylation presents an attractive target for selective intervention, making the box C/D snoRNP complex not only a biochemical subject of interest but also a promising candidate in drug development strategies aimed at mitigating ribosomopathies.
