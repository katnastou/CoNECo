prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: SPC. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In an effort to elucidate the mechanisms underpinning cellular homeostasis, recent investigations have focused on characterizing the role of the SPC within the context of metabolic regulation. The current study utilizes a combination of high-resolution mass spectrometry and cryo-electron microscopy to explore the SPC's structural dynamics in response to oxidative stress, a common perturbation associated with a multitude of pathologies, including neurodegenerative disorders and cancer. To simulate physiological conditions, human-derived cell lines were exposed to a controlled influx of reactive oxygen species (ROS) while monitoring the subsequent cellular responses. Initial findings suggest that the presence of the SPC appears critical in maintaining metabolic efficiency during oxidative challenges. Interestingly, perturbations in the SPC's activity were correlated with marked alterations in lipid metabolism, suggesting a possible intersection between SPC function and lipid homeostasis. As lipid dysregulation is a contributing factor to the pathophysiology of diabetes, understanding the multifaceted role of the SPC could illuminate new therapeutic targets. Moreover, preliminary data imply that the SPC may participate in mitophagy, thereby implicating this protein complex in the broader spectrum of cellular quality control mechanisms. These insights pave the way for a deeper comprehension of the SPC's involvement in maintaining cellular equilibrium, with potential ramifications for the development of novel diagnostic and therapeutic strategies.
