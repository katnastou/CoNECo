prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: ADA HAT. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In a recent pharmacological investigation aiming to elucidate the mechanisms underlying cardiac hypertrophy, researchers have postulated a significant interplay between metabolic pathways and chromatin remodeling processes, particularly focusing on the role of the ADA HAT complex. The study employed various murine models to determine the impact of ADA HAT inhibition on maladaptive cardiac remodeling, which is a common pathological precursor to heart failure. Clinically-relevant doses of a small molecule inhibitor targeting the enzymatic activity of the ADA HAT complex were administered, and subsequent echocardiographic analyses revealed a marked attenuation of hypertrophic growth in treated animals compared to controls. Additionally, histological assessment showed reduced fibrotic deposition in the myocardium, indicating an amelioration of extracellular matrix dysregulation. Metabolomic profiling complemented these findings by demonstrating a restoration of fatty acid oxidation processes, which are often compromised in the hypertrophic heart. This data suggests that targeting the ADA HAT complex may offer a novel therapeutic avenue for the treatment of cardiac hypertrophy and its sequelae in human patients, warranting further research into the development of ADA HAT-specific inhibitors with high selectivity and potency.
