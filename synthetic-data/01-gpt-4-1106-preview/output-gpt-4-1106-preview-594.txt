prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: ORC. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In a recent groundbreaking study, the essential role of the Origin Recognition Complex (ORC) in eukaryotic DNA replication initiation has been further elucidated. The affinity of the ORC for specific DNA sequences was demonstrated to be critical for the formation of pre-replicative complexes, a finding that reinforces its fundamental position in cell cycle regulation. Moreover, experiments utilizing Saccharomyces cerevisiae as a model organism revealed novel insights into the mechanism by which the ORC coordinates with various replication factors to ensure timely and accurate DNA synthesis. Disruption of ORC function through targeted mutations resulted in pronounced defects in replication timing, which subsequently led to genomic instability, a condition often associated with proliferative diseases such as cancer. The data, therefore, underscore the significance of maintaining ORC integrity for the preservation of genome fidelity. Further investigation into the molecular interactions of ORC may reveal potential therapeutic targets for the development of novel anticancer agents, aiming to leverage dysregulations in the replication machinery of malignant cells.
