prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: NEF1. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The multifaceted role of NEF1 in cellular homeostasis is underscored by its implication in various signal transduction pathways. Recent investigations have elucidated that NEF1 interacts with specific receptors on the cell surface, leading to the modulation of intracellular calcium levels, a key factor in both cellular proliferation and apoptosis. This protein complex has been observed to affect the phosphorylation state of several secondary messenger systems, delineating a clearer understanding of its intricate role in the regulation of cell cycle progression. Interestingly, in a mouse model of ischemia-reperfusion injury, overexpression of NEF1 was correlated with a reduction in tissue damage, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target. The intricate balance maintained by NEF1 is crucial for cellular responses to oxidative stress, positing that aberrations in its function may be linked to the pathogenesis of certain cardiovascular diseases. Yet, the full array of physiological contexts and the breadth of NEF1's interaction with other cellular constituents eludes the current scientific narrative, prompting a call for more focused studies to unravel its mechanistic contributions to cell biology and disease states.
