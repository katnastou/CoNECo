prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: NUMAC. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In recent investigations, the role of the nucleosome remodeling complex known as NUMAC has been illuminated concerning its impact on chromatin structure and subsequent gene expression regulation. The precise modulation of chromatin architecture by NUMAC is critical, as it ensures the timely access of transcription factors to DNA sequences, thereby influencing cellular differentiation processes. This complex achieves its function through ATP-dependent remodeling activities, which allow for the sliding of nucleosomes along the DNA, ultimately altering accessibility within the chromatin landscape. In addition, NUMAC has been implicated in the DNA damage response, aiding in the repair of double-strand breaksâ€”a crucial factor in maintaining genomic stability. Dysregulation of NUMAC activity has been observed in various cancers, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target. In vitro assays utilizing human cell lines have demonstrated that pharmacological inhibition of NUMAC leads to altered expression of genes involved in cell cycle progression, hinting at a complex interplay between NUMAC function and cellular proliferation dynamics. Further research is necessary to delineate the full spectrum of NUMAC's biological activities and its potential use in cancer therapy.
