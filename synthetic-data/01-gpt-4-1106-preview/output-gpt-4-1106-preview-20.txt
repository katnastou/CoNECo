prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: PDGF-AB-receptor alpha. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The dynamic interplay between growth factors and their respective receptors plays a pivotal role in the modulation of cellular processes fundamental to tissue regeneration and repair. In this regard, PDGF-AB-receptor alpha has emerged as a critical modulator in the signaling cascade that governs cell proliferation, migration, and extracellular matrix remodeling. In a recent study, the activation kinetics of PDGF-AB-receptor alpha were meticulously characterized in human dermal fibroblasts, revealing a temporally controlled phosphorylation pattern following exposure to its ligand. The downstream signaling events were shown to significantly influence wound healing efficacy in murine models. The application of small-molecule inhibitors specifically targeting the kinase activity of PDGF-AB-receptor alpha demonstrated a substantial decrease in fibroblast proliferation rates, which could have therapeutic implications for the management of fibrotic diseases. Moreover, these findings underscore the potential of PDGF-AB-receptor alpha as a biomarker for disease progression in tissue fibrosis and underscore the therapeutic value of modulating this specific pathway in the context of chronic wound care in patients with diabetes mellitus. By selectively manipulating the activity patterns of PDGF-AB-receptor alpha, novel tailored strategies may be devised to augment tissue repair mechanisms while mitigating the deleterious outcomes associated with overactive fibroproliferative responses.
