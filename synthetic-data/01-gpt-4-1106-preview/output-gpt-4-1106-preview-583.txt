prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: yeast spliceosomal complex B. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: Recent studies have elucidated the role of the yeast spliceosomal complex B during the intricate process of pre-mRNA splicing in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. This large ribonucleoprotein assembly is essential for the excision of intronic sequences, thereby facilitating the maturation of messenger RNA. In the current investigation, we sought to determine the impact of ATP depletion on the stability and function of the yeast spliceosomal complex B. Yeast cells were subjected to pharmacological inhibition of oxidative phosphorylation, leading to a pronounced reduction in intracellular ATP levels. Consequent to this metabolic perturbation, the yeast spliceosomal complex B exhibited a decreased affinity for its RNA substrates, as evidenced by mobility shift assays. This biochemical phenotype corresponded with a measurable defect in splicing efficiency, substantiating the notion that ATP is critical for the dynamic rearrangements and enzymatic processes inherent to the spliceosome's function. Importantly, the observed splicing impairments seem to correlate with cellular stress responses, hinting at a potential link between energy metabolism and the regulation of gene expression in yeast. Further research into the mechanistic underpinnings of this relationship may provide new insights into the effects of metabolic states on post-transcriptional gene regulation and illuminate novel therapeutic avenues for diseases characterized by splicing anomalies.
