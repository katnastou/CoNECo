prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: PEP-B. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In a recent landmark study, the role of the protein complex PEP-B in cellular metabolism was elucidated through a combination of crystallography and in vivo experiments in Mus musculus models. The PEP-B complex was shown to play a crucial role in the regulation of glycolytic flux, particularly under conditions of metabolic stress, such as hypoxia or nutrient deprivation. Immunoprecipitation assays followed by mass spectrometry analysis confirmed the presence of PEP-B in liver tissues, suggesting its involvement in gluconeogenesis. In addition, targeted inhibition of PEP-B via small molecule inhibitors led to significant alterations in lactate production, indicating its potential as a therapeutic target in metabolic disorders. Intriguingly, dysregulation of PEP-B was also implicated in the progression of diabetes mellitus, with diabetic subjects showing altered levels of the complex in comparison to healthy controls. These findings shed new light on the multifaceted role of PEP-B in energy homeostasis and provide a foundation for the development of novel therapeutic strategies against metabolic diseases.
