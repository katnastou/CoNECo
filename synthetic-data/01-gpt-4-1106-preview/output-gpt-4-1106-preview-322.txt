prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: SSR. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In recent investigations into cellular transport mechanisms, the significance of the SSR protein complex has been underscored by observing its role in the translocation of polypeptides across the endoplasmic reticulum membrane. SSR's interaction with the translocon appears to be pivotal in the post-translational modification pathway, particularly influencing glycosylation patterns. Using an in vitro assay derived from *Saccharomyces cerevisiae* cellular extracts, it was demonstrated that SSR deficiency leads to an accumulation of misfolded proteins, emphasizing its function in protein quality control. The implications of this defect were further examined in a mammalian model, where the dysregulation of SSR was correlated with an increased susceptibility to neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease. Additionally, the application of chemical chaperones in restoring the function of the SSR complex highlighted a potential therapeutic avenue, which could ameliorate the detriments linked to its impaired activity. This study presents the SSR complex not only as a critical component in the maintenance of cellular homeostasis but also offers a novel perspective on the pathogenesis of protein-folding diseases, opening doors for innovative interventions in treatment strategies.
