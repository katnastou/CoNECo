prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: Prohibitin. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In the quest to elucidate the molecular underpinnings of age-associated pathologies, recent investigations have shed light on the pivotal role that the Prohibitin protein complex plays within the mitochondrial landscape. Prohibitin, a highly conserved scaffolding complex located in the inner mitochondrial membrane, has garnered attention due to its multifaceted involvement in mitochondrial integrity and function. In this study, we sought to explore the impact of Prohibitin dysregulation in murine models, drawing connections between impaired mitochondrial dynamics and the progression of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's. Our experiments employed a battery of cellular assays, revealing that the perturbation of Prohibitin expression resulted in a marked decrease in mitochondrial respiratory efficiency, leading to elevated reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. Furthermore, Prohibitin deficiency was correlated with a disruption in mitochondrial morphology and a concomitant decline in neuronal viability. Our findings suggest that therapeutic strategies aimed at modulating Prohibitin levels could hold promise for mitigating mitochondrial dysfunction and, by extension, slowing or reversing the degenerative processes inherent to a myriad of age-related disorders.
