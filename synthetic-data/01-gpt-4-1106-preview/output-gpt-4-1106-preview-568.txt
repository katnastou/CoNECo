prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: mitochondrial 28S ribosomal subunit. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In a recent study, we have elucidated the role of the mitochondrial 28S ribosomal subunit in the context of cellular respiration and its implications in mitochondrial diseases. The research focused on the mitochondrial 28S ribosomal subunit's involvement in synthesizing proteins required for the electron transport chain's functionality. The study utilized both in vitro and in vivo models, including murine samples, to observe the subunit's influence on mitochondrial protein synthesis. Exposure to chemical inhibitors, such as chloramphenicol, allowed for the observation of the subunit's response under conditions of impaired translation. Data unveiled a direct correlation between the effectiveness of oxidative phosphorylation and the structural integrity of the mitochondrial 28S ribosomal subunit. Moreover, patient-derived cells, manifesting pathologies akin to Leigh syndrome, demonstrated that mutations affecting the subunit's stability led to a marked decrease in ATP production, unveiling therapeutic targets for this debilitating condition. In sum, the mitochondrial 28S ribosomal subunit has proven to be a pivotal element in the maintenance of mitochondrial function, and its impairment has far-reaching consequences on cellular metabolism and energy homeostasis.
