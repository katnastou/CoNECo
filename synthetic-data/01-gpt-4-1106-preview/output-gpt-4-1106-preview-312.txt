prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: CPSF. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: Cleavage and polyadenylation specificity factor (CPSF) plays a crucial role in the post-transcriptional modification of mRNA precursors, a process that is integral to gene expression regulation in eukaryotic cells. The involvement of CPSF in the recognition and cleavage of the 3'-end of pre-mRNA, followed by polyadenylation, is essential for the maturation of mRNA and its subsequent translation efficiency. Recent investigations have elucidated that aberrations in CPSF activity are implicated in a myriad of diseases, including certain cancers and neurological disorders. In the current study, we sought to determine CPSF's specific interaction with various chemical inhibitors to assess its potential as a therapeutic target. Our findings illustrate that modulation of CPSF by selective small molecules results in altered mRNA transcript profiles in cultured human cells, suggesting a possible avenue for the development of novel therapeutic strategies. Furthermore, CPSF's role in mRNA processing makes it a candidate for further exploration in the context of infectious diseases, where viral replication may hinge on the exploitation of host cellular mechanisms. The elucidation of CPSF's complex regulatory network and its interaction with chemical modulators paves the way for a more profound understanding of mRNA metabolism and its implications for disease pathology and treatment.
