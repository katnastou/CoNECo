prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: CTDK-I. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In the pursuit to decipher the regulatory mechanisms governing transcriptional fidelity, researchers have turned their attention towards the role of protein complexes, and one such entity that has garnered interest is CTDK-I. This particular complex has demonstrated a pivotal function in the covalent modification of RNA polymerase II, ensuring the precise transition from initiation to elongation during mRNA synthesis. The significance of CTDK-I was underscored in a recent study analyzing its interaction with various phosphorylation sites, which conferred an increased resilience to transcriptional stress. Investigations utilizing Saccharomyces cerevisiae as a model organism revealed that, upon exposure to oxidative stress induced by hydrogen peroxide, cells deficient in CTDK-I exhibited marked transcriptome-wide defects. This defect manifested as a pronounced sensitivity to cytotoxic agents, implicating CTDK-I in the broader context of cellular responses to genotoxic stress. Consequently, a deeper understanding of CTDK-I's mechanism of action could unravel new therapeutic strategies for diseases characterized by transcriptional dysregulation, such as certain types of cancer, underscoring the intricate relationships between transcriptional control and cellular homeostasis.
