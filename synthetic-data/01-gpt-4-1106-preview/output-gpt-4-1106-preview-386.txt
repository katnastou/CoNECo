prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: alphav-beta3 integrin. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In the recent study, the interaction between alphav-beta3 integrin and osteopontin was examined in the context of metastatic breast cancer progression. The cell adhesion assay demonstrated that the binding affinity of alphav-beta3 integrin to osteopontin was significantly enhanced in the presence of extracellular magnesium ions, suggesting a critical role for divalent cations in the modulation of this interaction. Additionally, in vivo experiments utilizing a murine model indicated that the blockade of alphav-beta3 integrin by specific inhibitors resulted in a marked reduction in bone metastases, pointing to the potential utility of targeting this protein complex in therapeutic interventions. Immunohistochemical analysis of bone metastatic lesions further confirmed the upregulation of alphav-beta3 integrin, correlating with increased tumor invasiveness and the activation of downstream signaling pathways implicated in cell survival and angiogenesis. Collectively, these findings provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying bone-specific metastasis in breast cancer and underscore the significance of alphav-beta3 integrin as a promising target for the development of novel anti-metastatic agents.
