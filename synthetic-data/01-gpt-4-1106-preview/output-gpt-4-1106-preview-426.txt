prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose-2,6-biphosphatase 2. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In a recent study, researchers sought to elucidate the regulatory mechanisms governing glucose homeostasis in response to oscillating energy demands within mammalian tissues. Central to this investigation was the enzymatic characterization of 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose-2,6-biphosphatase 2, a bifunctional protein complex integral to the modulation of glycolytic and gluconeogenic pathways. This protein complex catalyzes both the synthesis and degradation of fructose-2,6-bisphosphate, a potent allosteric effector that fine-tunes the activity of phosphofructokinase-1 and fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase, key regulatory enzymes at the branching point between glycolysis and gluconeogenesis. In a series of experiments, the expression levels of this protein complex were quantitatively determined in hepatic cells under varying conditions of metabolic stress, such as fasting and refeeding cycles. Additionally, the role of this protein complex in pathophysiological states was extrapolated through its activity profiling in a murine model of Type 2 diabetes. The findings suggested a significant alteration in the enzymatic activity of 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose-2,6-biphosphatase 2 under hyperglycemic conditions, indicating a potential therapeutic target for modulating glucose levels in diabetic patients.
