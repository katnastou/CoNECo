prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: GABA-A receptor. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we sought to elucidate the pharmacological modulation of the GABA-A receptor and its associated effects on neuronal excitability. The GABA-A receptor, a pivotal inhibitory receptor in the central nervous system, has been a prime target for therapeutics aimed at ameliorating conditions characterized by neuronal hyperexcitability, such as epilepsy. Through a series of in vitro assays, we evaluated the binding affinity of various ligands and observed that those which acted as positive allosteric modulators of the GABA-A receptor significantly enhanced chloride ion flux across the neuronal membrane. To assess the in vivo relevance of these findings, adult mice models were treated with selected ligands, resulting in a dose-dependent decrease in seizure susceptibility. Importantly, chronic administration did not markedly alter receptor expression levels in the cerebral cortex, indicating a low propensity for tolerance development. These results highlight the GABA-A receptor as a robust therapeutic target and suggest that modulation of this receptor complex can yield promising outcomes for the treatment of epilepsy without deleterious adaptations within the receptorâ€™s expression or function. Moreover, the safety profile of these ligands in the context of receptor integrity underscores their potential for long-term therapeutic use.
