prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: Nic96. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In an effort to delineate the mechanistic underpinnings of nuclear pore complex (NPC) assembly, recent investigations have focused on dissecting the role of the Nic96 protein complex. This vital architectural component is imperative for the structural integrity and function of the NPC, which serves as a crucial gateway regulating nucleocytoplasmic transport in eukaryotic cells. Studies employing biochemical assays and cryo-electron microscopy have revealed that Nic96 interacts with key nucleoporins to stabilize the NPC framework, thereby facilitating the selective transit of molecules. Moreover, dysregulation of Nic96 has been implicated in a spectrum of pathological conditions. For instance, aberrant expression of this complex has been observed in cellular models of cancer, suggesting a potential role in oncogenic processes. Furthermore, the use of small molecule inhibitors has provided insights into the therapeutic potential of targeting Nic96 for modulating NPC activity in disease states. Through the application of advanced proteomic techniques, the precise mapping of the Nic96 interactome continues to enhance our understanding of nuclear transport phenomena and its implications for cellular homeostasis and disease pathogenesis.
