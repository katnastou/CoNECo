prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: PGGT. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we sought to elucidate the role of PGGT in the modulation of intracellular signaling pathways under oxidative stress conditions. The research employed both in vitro and in vivo experimental models to determine the impact of PGGT activity on cell survival and apoptosis resistance mechanisms when exposed to elevated levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Murine fibroblasts with a knocked-down expression of PGGT were found to be considerably more susceptible to ROS-induced cytotoxicity, indicating that PGGT plays a critical cytoprotective role. Furthermore, pharmacological inhibition of PGGT led to increased cellular sensitivity to the anti-neoplastic agent cisplatin, suggesting a potential therapeutic application in cancer treatment. In an in vivo Drosophila model of oxidative stress, alterations to PGGT levels significantly affected lifespan and stress resistance phenotypes. These results implicate PGGT as a pivotal player in cellular defense mechanisms against oxidative damage and provide a foundation for subsequent investigations geared towards exploring the therapeutic manipulation of PGGT activity in the context of diseases characterized by dysregulated redox homeostasis.
