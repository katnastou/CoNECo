prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: HDL3. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: Recent studies have elucidated the role of HDL3, a subclass of high-density lipoprotein (HDL), in modulating lipid metabolism and atheroprotection. In this research, we rigorously quantified the concentration of HDL3 in human plasma samples and assessed its correlation with cardiovascular health. Our cohort consisted of adult participants spanning a spectrum of metabolic conditions, including obesity, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and hypercholesterolemia. We observed that individuals with a higher plasma concentration of HDL3 exhibited a significant reduction in the incidence of atherosclerotic lesions. Notably, HDL3 concentrations appeared to inversely correlate with levels of systemic inflammatory markers, such as C-reactive protein (CRP), suggesting an anti-inflammatory property of this lipoprotein subfraction. In vitro assays revealed that HDL3 facilitates the efflux of cholesterol from macrophages, a crucial step in reverse cholesterol transport, and interacts with endothelial cells to promote vasodilatory responses, potentially via the endothelium-derived nitric oxide (NO) signaling pathway. Our findings underscore the potential therapeutic implications of HDL3 in the prevention and treatment of cardiovascular diseases and pave the way for future studies aimed at harnessing its beneficial properties.
