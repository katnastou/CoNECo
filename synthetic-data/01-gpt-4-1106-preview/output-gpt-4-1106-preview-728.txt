prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: FtsEX. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In a compelling study recently published in the *Journal of Cellular Microbiology*, the functionality of the prokaryotic divisome was elucidated with a specific focus on the role of the FtsEX complex in peptidoglycan remodeling during cell division. The FtsEX complex, an ATP-binding cassette transporter, was demonstrated to be crucial for recruiting downstream enzymatic components essential for cell wall synthesis. Utilizing Escherichia coli as a model organism, the experiments employed fluorescent microscopy to observe the temporal and spatial dynamics of FtsEX during cytokinesis. The findings revealed that the localization of FtsEX is highly regulated and corresponds with the formation of the septal ring structure. Furthermore, biochemical assays have confirmed FtsEX's direct interaction with substrates involved in peptidoglycan synthesis, indicating its substantive role in the transfer of chemical energy from ATP hydrolysis during cellular constriction. These insights contribute to the broader understanding of bacterial cytokinesis and may offer therapeutic implications; targeting the FtsEX complex could potentially lead to the development of novel antibiotics capable of disrupting the division of pathogenic bacteria, thus aiding in the fight against antibiotic-resistant infections. The study highlights a significant advancement in our comprehension of the intricate mechanisms governing bacterial cell proliferation and the potential pharmacological targets within these pathways.
