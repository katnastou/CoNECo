prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: OSTCI. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: Recent studies have elucidated the involvement of the oligomeric protein complex OSTCI in the modulation of lipid metabolism within hepatic cells. In a robust cohort of animal models, OSTCI demonstrated a significant regulatory effect on lipid homeostasis, which suggests it may play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Quantitative proteomic analyses revealed that upon induction of metabolic stress through a high-fat diet, OSTCI expression was markedly upregulated. This upregulation coincided with an aberrant accumulation of triglycerides within the hepatocytes, indicative of disrupted lipid processing. Furthermore, in vitro assays using cultured hepatocytes treated with pharmacological inhibitors of OSTCI exhibited a substantial decrease in lipid droplet formation, implicating this protein complex as a potential therapeutic target. Notably, downstream effects of OSTCI perturbation included alterations in the cellular levels of reactive oxygen species, underscoring the multifaceted role of OSTCI in maintaining cellular homeostasis. Given these findings, future research is warranted to investigate the therapeutic efficacy of targeting OSTCI in the treatment of NAFLD and its associated metabolic dysfunctions.
