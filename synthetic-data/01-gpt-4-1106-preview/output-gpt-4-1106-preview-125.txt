prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: MAT. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In an attempt to elucidate the role of metabolic pathways in cancer progression, our recent study has focused on the Methionine Adenosyltransferase (MAT) protein complex and its catalytic contribution to the synthesis of S-adenosylmethionine (SAM), a methyl donor critical for epigenetic modifications. Deregulation of these pathways has been noted as a crucial factor in the onset and development of hepatocellular carcinoma. Our investigation employed various human cell lines to model the impact of altered MAT activity, assessing proliferative and apoptotic indexes upon exposure to different concentrations of exogenous methionine. Additionally, pharmacological inhibition of MAT was observed to have a deleterious effect on cell viability, implicating its potential as a therapeutic target. Pertinent to our findings, the reactive oxygen species levels within these systems were quantitatively measured to infer oxidative stress as a contributing factor to cellular dysfunction in diseased states. The analysis was further augmented by metabolic profiling, which delineated the shifts in metabolite concentrations corresponding to modifications in MAT activity. Collectively, these results provide a putative link between MAT function and cellular homeostasis, underscoring the need for detailed explorations into MAT-associated regulatory mechanisms that may inform the development of precision medicine approaches for cancer treatment.
