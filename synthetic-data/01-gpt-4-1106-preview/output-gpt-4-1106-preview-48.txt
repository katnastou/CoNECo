prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: Nup84. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In the current study, we evaluated the functional significance of the Nup84 protein complex in cellular homeostasis through a series of intricate in vitro and in vivo experiments. Notably, the integrity of the nuclear envelope appeared compromised under conditions of Nup84 downregulation, as evidenced by an aberration in selective nucleo-cytoplasmic transport assays. Interestingly, the disruption of the Nup84 complex led to an accumulation of reactive oxygen species, suggesting that Nup84 may play a role in cellular oxidative stress response mechanisms. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae models, the attenuation of Nup84 expression resulted in a pronounced sensitivity to environmental stressors, including heat shock and exposure to the antifungal agent amphotericin B. Furthermore, cancer cell lines with impaired Nup84 functionality exhibited reduced proliferative capacity, underlining the potential of targeting this complex in therapeutic strategies. Collectively, these findings elucidate the critical contributions of Nup84 in maintaining cellular architecture and stress management, with implications for understanding the molecular pathology of diseases where nucleocytoplasmic transport is dysregulated.
