prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: MukBEF condensin. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: Recent advancements in the understanding of chromosome architecture have shed light on the pivotal role of the MukBEF condensin complex in the maintenance of genomic integrity. The highly conserved nature of this protein complex across various organisms underscores its essential function in chromosome condensation and segregation during cell division. In a series of innovative experiments, the dynamics of MukBEF condensin interactions were elucidated using single-molecule fluorescence microscopy, revealing that its activity is finely regulated by ATP hydrolysis cycles. Furthermore, the implications of MukBEF condensin malfunction in the pathogenesis of certain chromosomal instability disorders have begun to emerge, prompting investigations into its therapeutic potential. In an attempt to link the complex's molecular functions to physiological processes, studies involving Saccharomyces cerevisiae as a model organism have proven invaluable. Meanwhile, pharmacological interventions targeting the ATPase activity of the MukBEF condensin complex are being explored as novel approaches for the treatment of specific neoplastic diseases characterized by gross chromosomal rearrangements. Such research endeavors continue to elucidate the intricate web of interactions and regulations surrounding this essential protein complex, providing promising avenues for biomedical innovation and disease management.
