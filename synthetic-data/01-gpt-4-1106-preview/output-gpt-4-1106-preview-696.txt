prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: yFACT. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In the recent study investigating the role of chromatin remodeling factors in transcriptional regulation, attention was focused on the protein complex yFACT and its influence on gene expression across varying cell cycles. The dynamics of yFACT interaction with nucleosomes were assessed through chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing (ChIP-seq), elucidating a preferential binding pattern during the S phase of the cell cycle. Intriguingly, pharmacological inhibition of DNA replication led to a diminished recruitment of yFACT to chromatin, suggesting a replication-coupled mechanism of action. Further biochemical assays revealed that exposure to oxidative stress, by the addition of hydrogen peroxide, altered the affinity of yFACT for modified histones, an observation that implicates yFACT in the cellular response to DNA damage. In conjunction with fluorescent microscopy, these findings provided insights into the spatial distribution of yFACT during reparative processes. While this work advances our understanding of the complexities of transcriptional regulation in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the implications for similar mechanisms in pathologies such as cancer remain to be determined, warranting additional investigations into targeted yFACT modulation as a potential therapeutic strategy.
