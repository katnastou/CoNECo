prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: endoSceI. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In a recent landmark study, the activity profile of the novel protein complex endoSceI was elucidated through a series of in vitro and in vivo experiments aimed at uncovering its therapeutic potential. The complex exhibited high specificity for selective cleavage of target sequences within the genomic DNA of *Escherichia coli*, pointing towards its possible application in precision genome editing techniques. The biochemical characterization involved a detailed assessment of endoSceI under various concentrations of divalent cations, notably magnesium and calcium, showcasing its dependence on these ionic cofactors for optimal activity. Furthermore, the kinetic parameters were measured, revealing a marked preference for ATP as an energy source, over other nucleotides. Remarkably, endoSceI demonstrated resilience against proteolytic degradation, thereby enhancing its stability and rendering it a viable candidate for sustained delivery in therapeutic contexts. While its use in treating genetic disorders remains speculative at this stage, the outcomes of this research pave the way for further exploration, especially into its role concerning repair mechanisms inherent in the cellular responses to DNA damage. The future implications of these findings might extend to targeted interventions in complex diseases, including certain forms of cancer, where genomic stability plays a pivotal role in pathogenesis.
