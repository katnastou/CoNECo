prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: cullin-RING ligase 2. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we explored the regulatory mechanisms by which the cullin-RING ligase 2 exerts its influence on cellular proliferation pathways. This ubiquitin ligase complex has been implicated in the targeted degradation of a subset of proteins, thereby maintaining homeostasis within the cell cycle. Various treatments were employed to modulate the activity of the complex, including the administration of small molecule inhibitors and the application of specific siRNAs. Subsequent analysis revealed that disruption of cullin-RING ligase 2 function led to an accumulation of substrates that are ordinarily ubiquitinated and earmarked for proteasomal degradation. This perturbation was correlated with a marked decrease in proliferation in carcinoma cell lines, whereas non-transformed cells exhibited a less pronounced response. These findings suggest that the cullin-RING ligase 2 plays a pivotal role in tumorigenesis, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target in proliferative disorders. The implications of these results extend to the development of cancer treatments, specifically those that could selectively inhibit the activity of this complex in malignant cells without adversely affecting the viability of normal tissues.
