prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: pVHL-elongin C-elongin B. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: Recent studies have provided significant insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying the regulation of hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs) by the pVHL-elongin C-elongin B complex. This multifaceted protein complex plays a crucial role in cellular oxygen sensing pathways and is integral to the proteasomal degradation of HIFs under normoxic conditions. Inhibition of the pVHL-elongin C-elongin B complex has been associated with the stabilization of HIFs, culminating in the transcriptional activation of genes implicated in angiogenesis, erythropoiesis, and glycolysis. Notably, the disruption of this complex has been implicated in the pathogenesis of clear cell renal carcinoma, underscoring its significance in both cellular physiology and disease etiology. Pharmacological targeting of this complex could potentially modulate the HIF pathway, suggesting a therapeutic strategy for diseases where aberrant HIF activity is a contributing factor. In our current research, we focus on the structural elucidation of the pVHL-elongin C-elongin B complex through cryo-electron microscopy, aiming to uncover the details of its interaction with HIF-1Î±. This will pave the way for the development of novel small-molecule inhibitors that can selectively disrupt this protein-protein interaction, offering a promising approach in cancer therapeutics.
