prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: RubisCO. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we investigate the kinetic parameters of RubisCO in response to varying concentrations of CO2 and O2 to elucidate its role in the Calvin-Benson cycle in the stroma of chloroplasts within *Arabidopsis thaliana*. Our analysis reveals that RubisCO shows higher carboxylation rates at increased CO2 levels, which correlate with an enhancement of photosynthetic efficiency and biomass accumulation. Conversely, elevated O2 levels lead to a competitive inhibition, underscoring the enzyme's dual specificity that profoundly affects photorespiration. Such findings are particularly relevant in the context of climate change, where shifts in atmospheric gas compositions could impact plant metabolism and crop yields. Additionally, we explored the impact of varying temperatures on RubisCO activity to better understand the thermal sensitivity of this enzyme, which might hold implications for the adaptation of plants to global temperature fluctuations. As such, RubisCO not only serves as a pivotal player in carbon fixation but also as a potential gauge for environmental stress, offering insights into the resilience of plant ecosystems in the face of anthropogenic changes.
