prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: DX2. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The recent discovery of the protein complex DX2 has provided novel insights into the mechanisms underlying neurodegenerative disorders. In a recent study, the functional implications of DX2 were examined in the context of neuroprotection and synaptic plasticity. Cultured hippocampal neurons treated with amyloid-beta oligomers demonstrated a marked decrease in DX2 levels, correlating with an increase in oxidative stress markers and synaptic dysfunction. Conversely, overexpression of DX2 in a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease resulted in a significant reduction in plaque burden and an improvement in cognitive performance, as assessed by a series of behavioral tests. The role of DX2 in modulating the activity of key signaling pathways, such as the MAPK/ERK and PI3K/Akt cascades, was confirmed using pharmacological inhibitors, suggesting that DX2 may act as an integrator of multiple neuroprotective signals. These findings position DX2 as a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases. However, further research is needed to fully understand the biogenesis, regulation, and broader physiological functions of DX2 within neural tissue and other organ systems in both diseased and homeostatic conditions.
