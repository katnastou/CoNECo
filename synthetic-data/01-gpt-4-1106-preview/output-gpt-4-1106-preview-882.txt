prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: HIR. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In the recent study we conducted, the role of the HIR protein complex in cellular response to DNA damage was investigated to elucidate its potential as a target for therapeutic interventions in cancer treatment. Cultured mammalian cells subjected to ionizing radiation displayed an increased concentration of HIR, suggesting a role in the DNA damage response cascade. Subsequent experiments utilizing chemical inhibitors specific to HIR indicated a reduction in the efficiency of DNA repair, leading to heightened levels of apoptosis in cancer cell lines. Interestingly, normal fibroblasts exhibited a less pronounced apoptotic response, hinting at a potential therapeutic window. The involvement of HIR in the regulation of cell cycle checkpoints was further supported through the use of flow cytometry, which revealed an accumulation of cells at the G1/S transition. The data implies that HIR may function as a regulatory nexus during the cellular defense against genotoxic stress, and its modulation could offer new avenues for the development of selective cancer treatments. Further exploration into the HIR-mediated pathways could unveil novel biomarkers for early detection of malignancies and contribute to the refinement of current oncological pharmacotherapy.
