prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: RES. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In an unprecedented study focusing on the elucidation of cellular mechanisms underpinning DNA repair processes, the protein complex known as RES has emerged as a critical player. This research, grounded in rigorous experimentation and an array of bioinformatics tools, delineates the pathway by which the RES complex is recruited to chromosomal sites experiencing double-strand breaks, a form of DNA damage that if left unchecked can lead to malignancies such as cancer. Utilizing model organisms, notably Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Mus musculus, the study reveals that cellular exposure to ionizing radiation triggers a cascade of signals resulting in the post-translational modification of RES, thereby modulating its DNA-binding affinity. Subsequent biochemical assays indicated that the complex plays an integral role in bridging the gap between DNA damage recognition and the recruitment of downstream repair machineries, thus contributing to genomic stability. The implications of these findings extend beyond basic cell biology, offering potential therapeutic insights for diseases characterized by genomic instability.
