prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: CRL7. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The cullin-RING ligase 7 (CRL7) complex is a pivotal component in the cellular proteostasis network, specifically implicated in ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis. Recent studies elucidate the role played by CRL7 in the targeted degradation of substrates that are involved in critical cellular processes such as cell cycle regulation and DNA damage response. In this context, the aberrant regulation of CRL7 activity has been observed to contribute to the pathophysiology of certain neoplastic conditions. Upon activation, CRL7 facilitates the polyubiquitination of key regulatory proteins, thereby marking them for proteasomal degradation. The selectivity of CRL7 for its substrates is of considerable interest, since it offers potential therapeutic intervention points. For instance, small molecule inhibitors that modulate the substrate-recognition capacity of CRL7 could provide a novel approach to stall the progression of particular malignancies. Interestingly, CRL7 has also been shown to interact with a variety of viral proteins, suggesting its manipulation by viral pathogens as a strategy to subvert host cellular mechanisms. As a potential pharmacological target, understanding the molecular architecture and regulatory networks of CRL7 is critical for the development of innovative treatments aimed at restoring normal cell function in the presence of disease-related perturbations.
