prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: arginine-specific carbamoyl phosphate synthetase. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In the recent study conducted by a multidisciplinary team, the catalytic efficiency of arginine-specific carbamoyl phosphate synthetase was analyzed to elucidate its role in the urea cycle. This enzyme is critical for the fixation of ammonia and the mediation of nitrogen disposal in the form of urea. Experimental procedures were performed to investigate the enzyme's activity in various conditions, with a particular focus on its kinetic parameters in the presence of its substrates, ATP, and glutamine. Results indicated that the arginine-specific carbamoyl phosphate synthetase displays a substantial rate of catalysis within the physiological pH range, thereby underscoring its importance in maintaining nitrogen homeostasis. Notably, in disorders such as hyperammonemia, the activity of this enzyme complex was found to be significantly hindered, leading to an accumulation of ammonia in the bloodstream. This accumulation can result in severe neurological deficits, demonstrating the critical nature of arginine-specific carbamoyl phosphate synthetase in pathological states. Future therapeutic interventions may benefit from modulating the function of this enzyme complex to alleviate symptoms associated with metabolic dysregulation.
