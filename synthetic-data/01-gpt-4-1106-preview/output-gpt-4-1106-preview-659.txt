prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: MutSgamma. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In a recent study, we investigated the role of MutSgamma in the context of DNA mismatch repair (MMR), a highly conserved mechanism critical for maintaining genomic stability. The experiments were conducted on cultured human fibroblasts subjected to DNA-damaging agents, such as N-Methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine (MNNG) and ultraviolet radiation (UV). Our results demonstrated that cells with proficient MutSgamma activity exhibited significantly fewer replication errors and a reduced frequency of mutation acquisition. This observation suggests that MutSgamma plays a pivotal role in the recognition and initiation of repair of base-base mismatches and insertion-deletion loops, which are commonplace after DNA replication mishaps. Moreover, the incidence of colorectal cancer in tissue samples, where MMR was compromised, highlights the importance of the MutSgamma complex in tumor suppression. The implications of this research are significant, providing potential new avenues for therapeutic interventions that may enhance the efficacy of MMR-targeted treatments and reduce the burden of diseases related to DNA replication errors.
