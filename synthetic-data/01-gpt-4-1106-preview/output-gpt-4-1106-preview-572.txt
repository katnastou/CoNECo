prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: Pex14. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we sought to elucidate the mechanistic role of Pex14 in peroxisomal biogenesis, specifically focusing on its interaction with membrane lipids and impact on cellular metabolism. Initially, we confirmed the subcellular localization of Pex14 using immunofluorescence microscopy, observing a punctate pattern consistent with peroxisomal matrices in both mouse and human fibroblast cell lines. Following this, we investigated the binding affinity of Pex14 for phospholipids through a series of in vitro lipid-binding assays, revealing a strong preference for certain anionic species, which suggests a potential role in the recruitment of peroxisomal membrane proteins. Further biochemical characterization involved monitoring the enzymatic activity of catalase, a peroxisomal marker enzyme, in the presence and absence of Pex14. It became evident that the dysfunction of Pex14 led to suboptimal catalase activity, indicating the integral role of Pex14 in maintaining peroxisomal functionality. These findings provide insights into the pathogenesis of Zellweger spectrum disorders, which are associated with peroxisomal abnormalities, and suggest that Pex14 might be a novel therapeutic target for ameliorating the biochemical defects observed in these diseases. Our data underscore the importance of Pex14 as a nexus for lipid-protein interactions within the peroxisome and as a critical factor for peroxisome homeostasis and metabolic health.
