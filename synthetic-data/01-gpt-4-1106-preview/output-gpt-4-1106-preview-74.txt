prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: PKS. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we aimed to elucidate the role of the protein complex PKS in the biosynthetic pathways of various secondary metabolites, uncovering its potential implications for the treatment of bacterial infections. Recent advancements in chromatography and mass spectrometry allowed for a detailed analysis of the metabolic output of strains expressing PKS. The findings suggest that this protein complex is instrumental in the synthesis of a broad spectrum of polyketides with notable antibiotic properties. Specifically, cultures of Streptomyces coelicolor that overexpressed PKS yielded an increased production of actinorhodin, a compound with well-established antimicrobial efficacy. Furthermore, the introduction of PKS into the model organism Escherichia coli facilitated the production of polyketides not typically found in its metabolic repertoire. This indicates a highly conserved function of PKS, which can be leveraged to engineer synthetic pathways in diverse hosts. The ability of PKS to catalyze key steps in these pathways makes it a prime target for the development of novel antimicrobial agents, potentially offering a therapeutic strategy to combat multi-drug-resistant bacterial strains which pose an increasing threat in the clinical landscape. Moving forward, the manipulation of PKS activity could also have significant applications in the field of applied microbiology, where the demand for new and more effective antibiotics continues to grow.
