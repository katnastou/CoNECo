prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: amyloid-beta protein 40/42. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: Recent investigations into the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) have elucidated the contributory role of the amyloid-beta protein 40/42 in neurodegeneration. Accumulation of the amyloid-beta protein 40/42 complex in the neural tissue leads to the formation of the characteristic amyloid plaques, which are considered a hallmark of AD. The neurotoxicity associated with these plaques is thought to arise from the oligomerization of the amyloid-beta protein 40/42, resulting in synaptic dysfunction and neuronal loss. In light of these findings, therapeutic strategies are being developed to target the clearance or inhibition of amyloid-beta protein 40/42 aggregation. Studies utilizing murine models have shown promising results with the administration of specific antibodies that recognize the conformational epitopes of the amyloid-beta protein 40/42 complex, thereby facilitating its removal by microglial cells. Moreover, efforts to modulate the activity of secretase enzymes in order to reduce the production of amyloid-beta protein 40/42 have also been pursued. The correlation between elevated levels of this protein complex and the severity of cognitive decline underscores its potential as a biomarker for early diagnosis and progression of AD. However, the exact mechanism by which amyloid-beta protein 40/42 mediates neurotoxicity remains to be fully elucidated, making it an imperative focus for ongoing research in the realm of neurodegenerative diseases.
