prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: NuMRP. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In a recent study, the regulatory role of the NuMRP complex in apoptotic pathways was investigated to elucidate its potential as a therapeutic target in the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The research employed various in vitro and in vivo models to assess the impact of altered NuMRP expression on apoptosis induction in response to chemotherapeutic agents. Initial experiments utilizing siRNA-mediated knockdown of NuMRP in NSCLC cell lines revealed a significant increase in sensitivity to cisplatin, indicating a possible resistance mechanism mediated by this protein complex. Subsequent analyses demonstrated that the loss of NuMRP function led to an augmentation in the intrinsic mitochondrial apoptotic pathway, as evidenced by increased cytochrome c release and caspase activation. Furthermore, NSCLC xenograft models treated with NuMRP inhibitors exhibited reduced tumor growth and an enhanced response to standard chemotherapy, highlighting the in vivo relevance of these findings. Collectively, these results suggest that NuMRP plays a crucial role in modulating apoptotic signaling in NSCLC cells, implicating its potential as a novel target for enhancing chemotherapeutic efficacy. Further studies are warranted to explore the mechanistic aspects of NuMRP's function and its interaction with additional molecular players in apoptosis-regulated pathways.
