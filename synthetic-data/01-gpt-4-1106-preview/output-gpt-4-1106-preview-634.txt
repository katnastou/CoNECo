prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: GlpABC. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In a recent study, the GlpABC protein complex has been implicated in the regulation of glycerol metabolism in response to oxidative stress in mammalian cells. The investigation, utilizing both in vitro and in vivo models, sought to delineate the mechanism underlying the cellular adaptation processes in the presence of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Notably, the study demonstrated that increased ROS levels resulted in the upregulation of GlpABC, which in turn modulated the metabolic flux through glycolytic pathways. Subsequent assays showed that the absence of GlpABC led to a marked decrease in cellular viability when cells were subjected to glycerol-supplemented conditions, indicating a protective role for this complex. Furthermore, pharmacological interventions that mimicked the action of GlpABC were found to confer resistance to oxidative damage in cell lines otherwise prone to stress-induced apoptosis, suggesting a potential therapeutic avenue for diseases characterized by metabolic and oxidative dysregulation. The research underscores the significance of GlpABC in maintaining cellular homeostasis and hints at a complex interplay between metabolic pathways and stress response mechanisms.
