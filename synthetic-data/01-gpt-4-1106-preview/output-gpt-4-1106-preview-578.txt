prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: APC/C. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In a recent investigation into cell cycle regulation, the anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C) has been identified as a pivotal ubiquitin ligase that orchestrates the temporally controlled degradation of key cell cycle regulators to ensure orderly progression through mitosis. This study aimed to elucidate the regulatory mechanisms underlying APC/C activation and substrate specificity. Utilizing HeLa cells, researchers applied small molecule inhibitors to perturb mitotic signaling pathways, subsequently assessing the impact on APC/C activity through immunoblotting techniques. Results indicated that the pristine coordination of APC/C with mitotic checkpoints is crucial for maintaining genomic stability, as dysregulation of APC/C activity led to the aberrant onset of anaphase and, ultimately, to an increased frequency of chromosome missegregationâ€”an event closely tied to tumorigenesis. The data suggest that targeting APC/C-mediated proteolysis may offer novel therapeutic avenues for the treatment of certain malignancies where cell cycle control is compromised. Notably, the study expanded on existing cancer models, integrating pharmacological agents that act on the spindle assembly checkpoint to further elucidate the complexity of APC/C regulation, paving the way for the development of targeted cancer therapies that could potentially minimize off-target effects and enhance the specificity of cell cycle intervention strategies.
