prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: ACF. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In a study aimed at elucidating the mechanisms underlying chromatin remodeling, we focused on the role of the ATP-dependent protein complex ACF in DNA repair processes. Upon exposure to genotoxic agents in cultured human fibroblasts, we observed a marked upregulation of ACF activity, as evidenced by enhanced ATPase functionality and mobilization on damaged chromatin foci. Interestingly, the application of the intercalating agent ethidium bromide resulted in a significant increase in ACF recruitment to chromatin, suggesting its direct involvement in addressing DNA perturbations. Further investigations using fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) demonstrated that the presence of ACF was critical for the restoration of chromatin architecture post UV-induced DNA damage. Additionally, our results suggest that the disruption of ACF's activity by specific inhibitors led to a pronounced sensitivity of cells to ionizing radiation, underscoring the complex's pivotal role in the maintenance of genomic integrity. These findings indicate that ACF plays a vital role in the cellular response to DNA lesions and may have implications for understanding the pathophysiology of diseases characterized by compromised DNA repair capacity, such as certain forms of cancer.
