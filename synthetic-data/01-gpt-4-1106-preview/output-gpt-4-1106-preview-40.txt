prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: protein phosphatase 4. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we aim to elucidate the regulatory functions of protein phosphatase 4 in the context of cellular stress responses. Previous research has established the relevance of this enzyme in modulating signaling pathways pivotal to maintaining cellular homeostasis, particularly during the onset of oxidative stress. Our investigations utilized a combination of in vitro enzymatic assays and in vivo murine models to assess the activity of protein phosphatase 4 following exposure to reactive oxygen species (ROS). We observed that cells exhibiting overexpression of protein phosphatase 4 demonstrated an enhanced capacity to mitigate DNA damage, as evidenced by a decrease in 8-oxoguanine lesions, a hallmark of oxidative stress. Moreover, our data suggest that the therapeutic modulation of protein phosphatase 4 activity holds potential for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases, where an imbalance in redox homeostasis plays a central role. The implications of these findings highlight the necessity for further detailed mapping of the signaling networks influenced by protein phosphatase 4 and their implications in disease pathogenesis and progression.
