prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: AMT1. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In a pivotal study examining the intricate pathways underlying nitrogen assimilation in mammals, the protein complex AMT1 has become a focal point of interest. The functional characterization of AMT1 has elucidated its critical role in the cellular uptake of ammonia, a compound pivotal for the synthesis of amino acids and nucleotides. Investigations utilizing targeted metabolomics have demonstrated a significant alteration in the metabolic profiles of murine models deficient in AMT1, specifically in the context of nitrogen-rich metabolic pathways. Furthermore, these models exhibited impaired renal function, suggesting a possible link between AMT1 activity and the maintenance of systemic nitrogen homeostasis. Immunohistochemical analyses have localized AMT1 to the membranes of key renal tubular epithelial cells, implicating it in the reabsorption processes essential for preventing hyperammonemiaâ€”a condition that leads to deleterious neurological outcomes if uncorrected. Thus, understanding the regulatory mechanisms governing AMT1 expression and function could potentially unveil new therapeutic targets for diseases characterized by nitrogen metabolism dysregulation.
