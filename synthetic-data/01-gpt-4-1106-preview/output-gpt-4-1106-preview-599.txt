prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: Adapter complex AP-2. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The endocytic pathway is an essential cellular process that dictates the internalization of plasma membrane proteins and lipids. A critical player in this pathway is the Adapter complex AP-2, which plays a pivotal role in the clathrin-mediated endocytosis of membrane-bound receptors. The mechanisms by which Adapter complex AP-2 recognizes cargo and initiates endocytosis have been the focus of intense research. Recent studies employing cryo-electron microscopy have revealed the intricate structural organization of this protein complex, shedding light on its ability to interact with phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate present in the cytoplasmic leaflet of the plasma membrane. Further experiments demonstrated the importance of tyrosine-based and dileucine-based motifs on the cargo molecules for the selective recognition by Adapter complex AP-2. Perturbations in the normal functioning of this complex have been linked to a variety of neurological disorders, indicating a critical role in maintaining cellular homeostasis. Investigations into small molecules that can modulate the activity of the complex are ongoing, with the intention of developing novel therapeutic strategies for conditions where the endocytic pathway is disrupted. The Adapter complex AP-2 is thus not only central to fundamental cell biology but also presents a potential target for pharmacological intervention in disease.
