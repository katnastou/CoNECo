prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: interleukin-28 receptor. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In the recent study published in the International Journal of Molecular Immunology, the interaction between the interleukin-28 receptor and its corresponding ligands was meticulously analyzed to delineate its role in the immune response during viral infections. Utilizing a murine model, the research provided novel insights into the mechanisms by which the interleukin-28 receptor modulates signaling pathways, ultimately influencing the production of antiviral proteins. The focus was particularly on hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection, where the receptor's activation appeared to correlate with a decrease in viral load and pathology. Furthermore, comparative analyses across different mammalian species, including humans, revealed a conserved function of the receptor, suggesting a fundamental role in the vertebrate immune system. Treatment groups receiving specific antagonists displayed an elevated viral propagation rate, underscoring the therapeutic potential of targeting this receptor in clinical settings. The study concluded that the interleukin-28 receptor might play a pivotal role in host defense, providing a framework for future pharmacological interventions designed to enhance viral clearance in affected patients.
