prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: alphav-beta5 integrin. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: Recent studies have elucidated the role of the alphav-beta5 integrin in the pathology of fibrotic diseases. Particularly, the expression and activation of this protein complex has been correlated with the progression of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), a chronic and often lethal interstitial lung disease. Immunohistological analyses of lung tissue samples from IPF patients demonstrated a marked upregulation of the alphav-beta5 integrin compared to that of healthy controls. Furthermore, in vitro assays using human fibroblast cultures treated with the profibrotic cytokine, transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β), revealed that the inhibition of the alphav-beta5 integrin reduced the TGF-β-induced expression of extracellular matrix components such as collagen and fibronectin. These findings suggest a potential therapeutic target in the alphav-beta5 integrin, which may lead to the development of novel antifibrotic compounds aiming to mitigate the pathological remodeling of lung tissue. Future research is set to focus on identifying small molecule inhibitors that specifically target this protein complex, thereby preventing the activation of downstream signaling pathways implicated in the exacerbation of fibrotic processes.
