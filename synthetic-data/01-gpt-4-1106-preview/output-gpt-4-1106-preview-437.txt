prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: cullin. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we have investigated the mechanistic role of the cullin protein complex in the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway, a critical system for protein degradation and homeostasis within eukaryotic cells. Dysregulation of this pathway has been implicated in the pathogenesis of a broad range of diseases, including neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease, and various forms of cancer. Our experiments utilized murine models and primary neuronal cultures to elucidate the impact of cullin-mediated proteolysis on cellular health. Treatment with the proteasome inhibitor MG132 allowed for the accumulation of ubiquitylated proteins, thereby demonstrating the pivotal role of the cullin complex in tagging substrates for degradation. Furthermore, we observed an increase in oxidative stress and apoptotic markers following MG132 treatment, suggesting that the cullin complex may also play a protective role against cell death induced by proteotoxic stress. These findings provide new insights into the potential therapeutic targeting of the ubiquitin-proteasome system in disease states marked by protein aggregation and cellular dysfunction.
