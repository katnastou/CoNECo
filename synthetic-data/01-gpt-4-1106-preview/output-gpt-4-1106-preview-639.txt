prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: transforming growth factor beta1-type II receptor-type I receptor. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we investigated the signaling cascade initiated by the transforming growth factor beta1-type II receptor-type I receptor complex in the context of fibrotic disease progression. The action of the transforming growth factor beta1-type II receptor-type I receptor is key in the regulation of cellular proliferation, differentiation, and extracellular matrix production. This complex operates within a carefully orchestrated pathway, typically activated when ligands bind to its extracellular domain. Upon ligand-induced activation, the transforming growth factor beta1-type II receptor-type I receptor phosphorylates downstream effectors, including SMAD proteins, ultimately leading to changes in gene expression. Dysregulation of this pathway has been observed in pathological states, such as in the livers of patients with cirrhosis. In our investigations, human hepatic stellate cells exposed to a high-glucose environment illustrated an upregulation in the activation of the transforming growth factor beta1-type II receptor-type I receptor, suggesting a potential link between hyperglycemia and enhanced fibrogenic signaling. This research adds to the growing body of evidence indicating that an aberrant transforming growth factor beta1-type II receptor-type I receptor signaling axis may contribute to the persistence and exacerbation of tissue fibrosis, opening new avenues for therapeutic intervention in fibrotic diseases.
