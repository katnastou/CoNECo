prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: BCKDHC. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: The biochemical role of the BCKDHC in metabolic pathways has become increasingly clear as its involvement in the catabolic process of branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs) such as leucine, isoleucine, and valine has been elucidated. BCKDHCâ€™s activity is paramount in the regulation of energy homeostasis and amino acid balance within human physiology. Disruption in the functionality of this complex has been correlated with severe metabolic disorders, including Maple Syrup Urine Disease (MSUD), highlighting the critical nature of its precise regulation. In current studies, patient-derived fibroblasts have been utilized to investigate the pathophysiological impacts of mutations within BCKDHC, revealing novel insights into the complex's regulatory mechanisms. To this end, treatment approaches, such as dietary management with specific nutrient compositions and pharmacological interventions targeting metabolic pathways, are being evaluated to ameliorate the symptoms associated with BCKDHC dysfunction. The potential therapeutic role of small molecule enhancers of BCKDHC activity presents a promising avenue for research, aiming to restore the metabolic balance in affected individuals, thereby improving their clinical outcomes.
