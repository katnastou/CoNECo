prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: Cut1-2. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In a recent study, we endeavored to elucidate the mechanistic role of Cut1-2, a novel protein complex implicated in cellular division and homeostasis. This investigation involved a series of in vitro experiments using murine models, as well as an array of biochemical assays designed to dissect the functional contributions of Cut1-2 at the molecular level. Our results indicate that Cut1-2 plays a pivotal role in the transition from the G2 phase to mitosis, which is crucial for maintaining genomic stability. Importantly, dysregulation of this complex has been correlated with heightened susceptibility to oncogenic transformations. By treating cell cultures with a panel of kinase inhibitors, we provided evidence that Cut1-2 functions downstream of the ATM signaling pathway, a key regulator in the cellular response to DNA damage. Chronic exposure to oxidative stress seemed to diminish the protein complex's activity, suggesting an intrinsic sensitivity to reactive oxygen species. The findings have profound implications for developing therapeutic strategies targeting Cut1-2's activity to mitigate disease progression in conditions where cellular division is compromised, such as in certain cancer types.
