prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: IL-10 receptor. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In this study, we investigate the immunomodulatory role of the IL-10 receptor in the context of inflammatory responses to bacterial infections. Upon infection with Staphylococcus aureus, a marked upregulation of cytokine expression was observed in murine macrophages. Notably, when macrophages were treated with a neutralizing antibody against the IL-10 receptor, there was a substantial augmentation of pro-inflammatory markers, indicating that the interaction between IL-10 and its receptor serves as a critical regulatory axis to temper the host immune response. Furthermore, in vivo experiments using a mouse model of sepsis revealed that the blockade of the IL-10 receptor led to a more severe disease phenotype, including heightened levels of systemic inflammation and increased mortality. These findings suggest that the IL-10 receptor plays a pivotal role in mitigating the pathological consequences of septic shock by orchestrating a controlled immune response. The therapeutic potential of modulating the IL-10 receptor signaling pathway may offer novel approaches to treat sepsis with a fine-tuned balance between adequate bacterial clearance and prevention of excessive tissue damage.
