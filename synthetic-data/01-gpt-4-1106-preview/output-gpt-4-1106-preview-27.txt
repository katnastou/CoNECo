prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: nucleotide-excision repair factor 1. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In the pursuit of elucidating the mechanisms that underpin cellular responses to DNA damage, considerable attention has been directed towards the elucidation of nucleotide-excision repair factor 1 function. Recent investigations have demonstrated that this protein complex plays a pivotal role in the recognition and repair of a wide array of DNA lesions, prompted primarily by ultraviolet (UV) radiation and various chemical mutagens. Through meticulously designed in vitro studies, it has been observed that the activity of nucleotide-excision repair factor 1 is not only crucial for maintaining genomic integrity in human cells, but its function also correlates with the cellular resistance to the cytotoxic effects of UV radiation. Furthermore, the deficiency of this protein complex has been associated with a heightened susceptibility to skin carcinomas, underlining its significance in cancer prevention. Insights gained from advanced chromatin immunoprecipitation assays suggest a dynamic recruitment of nucleotide-excision repair factor 1 to DNA damage sites, signifying its essentiality in the initial damage recognition phase of the nucleotide excision repair pathway. The temporal orchestration of nucleotide-excision repair factor 1 within the repair cascade offers a promising therapeutic target, aiming to enhance the efficacy of treatments for diseases rooted in DNA repair defects.
