prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: RFC. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In the recent study investigating DNA replication mechanisms, emphasis was placed on the regulatory role of RFC in this vital cellular process. RFC, a pivotal protein complex involved in the orchestration of DNA synthesis, was analyzed in the context of its interaction with various replication-associated factors. The experimental approach employed an array of biochemical assays to assess RFC function under different cellular conditions, including the presence of oxidative stress induced by chemical agents such as hydrogen peroxide. Additionally, eukaryotic cells in various stages of the cell cycle were employed to determine the integrity and fidelity of the DNA replication process in which RFC is involved. Notably, the research revealed a substantial decrease in replication efficiency in cells subjected to genotoxic stress, underscoring the significance of RFC in maintaining genomic stability. Moreover, this study drew correlations between impaired RFC activity and the onset of replication-related diseases, suggesting a potential therapeutic target for conditions characterized by genomic instability. In conclusion, the findings underscore the critical nature of RFC in safeguarding the cell's genetic blueprint and highlight the complex interplay between protein complexes and cellular homeostasis.
