prompt: Write a paragraph of text in the style of a biomedical research article. Include the following protein complex name: EBI3. Use this name exactly as provided, avoiding any synonyms, aliases, abbreviated or expanded forms. Also avoid including any other names referring to a gene, protein, protein complex, protein part or component, or any other molecular entity containing amino acid residues. The text can include mentions of other biomedical entity types, such as chemical, organism, and disease names.
output: In the recent study conducted by Doe et al. (2023), the immunoregulatory role of EBI3 in the context of inflammatory responses was elucidated. Upon stimulation by specific cytokines, EBI3 was found to be upregulated in a subset of regulatory T cells isolated from murine models of autoimmune encephalomyelitis, an experimental proxy for human multiple sclerosis. Detailed in vitro analysis revealed that the presence of EBI3 is critical for the suppression of proinflammatory cytokine secretion, suggesting a pivotal role in maintaining immune homeostasis. Further in vivo experiments involved the administration of a monoclonal antibody targeting EBI3, which resulted in the exacerbation of disease symptoms and increased infiltration of immune cells into the central nervous system. Notably, these findings were corroborated through parallel studies in other organisms, indicating a conserved function of EBI3 across species. The therapeutic potential of modulating EBI3 activity in diseases characterized by chronic inflammation has opened new avenues for pharmacological intervention, underscoring the importance of understanding the underlying molecular mechanisms that govern immune regulation. These insights contribute substantially to the field of immunology, paving the way for novel treatment strategies aimed at combating immune-mediated disorders.
