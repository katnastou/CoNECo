For localization studies, microtubules stabilized with 1.5 muM taxol were incubated for 10 min at room temperature with 100 nM MBP-xMCRS1, KANSL1 or KANSL3, as indicated, in BRB80. Samples were then fixed with 1% glutaraldehyde, 5 muM taxol in BRB80 and pelleted on coverslips through a 25% glycerol, BRB80 cushion at 4,000g for 10 min at room temperature. Coverslips were then recovered and fixed for 10 min in -20 degreesC methanol and processed for immunofluorescence.
