SUMO-dependent regulation of centrin-2.  Centrins are multifunctional Ca(2+)-binding proteins that are highly conserved from yeast to humans. Centrin-2 is a core component of the centrosome of higher eukaryotes. In addition, it is present within the nucleus, in which it is part of the xeroderma pigmentosum group C (XPC) complex, which controls nucleotide excision repair (NER). Regulation of the subcellular distribution of centrin-2 has so far remained elusive. Here we show that centrin-2 is a substrate of SUMOylation in vitro and in vivo, and that it is preferentially modified by SUMO2/3. Moreover, we identify the SUMO E3-like ligase human polycomb protein 2 (PC2; also known as hPC2) as essential for centrin-2 modification. Interference with the SUMOylation pathway leads to a striking defect in nuclear localization of centrin-2 and accumulation in the cytoplasm, whereas centrosomal recruitment of centrin-2 is unaffected. Depletion of the XPC protein mimics this situation and we provide evidence that SUMO conjugation of centrin-2 enhances its binding to the XPC protein. These data show that the nucleocytoplasmic shuttling of centrin-2 depends on the SUMO system and indicates that localization of centrin-2 within the nucleus depends on its ability to bind to the XPC protein.
