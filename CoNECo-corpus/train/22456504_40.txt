Likewise, a mild effect of hypertubulation on recycling was observed for the three cargoes: on cPLA2alpha depletion, recycling of Tac-GPI, CD59 (unpublished data), and Tac (both believed to reside within cholesterol-containing endosomes) was moderately delayed, whereas Tac-LL recycling remained unaffected (Figure 4). This delay was more evident for Tac-GPI at short treatments with MAFP and BAPTA-AM, compared with the other two Tac cargoes. Whereas activation of cPLA2alpha with melittin resulted in vast vesicular distribution of CD59, it did not alter its transport back to the plasma membrane, nor did it do so for the other two Tac cargoes. Although vesicles laden with cargo might conceivably be more easily transported along microtubules to the cell surface compared with cargo associated with tubular membranes, motor proteins may be the limiting step, controlling the rate of vesicles that recycle. We speculate that the modest inhibition observed in recycling under conditions of hypertubulation could result from cargo shunting to an alternative route of recycling (fast recycling), occurring directly from peripheral endosomes partly bypassing the tubular recycling compartment.
