C1D and hMtr4p co-localize with PM/Scl-100 in the nucleoli of HEp-2 cells. (A) HEp-2 cells were transiently transfected with cDNA constructs encoding EGFP alone, EGFP-PM/Scl-75, EGFP-MPP6, EGFP-C1D or EGFP-hMtr4p. Twenty-four hours after transfection, the cells were fixed and EGFP or EGFP-fusion proteins were visualized by confocal fluorescence microscopy. (B) HEp-2 cells were transfected with cDNA constructs encoding C1D and hMtr4p fused to the C-terminus of EGFP; 24 h after transfection, cells were fixed and incubated with rabbit anti-PM/Scl-100 antibodies, which were visualized by Texas-Red-conjugated secondary antibodies (left panels). The localization of EGFP-tagged C1D and hMtr4p is shown in the middle panels, and the corresponding merged images are shown on the right.
