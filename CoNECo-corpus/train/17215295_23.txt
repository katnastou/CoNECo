Deficient NER in tfb5 deletion mutant extracts. In vitro NER was performed in yeast cell-free extracts (250 mug of extract protein) of the wild-type strain (WT) (lane 1), the rad14 deletion mutant strain (lane 2), or the tfb5 deletion mutant strain (lane 3). Another in vitro NER assay was performed in a mixture of the rad14 and tfb5 mutant extracts (125 mug each) (lane 4). +AAF, AAF-damaged pUC18 DNA; -AAF, undamaged pGEM3Zf DNA as the internal control. Upper panel, ethidium bromide-stained gel; lower panel, autoradiograph of the gel.
