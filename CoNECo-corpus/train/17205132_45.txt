Phospho-specific antibody against Thr286 of cyclin D1 was raised using KLH-conjugated phospho-peptide KDLAC-pT-PTDVR as an antigen in collaboration with Zymed Inc. Rabbits were immunized three times with the peptides and serum was collected after 3 months, and subjected to affinity-purification using affinity gel coupled with phosphorylated peptide. Anti-nonphosphorylated cyclin D1 antibodies were eliminated by affinity-absorption using gel coupled with unphosphorylated peptide (Zymed).
