We used a structural genomics approach to human START domain containing proteins. Based on previously published crystal structures multiple expression constructs were designed for STARD1, STARD5, STARD7-11, STARD13 and STARD14. Following recombinant protein production in E. coli, well-diffracting crystals were obtained for the START domains of STARD1, STARD5, STARD13 and STARD14 (Table 2). Their crystal structures were solved and refined to between 2.0 and 3.4 Aa resolution (Table 3).
