In S. cerevisiae, Pex11p was shown to homodimerize via the Cys-3 residue, and mutation of this residue to alanine inhibited dimerization, causing numerous and small peroxisomes. The study suggested the monomeric form to be the active species. However, P. pastoris Pex11p lacks cysteine residues in its protein sequence. Therefore, an alternate mechanism for activation of Pex11p to induce division is necessary. Here we suggest a phosphorylation-mediated activation of Pex11p for division.
