TREM-1 ligand expression on platelets enhances neutrophil activation.  
The triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 1 (TREM-1) plays an important role in the innate immune response related to severe infections and sepsis. Modulation of TREM-1-associated activation improves the outcome in rodent models for pneumonia and sepsis. However, the identity and occurrence of the natural TREM-1 ligands are so far unknown, impairing the further understanding of the biology of this receptor. Here, we report the presence of a ligand for TREM-1 on human platelets. Using a recombinant TREM-1 fusion protein, we demonstrate specific binding of TREM-1 to platelets. TREM-1-specific signals are required for the platelet-induced augmentation of polymorphonuclear leukocyte (PMN) effector functions (provoked by LPS). However, TREM-1 interaction with its ligand is not required for platelet/PMN complex formation, which is dependent on integrins and selectins. Taken together, the results indicate that the TREM-1 ligand is expressed by platelets, and the TREM-1/ligand interaction contributes to the amplification of LPS-induced PMN activation. Our results shed new light on our understanding of TREM-1 and its role in the innate inflammatory response in infections and might contribute to the development of future concepts to treat sepsis.
