To determine whether acylation is important for Vac8p function, the phenotypic consequences of the acylation-minus mutants were examined. Strikingly, whereas vac8-2 showed normal vacuole inheritance and morphology (Fig. 7 A, a), the vacuole inheritance and morphology in vac8-3 were identical to those in Deltavac8 cells (b). Thus, palmitoylation is required for Vac8p function in vacuole inheritance, whereas myristoylation is dispensable. When vac8-2 or vac8-3 were labeled with FM4-64 and mated with Deltavac8, only 9% of the zygotic buds inherited vacuoles from vac8-3 parental vacuoles, compared with 89% from vac8-2 parental vacuoles (Table II). This further confirms the importance of palmitoylation but not myristoylation for Vac8p function in vacuole inheritance. Because almost equal amounts of Vac8p are present in the membrane fraction of the two mutants, the vacuole inheritance defect in the palmitoylation-minus mutant is unlikely to be due to the mislocalization of Vac8p from the vacuolar membrane; rather, the palmitate group may somehow participate more directly in the vacuole segregation process.
