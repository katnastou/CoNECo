We also tested the influence of a set of mutations in the DEP domain on its association of Dvl2(417-588) with mu2C and with intact AP-2, purified from bovine brain (Fig. 6). Because the DEP-mu2 contact is weak, we chose to use as bait in the pull-down assay the Dvl2 fragment (417-588) containing both the DEP domain and the tyrosine motif. We therefore were testing for modulations in apparent affinity, rather than all-or-none effects. Mutating the tyrosine residue of YHEL results in a substantial loss of binding as expected. Single polar amino-acid changes (Asp441Lys, Asn451Ala, Arg489Ala) reduced affinity; double or triple mutation did not produce a further decrease (Fig. 6). We conclude that even the single substitutions in the DEP domain fully destabilize the DEP:mu2 interface, and further changes do not affect the basal affinity determined by the tyrosine motif.
