The consistent observation of a 2:1 stoichiometry for PNK-FHA-binding to all the peptides tested, other than that phosphorylated on Thr523 only, was surprising. To determine if this was related to the use of the isolated FHA domain, we repeated the titrations with full-length human PNK, against the pSer518/pThr519, and pSer518/pThr519/pThr523/pSer525 peptides. The measured affinities for these peptides (Kd = 1.57 microM and 0.10 microM, respectively) were comparable to those obtained with the isolated FHA domains, and the stoichiometries obtained for the full-length proteins (N = 0.61 and 0.49) were similarly consistent with formation of 2:1 complexes with the peptide in both cases (Figure 2C). Finally we inverted the ITC experiment from the normal arrangement with the protein in the cell and the peptide injected. When PNK-FHA was injected into the cell containing the pSer518/pThr519 peptide, the measured affinity (Kd = 2.23 microM) was comparable to that obtained in the inverted experiment, with the measured stoichiometry (N = 1.76) inverted, but fully consistent with formation of a 2:1 protein-peptide complex (Figure 2D).
