Breast cancer E0771 and MCF-7 tumor cells transfected with Lenti-SALL1, Lenti-mSALL1 or vector, were plated in 6-well plates and grown to confluence. A wound area was generated by scraping cells with a 200 mul pipette tip across the entire diameter of the dish and extensively rinsed with the medium to remove all cellular debris. Low-serum RPMI 1640 with mitomycin (2 mug/ml) was then added to inhibit cell proliferation during the experiment and the closing of the wound was observed at different time points.
