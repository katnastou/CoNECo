Recent comparative analysis of insect genomes have identified putative SBP2 proteins. In this work we set out to clone and characterize dSBP2 and compare it to hSBP2. tBlastn searches were performed at NCBI using the hSBP2 amino acid sequence and one significant hit (AI062219) was obtained with a D. melanogaster sequence predicted to encode a 313 amino-acid protein. Figure 1 shows a multiple sequence alignment of this protein as well as other putative SBP2 from D. pseudoobscura and D. sechelia with the characterized rat and human SBP2 and the annotated chicken and Sus scrofa SBP2s. Strikingly, the three putative Drosophila SBP2s lack homology to the vertebrate SBP2 N-terminal region. Homologies to vertebrate SBP2s were found throughout the rest of the sequence, starting from hSBP2 residue 427. Two blocks of high sequence identity were detected, one extending from K517 to K544, the other from I624 to K774 (hSBP2 numbering), with 50% and 36% identity, respectively. The latter block contains the previously identified L7Ae RNA-binding module spanning residues R672 to I749.
