We next asked whether other arboviruses also depend on the same OST complexes and used flow cytometry to determine whether infection was impaired in STT3A or STT3B knockout cells. We infected cells with DENV serotype 2 (DENV-2), Zika virus (ZIKV), West Nile virus (WNV), yellow fever virus (YFV), Sindbis virus (SINV), Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus (VEEV), or Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) and compared the percentage of infected cells in OST knockout cells compared to that in the control cells. Consistent with our other results, we found that DENV-2 infection was dramatically reduced in OST knockout cells compared to control cells (Fig. S1). We also found that ZIKV infection was moderately, but significantly, reduced in STT3A and STT3B knockout cells, indicating that the OSTs may also play a role during ZIKV infection (Fig. S1). However, we did not find a significant decrease in the propagation of the other viruses tested.
