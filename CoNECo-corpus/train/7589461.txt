Stimulation of cloned human glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor expressed in HEK 293 cells induces cAMP-dependent activation of calcium-induced calcium release.  
The actions of glucagon-like peptide-1(7-36)amide (GLP-1(7-36)amide) on cellular signalling were studied in human embryonal kidney 293 (HEK 293) cells stably transfected with the cloned human GLP-1 receptor. The cloned GLP-1 receptor showed a single high-affinity binding site (Kd = 0.76 nM). Binding of GLP-1(7-36)amide stimulated cAMP production in a dose-dependent manner (EC50 = 0.015 nM) and caused an increase in the intracellular free Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i). The latter effect reflected Ca(2+)-induced Ca2+ release and was suppressed by ryanodine. We propose that the ability of GLP-1(7-36)amide to increase [Ca2+]i results from sensitization of the ryanodine receptors by a protein kinase A dependent mechanism.
