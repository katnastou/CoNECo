Avian DT40 cells in which endogenous IP3R genes are disrupted (DT40-KO cells) or the same cells stably expressing rat IP3R1 (DT40-IP3R1) were used to determine the contribution of IP3R to SOCE in cells from vertebrates. DT40 cells (107 cells/ml) were loaded with fluo-4 by incubation at 20degreesC with fluo-4 AM (2 microM) in HBS containing BSA (1 mg/ml) and Pluronic F-127 (0.02% w/v) [HBS in mM: NaCl (135), KCl (5.8), MgCl2 (1.2), CaCl2 (1.5), HEPES (11.6), d-glucose (11.5) pH 7.3]. After 60 min, cells were centrifuged (650 g, 2 min), re-suspended in HBS (5x106 cells/ml) and distributed (50 microl/well) into poly-l-lysine-coated half-area 96-well plates. After centrifugation (300 g, 2 min) fluorescence (excitation 485 nm, emission 525 nm) was recorded at 1.44-s intervals at 20degreesC in a FlexStation 3 plate-reader. Fluorescence signals (F) were calibrated to [Ca2+]c from: where, Fmin and Fmax are the fluorescence values determined in parallel wells by addition of Triton X-100 (0.1% w/v) and either BAPTA (10 mM) for Fmin, or CaCl2 (10 mM) for Fmax, and KDCa=345 nM.
