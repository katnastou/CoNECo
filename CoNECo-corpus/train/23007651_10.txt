We also tested the de novo folding of the individual mtHsp70 domains. To mimic the two-domain structure of full-length mtHsp70, the individual domains were analyzed in the context of dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) fusion proteins, from now on referred to as PBD-DHFR and ATPase-DHFR, respectively, in which the PBD and the ATPase domain were each fused with an 80-aa-residue-long spacer to the mouse DHFR. Trypsin treatment of imported PBD-DHFR generated two protease-resistant fragments, corresponding to the PBD and the DHFR domain (Fig. 1 B). The kinetics of import of PBD-DHFR and of the formation of the protease-resistant fragments were very similar, indicating that the PBD-DHFR folds immediately after its import into the mitochondrial matrix. In the case of the ATPase-DHFR construct, the DHFR domain was protease resistant, but the ATPase domain was almost completely protease sensitive (Fig. 1 C). Thus, the ATPase domain does not fold properly in the context of the DHFR fusion protein. On the contrary, the PBD folds independently of the ATPase domain.
