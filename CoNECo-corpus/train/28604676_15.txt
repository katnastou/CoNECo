To assess whether ACAT2 stability is regulated by cellular redox, we treated cells with prooxidants menadione or H2O2 and found that both oxidative reagents markedly stabilized ACAT2 (Fig. 4d and Supplementary Fig. 5a). In addition, siRNA depletion of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD), a key enzyme in synthesizing the main intracellular reductant NADPH, also resulted in ACAT2 stabilization (Fig. 4e), in agreement with the notion that G6PD deficiency sensitizes cells to oxidative stress. Furthermore, menadione or H2O2 dramatically lessened ACAT2 ubiquitination (Fig. 4f and Supplementary Fig. 5b), whereas the antioxidant N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC) attenuated lipid-induced stabilization of ACAT2 (Fig. 4g).
