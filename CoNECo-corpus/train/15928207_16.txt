The multicopy plasmid YEp13 containing the INP1 gene was introduced into wild-type cells synthesizing Pot1p-GFP to determine the effects of INP1 overexpression on the peroxisome phenotype. Overexpression of INP1 in cells incubated in oleic acid medium led to the preferential localization of peroxisomes to the cortical regions of cells (Fig. 2 C), as shown by the analysis of individual optical sections in a z-stack. In addition, overexpression of INP1 led to an apparent irregularity in the distribution of peroxisomes between mother cells and buds, with a significant number of buds not containing any readily evident fluorescent peroxisomes.
