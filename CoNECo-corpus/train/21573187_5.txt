In budding yeast genetic screens identified SPC97 (spindle pole body component of 97 kDa) and SPC98 as interacting partners of the gamma-tubulin TUB4 . Spc97, Spc98 and Tub4 constitute the core set of the yeast gamma-TuSC (known as the Tub4 complex). The Tub4 complex was later found to be a Y-shaped heterotetramer composed of one molecule of Spc97 and Spc98 and two molecules of Tub4. Subsequently, homologues of Spc97 and Spc98 were identified in various organisms such as fission yeast, insects, humans and plants.
