Studies suggest that the proteins with distinct roles at the ER and NPC are specifically involved in NPC biogenesis and structure. In metazoans, NPC biogenesis occurs by way of two processes: postmitotic assembly and interphase de novo assembly. The stepwise progression of postmitotic NPC assembly is well defined. After mitosis, sites of NPC assembly are seeded by the ELYS/Nup107 complex on the chromatin. Integral pore membrane proteins (Poms) of the NPC are recruited as the NE reforms from the cortical ER, stabilizing a pore into which other Nups assemble. During de novo assembly, the intact double membrane of the NE must fuse to allow the formation of a nascent pore. Ndc1 is the only Pom known to be individually essential for this process. Owing to functional redundancies among other Poms, the mechanistic steps of this fusion event have been difficult to define further.
