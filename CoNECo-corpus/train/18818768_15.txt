In yeast, the cytosolic kinase Sky1 phosphorylates the SP motif closest to the C-terminus of Npl3 (S411). Phosphorylation of Npl3 at S411 in a sky1 deletion strain is reduced, but not abolished (data not shown), raising the possibility that another Npl3-specific kinase remained to be identified, and that other phosphorylation sites in Npl3 might exist. To ascertain the later possibility, endogenous Npl3 was immunoprecipitated from whole cell extracts and phosphorylation sites were analyzed by mass spectrometry. Multiple phosphorylation sites were identified in the endogenous Npl3 ( Table 1 ). Our results confirmed phosphorylation of serine 224, 349 and 356, which where identified previously in two large-scale phosphorylation analyses. One new additional site was shown to be phosphorylated, serine 212. This data is summarized in Table 1 .
