The Sam3 mutations that confer sinefungin-resistance also result in loss-of-function in AdoMet uptake, as gauged by impaired growth on AdoMet-containing B medium. Most of the sfr mutants isolated in the screen are functionally null for Sam3 because of premature translation stops that remove three or more of the 12 predicted membrane-spanning segments. The Sam3 missense mutations that confer sinefungin-resistance are Q126P, S171R, E213K, and S476F. Gln126, Ser171 and Ser476 are located in predicted membrane spanning segments 2, 3 and 11, respectively. Glu213 is situated between the third and fourth membrane-spanning segments. All four of these Sam3 side chains are conserved in the yeast Mmp1 permease that transports S-methylmethionine.
