The export of mRNA to the cytoplasm through NPCs is mediated by the Mex67:Mtr2 heterodimer in yeast and NXF1:NXT1 (TAP:P15) in metazoans. Mex67:Mtr2 is recruited to mRNA during transcription and processing via proteins, including Yra1 and Sub2. Once associated with the mRNP, Mex67:Mtr2 interacts with the phenylalanine-glycine (FG) repeats present in many nuclear pore proteins (nucleoporins) to facilitate transport through NPCs. Studies in yeast and mammals show that Yra1 and Sub2 are part of the multisubunit TREX (TRanscription and EXport) complex, which also contains components (THO) involved in transcription elongation.
