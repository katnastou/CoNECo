Transforming growth factor-beta stimulates p300-dependent RUNX3 acetylation, which inhibits ubiquitination-mediated degradation.  The Runt domain transcription factors (RUNXs) play essential roles in normal development and neoplasias. Genetic analyses of animals and humans have revealed the involvement of RUNX1 in hematopoiesis and leukemia, RUNX2 in osteogenesis and cleidocranial dysplasia, and RUNX3 in the development of T-cells and dorsal root ganglion neurons and in the genesis of gastric cancer. Here we report that RUNX3 is a target of the acetyltransferase activity of p300. The p300-dependent acetylation of three lysine residues protects RUNX3 from ubiquitin ligase Smurf-mediated degradation. The extent of the acetylation is up-regulated by the transforming growth factor-beta signaling pathway and down-regulated by histone deacetylase activities. Our findings demonstrate that the level of RUNX3 protein is controlled by the competitive acetylation and deacetylation of the three lysine residues, revealing a new mechanism for the posttranslational regulation of RUNX3 expression.
