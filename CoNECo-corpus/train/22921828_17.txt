Similar to the pathogen protein EspFU, the identified cellular ligands of IRTKS/IRSp53 SH3, namely Shank 1-3 and Eps8 also contain a tandem PxxP motif. However, a pathogen protein would be expected to have a higher SH3 binding affinity to displace cellular ligands in order to hijack IRTKS/IRSp53-mediated signaling pathways of the host cell. To test this assumption we compared the binding affinities obtained using NMR CSP (chemical shift perturbation) mapping and ITC of EspFU R475 and a 20-residue peptide derived from Eps8 containing the tandem PxxP IRTKS recognition motif (see Table 3). The CSP mapping showed that these peptides bound to the same binding site on IRTKS SH3 as peptide addition induced chemical shift changes for the same set of NH correlations in the 15N-HSQC spectrum of 15N-labeled IRTKS SH3 (Fig. 3, upper panels). However, the binding affinities were different. EspFU was clearly a strong binder as two sets of peaks were observed in subequimolar concentrations, while CSPs observed for the Eps8 peptide were in the regime of intermediate exchange in the NMR timescale, indicating lower affinity. In agreement with CSP, we obtained dissociation constants Kd (EspFU) = 0.5 muM vs. Kd (Eps8) = 30.5 muM, using ITC. These data showed that the pathogenic EspFU is able to usurp this host cell signaling pathway by superseding the cellular ligand with approximately 60 times higher affinity against its target.
