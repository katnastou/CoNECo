Interaction of the DF3/MUC1 breast carcinoma-associated antigen and beta-catenin in cell adhesion. 
The DF3/MUC1 mucin-like glycoprotein is aberrantly overexpressed in human breast carcinomas. The functional role of DF3 is unknown. The present studies demonstrate that DF3 associates with beta-catenin. Similar findings have been obtained for gamma-catenin but not alpha-catenin. DF3, like E-cadherin and the adenomatous polyposis coli gene product, contains an SXXXXXSSL site that is responsible for direct binding to beta-catenin. The results further demonstrate that interaction of DF3 and beta-catenin is dependent on cell adhesion. These findings and the role of beta-catenin in cell signaling support a role for DF3 in the adhesion of epithelial cells.
