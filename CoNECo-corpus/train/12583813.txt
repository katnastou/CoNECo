Differential interaction of the tyrosine phosphatases PTP-SL, STEP and HePTP with the mitogen-activated protein kinases ERK1/2 and p38alpha is determined by a kinase specificity sequence and influenced by reducing agents.  
The protein tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs) PTP-SL, STEP and HePTP are mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) substrates and regulators that bind to MAPKs through a kinase-interaction motif (KIM) located in their non-catalytic regulatory domains. We have found that the binding of these PTPs to the MAPKs extracellular-signal-regulated kinase 1 and 2 (ERK1/2), and p38alpha is differentially determined by the KIM-adjacent C-terminal regions of the PTPs, which have been termed kinase-specificity sequences, and is influenced by reducing agents. Under control conditions, PTP-SL bound preferentially to ERK1/2, whereas STEP and HePTP bound preferentially to p38alpha. Under reducing conditions, the association of p38alpha with STEP or HePTP was impaired, whereas the association with PTP-SL was unaffected. On the other hand, the association of ERK1/2 with HePTP was increased under reducing conditions, whereas the association with STEP or PTP-SL was unaffected. In intact cells, PTP-SL and STEP distinctively regulated the kinase activity and the nuclear translocation of ERK1/2 and p38alpha. Our results suggest that intracellular redox conditions could modulate the activity and subcellular location of ERK1/2 and p38alpha by controlling their association with their regulatory PTPs.
