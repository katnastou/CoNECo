We asked whether the two peripheral SAM proteins Sam35 and Sam37, which expose domains at the cytosolic side, also affect the biogenesis pathway of Tom22. The essential protein Sam35 was addressed through use of the temperature-sensitive yeast mutant sam35-2. The cells were exposed to an in vivo heat shock at 37degreesC for 10 h, and mitochondria were isolated and analyzed for steady-state protein levels. Remarkably, the level of Tom22 in the sam35-2 mutant mitochondria was reduced to a greater extent than that of Tom40, whereas further proteins analyzed were present in similar amounts as in wild-type mitochondria (Fig. 2 A). For protein import experiments, we used sam35-2 mitochondria that were isolated from cells grown at permissive conditions. Before incubation with radiolabeled precursor proteins, the isolated mitochondria were subjected to a short-term shift to nonpermissive conditions (37degreesC). Similar to the situation with sam50-1 mitochondria, the sam35-2 mitochondria retain wild-type levels of the TOM complex in addition to all of the mitochondrial marker proteins analyzed and efficiently import precursor proteins to internal mitochondrial compartments. However, the assembly of Tom22 was strongly inhibited in sam35-2 mitochondria (Fig. 2 B). As controls, the import of Tom40 displayed the classic defect in beta-barrel protein assembly, whereas the import of Tom20 and Tom70 remained unaffected (Fig. 2, C and D). Thus, the second essential SAM protein, Sam35, also affects the assembly pathway of the precursor of Tom22.
