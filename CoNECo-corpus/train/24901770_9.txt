Endogenous Arabidopsis AtGRIP was detected as a 92 kDa monomer by western blotting with an anti-AtGRIP antibody. After treatment with the chemical cross-linker 3, 3'-dithiobis (sulphosuccinimidyl propionate) (DTSSP), western blot showed a band of more than 220 kDa in the extract from an Arabidopsis seedling (Figure 1A Lane 5). These results indicated that the AtGRIP protein can form a homoligomer.
