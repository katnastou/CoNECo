USP15 stabilizes the transcription factor Nrf1 in the nucleus, promoting the proteasome gene expression. 
The transcriptional factor Nrf1 (NF-E2-related factor 1) sustains protein homeostasis (proteostasis) by regulating the expression of proteasome genes. Under physiological conditions, the transcriptional activity of Nrf1 is repressed by its sequestration into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and furthermore by two independent ubiquitin-proteasome pathways, comprising Hrd1 and beta-TrCP in the cytoplasm and nucleus, respectively. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying Nrf1 activation remain unclear. Here, we report that USP15 (Ubiquitin-Specific Protease 15) activates Nrf1 in the nucleus by stabilizing it through deubiquitination. We first identified USP15 as an Nrf1-associated factor through proteome analysis. USP15 physically interacts with Nrf1, and it markedly stabilizes Nrf1 by removing its ubiquitin moieties. USP15 activates the Nrf1-mediated expression of a proteasome gene luciferase reporter and endogenous proteasome activity. The siRNA-mediated knockdown of USP15 diminishes the Nrf1-induced proteasome gene expression in response to proteasome inhibition. These results uncover a new regulatory mechanism that USP15 activates Nrf1 against the beta-TrCP inhibition to maintain proteostasis.
