It has been suggested that factors selectively expressed in the striatum may render GABAergic projection neurons (medium-sized spiny neurons) particularly susceptible to degeneration. We previously performed a transcriptome SAGE (serial analysis of gene expression) analysis of different regions of the mouse brain, which identified about 120 genes preferentially expressed in the striatum. Most of the products of these genes were confirmed to be 'striatal-enriched' by checking against a freely available transcriptomic database (e.g. Allen Brain Atlas). In our initial screen, some of these newly identified striatal gene products displayed significantly lower than normal levels of expression in the brains of Huntington's disease mouse models and patients. More recent studies confirmed these findings, showing that a subset of approximately 70 striatal gene products (e.g. ADORA2A, DCLK3, GPR88, RGS2, RGS9, SCN4B) are downregulated in knock-in Huntington's disease mice. However, the functions of these striatal gene products are frequently unknown, and their potential roles in the vulnerability of the striatum in Huntington's disease remain a matter of speculation.
