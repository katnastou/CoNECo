Molecular characterization of transgenic AtGRP8-RQ ox lines. (A) WT, AtGRP8-ox and AtGRP8-RQ-ox plants were harvested at zt3 and zt11. The RNA gel blot was hybridized with the AtGRP8 cDNA to determine the total transcript level (top) and with the gene-specific probe to monitor the endogenous AtGRP8 transcript (middle). The position of the pre-mRNA, as_AtGRP8 retaining the first half of the intron and the mRNA are indicated. Boxes represent exons, lines represent the first and the second half of the intron, respectively. The ethidium-bromide stained gel shows equal loading (bottom). (B) The immunoblot with total protein of WT plants, the AtGRP8-ox lines 5 and 21, and the AtGRP8-RQ-ox lines 1, 4 and 5, harvested at zt11, was probed with the AtGRP8 antibody (top) and an antibody against LHCP as loading control (bottom). (C) The RNA gel blot shown in (A) was stripped and rehybridized with the AtGRP7 probe. (D) The immunoblot with the same protein extracts as shown in (B) was probed with the AtGRP7 antibody (top) and the LHCP antibody (bottom).
