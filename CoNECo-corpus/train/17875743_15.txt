To gain insight into the mechanism by which Rpb7p functions in the major mRNA decay, we examined what step(s) in mRNAs turnover is/are stimulated by Rpb7p. Cells were shifted to 42degreesC to inactivate both transcription and the function of Rpb7p ts form, and then the levels and poly(A) tail lengths of RPL29 and RPL25 mRNAs were monitored using the polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis Northern (PAGEN) technique, as shown in Fig. 3. These mRNAs were chosen because their short length enables detection of small differences in the size of their poly(A) tail. Three conclusions can be made concerning the results shown in Fig. 3. First, the decay kinetics of these mRNAs is fast in WT cells and slower in mutant cells, consistent with our results obtained by standard Northern analysis shown in Fig. 2. Second, deadenylation is abnormally slow in the mutant cells. For example, whereas complete deadenylation of RPL29 mRNA is observed in WT after 45 min (Fig. 3, lane 5), it takes 70 min for this to occur in rpb7-28 (Fig. 3, lane 13). We conclude that Rpb7-28p is defective in stimulating rapid deadenylation. As shown in Fig. 3, after its complete deadenylation 25 min post-transcription arrest, it is only a further 20 min before RPL25 mRNA is almost completely degraded in WT (between 25 to 45 min post-transcription arrest; see lanes 4 and 5). In contrast, to degrade comparably the deadenylated RPL25 mRNA in rpb7-28 takes 75 min (lanes 12-14). A third conclusion, then, is that Rpb7p stimulates not only deadenylation, but also post-deadenylation step.
