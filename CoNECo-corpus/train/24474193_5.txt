HDAC6 is highly expressed in human pancreatic cancer. (A) Immunohistochemistry of HDAC6 expression in normal pancreas, pancreatic cancer, and adjacent tissue samples. Representative images of samples with low and high expression of HDAC6 are shown. (B) Quantification of normal pancreas, pancreatic cancer, and adjacent tissue samples with low or high expression of HDAC6. (C) Quantitative real-time RT-PCR analysis of HDAC6 mRNA levels in normal pancreas, pancreatic cancer, and adjacent tissue samples
