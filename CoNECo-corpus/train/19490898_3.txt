Rho GTPases are key regulators of the actin-based cytoskeleton and thus control most aspects of cell dynamics, including migration, division, and morphogenesis. There are at least 20 members of this subfamily of Ras-like GTPases in humans, and although many have been studied in great detail, the so-called atypical Rho GTPase subset are much less well understood. Three atypical Rho GTPases, RhoBTB1, 2 and 3, are much larger (67-83kD) than conventional Rho proteins and are comprised of N-terminal, Rho-related domains followed by one or more BTB (Bric-a-brac, Tramtrack, Broad-complex) domains (Fig. 1). BTB domains are found in about 200 proteins and are thought to mediate protein:protein interactions.
