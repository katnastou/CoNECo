Because suppression of NPF signaling did not increase sleep behavior under standard environmental conditions, we hypothesized that the effects of reduced NPF function on sleep-wake behavior might manifest only under more severe nutritional environments where NPF signaling is normally promoted. Indeed, enhanced NPF signaling putatively mimics a food deprivation state that promotes appetitive memory formation and retrieval under fed conditions. We therefore examined whether starvation-induced sleep loss was affected by loss of NPF. As previously shown, control animals exhibited a significant increase in wake approximately 12h after starvation onset (Figure 2A, B). However, NPFSK2 mutants did not exhibit a significant change in wake behavior during the same interval compared to fed controls (Figure 2A, B), establishing that NPF is required for starvation-induced sleep loss during this period. Notably, Kir2.1-mediated inhibition of NPF+ neurons either constitutively or exclusively as adults did not recapitulate the NPF mutant phenotype, suggesting either compensatory effects in these neurons or incomplete silencing of neuron function. Taken together, these observations suggest that NPF signaling plays a minor role in modulating sleep when nutrients are replete, yet may be recruited to promote wakefulness under limited or challenging nutritional environments.
