A homologous recombination-based method was used to tag endogenous Scp3 with GFP (Green Fluorescent Protein) at its carboxyl terminus. The scp3 + ORF, except for the first methionine and terminal codon, was amplified using the KOD-Plus PCR kit (TOYOBO) with a pair of primers carrying SalI and NotI sites. The PCR product was digested with SalI and NotI and cloned into the plasmid, with the inserted GFP fragment located in frame at the carboxyl terminus. For ectopic expression of Scp3 tagged with GFP, the ORF of the scp3 + gene, except for the terminal codon, was amplified using the KOD-Plus PCR kit (TOYOBO) with a pair of primers carrying SalI and NotI sites and cloned into the pREP81 plasmid, with the inserted GFP fragment located at the carboxyl terminus in frame.
