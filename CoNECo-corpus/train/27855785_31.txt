(A) Representative images of autophagic bodies in pep4Delta (left) or hrr25-5pep4Delta (right) cells 1.5 hr after nitrogen starvation at 37degreesC. Scale bar represents 500 nm. (B) Histogram showing the distribution of the number of autophagic bodies per cell section in WT and the hrr25-5 mutant. The number of autophagic bodies was quantitated for 100 cell sections for each strain (left). p-value = 0.0016; Mann-Whitney Test. Box plot of the number of autophagic bodies per cell section. Bars show data between the lower and upper quartiles, the median is a horizontal line within the box. Whiskers indicate the smallest and largest observations (right). (C) The diameter of autophagic bodies was determined. For WT N = 396, for hrr25-5 N = 254. Averages with error bars as s.e.m. are shown.
