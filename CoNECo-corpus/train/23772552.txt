Development of a high-throughput screen to detect inhibitors of TRPS1 sumoylation. 
Small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO) belongs to the family of ubiquitin-like proteins (Ubls) that can be reversibly conjugated to target-specific lysines on substrate proteins. Although covalently sumoylated products are readily detectible in gel-based assays, there has been little progress toward the development of robust quantitative sumoylation assay formats for the evaluation of large compound libraries. In an effort to identify inhibitors of ubiquitin carrier protein 9 (Ubc9)-dependent sumoylation, a high-throughput fluorescence polarization assay was developed, which allows detection of Lys-1201 sumoylation, corresponding to the major site of functional sumoylation within the transcriptional repressor trichorhino-phalangeal syndrome type I protein (TRPS1). A minimal hexapeptide substrate peptide, TMR-VVK1201TEK, was used in this assay format to afford high-throughput screening of the GlaxoSmithKline diversity compound collection. A total of 728 hits were confirmed but no specific noncovalent inhibitors of Ubc9 dependent trans-sumoylation were found. However, several diaminopyrimidine compounds were identified as inhibitors in the assay with IC50 values of 12.5 muM. These were further characterized to be competent substrates which were subject to sumoylation by SUMO-Ubc9 and which were competitive with the sumoylation of the TRPS1 peptide substrates.
