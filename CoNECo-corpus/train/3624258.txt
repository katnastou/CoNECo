Partial repair of deamidation-damaged calmodulin by protein carboxyl methyltransferase.  Modification of calmodulin by protein carboxyl methyltransferase requires deamidation of one or more labile asparagine residues (Johnson, B.A., Freitag, N. E., and Aswad, D. W. (1985) J. Biol. Chem. 260, 10913-10916). We now show that deamidation results in the generation of two altered forms of calmodulin, designated A and B, which can be separated by electrophoresis under nondenaturing conditions. The A form is characterized by a larger apparent molecular radius, has only 10% the activity of native calmodulin when assayed for its ability to activate a Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase from rat brain, and serves as an excellent substrate for the methyltransferase. The B form more closely resembles native calmodulin: it has an apparent molecular radius more like the native, exhibits about 40% the activity of native calmodulin, and is a relatively poor methyl acceptor. Evidence suggests that the A and B forms probably contain isoaspartate (A) and aspartate (B) in place of Asn-60 and/or Asn-97. Incubation of the A form with methyltransferase and S-adenosyl-L-methionine converts about half of the A form to an electrophoretic band indistinguishable from the B form. The activity of this partly converted calmodulin rises to 30-50% that of native calmodulin. These observations imply that the methyltransferase may have a biological role in restoring activity to proteins which contain abnormal isoaspartyl peptide bonds resulting from asparagine deamidation.
