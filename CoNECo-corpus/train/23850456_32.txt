Direct comparison of PRDC and SOST monomers reveals an RMSD of 3.3 Aa when aligning their cystine knot motifs, including F1 and F2 of their DAN domains. However, PRDC shows a number of significant structural differences in the N-terminus and Wrist region, accounting for an overall RMSD of 8.7 Aa (Figure 6B). Interestingly, these same regions form important contacts at the dimer interface of PRDC, providing an explanation of the assembly differences of PRDC and SOST (dimer vs. monomer). In terms of BMP inhibition, there is limited conservation between PRDC and SOST for the hydrophobic residues defining the BMP-binding epitope (Figure 6A). Without these residues, it would be expected that SOST would be limited in terms of BMP-binding affinity or bind BMP utilizing a different epitope than PRDC. Certainly a key structural difference between the two DAN family members is dimerization. Therefore, a dimer with two BMP binding epitopes would offer an advantage to affinity when binding to BMP ligands, much like the Noggin dimer. Furthermore, lack of dimer formation might allow SOST to function as a more effective Wnt inhibitor. Recent studies have pinpointed the interaction of SOST with LRP5/6 to a linear stretch of residues within the wrist region of SOST. Besides a lack of conservation with PRDC, these residues are packed at the dimer interface and would not be solvent accessible as in SOST. Therefore, differences in specific residues and overall oligimerization could differentiate BMP or Wnt antagonism. In the future, it will be interesting to see if those DAN family antagonists that exist as dimers solely exhibit anti-BMP functionality. In support of this notion, we have previously characterized Dan, which is very different than PRDC and SOST, to exist as a non-covalent dimer capable of inhibiting BMP signaling. In sight of this, it can be expected that Gremlin, a potent inhibitor of BMP signaling, also exists as a dimer.
