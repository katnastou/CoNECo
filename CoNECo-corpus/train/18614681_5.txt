In Drosophila, the expression of particular Or genes, and hence the odor-specificity of the ORN, has recently been found to depend on a regulatory code of cis-acting elements. Transcription factors that act in the process of receptor gene expression include Acj6 (Abnormal chemosensory jump 6), a POU transcription factor. The acj6 gene was identified by a defect in olfactory behavior. In a null mutant of acj6, some maxillary palp ORNs respond normally to odors, some are present but have lost response to all odors, and some undergo changes in odor specificity. Correspondingly, acj6 is required for the expression of a subset of Or genes.
