Rai1 is bound about 30 Aa away and on the opposite face from the active site of Rat1 (Fig. 1b). The primary interactions involve the poorly conserved C-terminal segment of Rat1 and the beta8-alphaE segment and strand beta4 of Rai1 (Fig. 1d, Supplemental Fig. 6). Approximately 800 Aa2 of the surface area of Rat1 and Rai1 are buried in this interface, and the two surfaces at the interface are highly complementary to each other, with a shape correlation score of 0.76, consistent with the stability of the Rat1-Rai1 complex (see below).
