(A) GIM3 or gim3increment cells expressing Guk1-7-GFP were grown at 25degreesC and then incubated at either 25degreesC or 37degreesC for 2 hours in the presence of CHX before fixation and imaging. (B) GIM3 and gim3increment cells expressing Guk1-7-GFP along with an empty vector control or GIM3 were incubated at 25degreesC or 37degreesC for two hours in the presence of CHX before fixation and imaging. (C) GIM3 or gim3increment cells expressing Guk1-7-GFP were incubated at 25degreesC and then shifted to 37degreesC. Samples were collected at the indicated time points and then fixed before imaging. For all images, the scale bar represents 5mum and dotted lines demark cell boundaries.
