The pathogenic effects of gating pore mutations depend on inward leak of Na+. The R2S gating pore was not significantly selective among Cs+, K+, or Na+ (Fig. 1g). As for NaV1.4, guanidinium was exceptionally permeant in the gating pore of NaVAb/R2S, with a ratio of PGua:PNa ~28. Methylguanidine and ethylguanidine were less permeant (Fig. 1g). The ion selectivity of the outward gating pore current conducted by NaVAb/R3G was Cs+>K+~Na+ (Fig. 1h). However, the permeation of guanidinium was less than Na+ in NaVAb/R3G and >40-fold less than in NaVAb/R2S (Fig. 1h). The weak selectivity among inorganic cations for R2S and R3G and the high guanidinium permeability through R2S are characteristic of corresponding mutations in NaV1.4, further supporting NaVAb as a valid model for structural studies of gating pore mutations.
