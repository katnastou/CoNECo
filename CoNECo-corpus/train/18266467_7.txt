Bioinformatic analyses indicated that B14 is a member of a family of poxvirus proteins that include B14, K7, C6, and A52. Subsequently, the A46 protein was shown to be related to A52 and was added to this family. Given that proteins A46 and A52 are intracellular inhibitors of TLR signaling pathways, the presence of B14 in the same family suggested that B14 might also act to regulate signaling pathways leading to NF-kappaB activation.
