To determine whether the response to fasting is conserved across mammals, we measured Arrdc3 expression levels in multiple tissues of mice fed ad libitum or fasted 14 h. Real-time PCR analysis showed that fasting induced Arrdc3 expression most prominently in visceral (epididymal) fat (5.6-fold), with significant induction in brown fat (2.3-fold) and skeletal muscle (3.9-fold) as well (Figure 3D). We then performed northern analysis and confirmed a striking induction of Arrdc3 by fasting in visceral fat and skeletal muscle (Figure 3E).
