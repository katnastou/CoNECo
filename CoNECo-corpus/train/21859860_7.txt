We examined the expression of Set7 in different adult mouse tissues. RT-PCR analysis showed that Set7 is expressed in all tissues tested, including skeletal muscle (Fig. 1 A). We next investigated the potential change of Set7 expression during muscle differentiation. C2C12 myoblasts are a well-established cell line that can faithfully mimic skeletal muscle differentiation in vitro, as indicated by the terminal differentiation and expression of muscle differentiation marker genes, upon serum withdrawal. RT-PCR and Western blot analyses demonstrate that the expression level of both Set7 transcript and protein increases during C2C12 differentiation (Fig. 1, B and C), occurring in parallel with increased expression of the muscle differentiation markers myogenin and myosin heavy chain (MHC; Fig. 1, B and C). Together, these data demonstrate that the expression of Set7 is dynamically regulated during normal skeletal muscle differentiation, suggesting a role in skeletal muscle development.
