We previously determined CIITA's ubiquitination status to include mono, K63, and K48 ubiquitination. Bhat et al. showed the three sites of monoubiquitination on CIITA are necessary for CIITA stability and for increased CIITA transactivity. Additionally, we previously demonstrated CIITA modified by K63 linked ubiquitination plays a role in CIITA movement from the cytoplasm to the nucleus. Knowing that several types of ubiquitination linkages modify CIITA, we wanted to determine if pCAF was able to facilitate all three types of CIITA ubiquitination. Previously, we demonstrated pCAF is able to mediate K48 linked CIITA ubiquitination in the absence of CIITA acetylation. To investigate if pCAF is able to mediate various ubiquitin linkages on CIITA, we conducted in vivo ubiquitination assays. We demonstrate CIITA monoubiquitination, K63, and K48 linked ubiquitination all increase in the presence of WT pCAF as compared to assays performed when WT CIITA is expressed alone (Figures 8(a), 8(b), and 8(c), compare lanes 1 and 2). When the proteasome inhibitor MG132 inhibits the 26S proteasome, all three forms of ubiquitinated CIITA accumulated indicating maximum ubiquitination levels (Figures 8(a), 8(b), and 8(c), lane 3). These data indicate pCAF's ability to mediate multiple forms of ubiquitination of CIITA.
