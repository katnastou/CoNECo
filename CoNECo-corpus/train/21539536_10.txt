To perform siRNA studies in erythroid cells, they were transfected on day 11 using the CD34+-Nucleofector kit (Amaxa). Briefly, 3 x 106 cells were incubated in 100 mul of Nucleofector solution with si-KLF4 [100 and 300 nmol/l] or Scr [100 nmol/l] control; all samples were also treated with 2 mug of the pMAxGFP reporter (Amaxa) to monitor transfection efficiency. Cells were electroporated on the U-08 setting for erythroid progenitors and incubated for 72 h. The same experimental conditions were employed to perform enforced expression studies. Primary cells (5 x 106) were electroporated with 5 or 10 mug of pMT3 or pMT3-KLF4 expression vector and 2 mug of pMAxGFP. The pMT3-KLF4 expression vector carried a full-length cDNA for the human KLF4 gene, a kind gift from Dr Vincent Yang, Emory University School of Medicine.
