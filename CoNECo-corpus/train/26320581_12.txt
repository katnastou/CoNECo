The catalytic domain of MLL4(tag) adopts the canonical beta-fold structure observed for other SET domains, and closely resembles that of MLL1 (Figures 3C and 3D). The N-flanking region of MLL4 forms an extended helical structure, and is markedly different from the extended loop observed for MLL1. Conserved features include the cofactor binding site, which is located in a surface pocket created by the intersection of the SET-N, SET-C, and postSET domains. The position of the substrate binding channel is located between the SET-I and postSET domains, and is indicated in Figure 3C. The C-terminal tag immediately follows the conserved Cys4Zn cluster and enters the substrate binding channel before turning and passing over the cofactor. The tag was required for crystallization but resulted in a catalytically dead construct (Figure 3B), and its impact on the MLL4 SET domain structure and activity is discussed in detail in Figure S3. An equivalent MLL4 construct prepared with an N-terminal tag, like the MLL4(WIN) construct, had high intrinsic activity (Figure 3B), indicating that the determinants of this intrinsic activity are contained within this region of the SET domain. The lack of methyltransferase activity observed with the C-terminally tagged construct can be attributed to partial blocking of the substrate binding channel and interactions with the cofactor.
