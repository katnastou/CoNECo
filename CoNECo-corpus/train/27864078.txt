Inappropriate translation inhibition and P-body formation cause cold-sensitivity in tryptophan-auxotroph yeast mutants.  
In response to different adverse conditions, most eukaryotic organisms, including Saccharomyces cerevisiae, downregulate protein synthesis through the phosphorylation of eIF2alpha (eukaryotic initiation factor 2alpha) by Gcn2, a highly conserved protein kinase. Gcn2 also controls the translation of Gcn4, a transcription factor involved in the induction of amino acid biosynthesis enzymes. Here, we have studied the functional role of Gcn2 and Gcn2-regulating proteins, in controlling translation during temperature downshifts of TRP1 and trp1 yeast cells. Our results suggest that neither cold-instigated amino acid limitation nor Gcn2 are involved in the translation suppression at low temperature. However, loss of TRP1 causes increased eIF2alpha phosphorylation, Gcn2-dependent polysome disassembly and overactivity of Gcn4, which result in cold-sensitivity. Indeed, knock-out of GCN2 improves cold growth of trp1 cells. Likewise, mutation of several Gcn2-regulators and effectors results in cold-growth effects. Remarkably, we found that Hog1, the osmoresponsive MAPK, plays a role in the regulatory mechanism of Gcn2-eIF2alpha. Finally, we demonstrated that P-body formation responds to a downshift in temperature in a TRP1-dependent manner and is required for cold tolerance.
