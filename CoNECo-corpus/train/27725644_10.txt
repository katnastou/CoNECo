We next sought to narrow the Nop9-binding site within Subdomain A and found that the base of the stem-loop region and the adjacent 5' flanking region were critical for Nop9 binding. The 5' single-stranded nucleotides 1-16 were necessary, but are not sufficient for binding: deleting 5' nucleotides 1-16 abrogated binding, but nucleotides 1-16 alone did not bind Nop9 (Supplementary Table 1). We could trim 5' nucleotides 1-6 without affecting binding affinity, indicating the importance of 5' nucleotides closer to the stem. Deleting the 3' single-stranded region reduced binding affinity 6.5-fold, suggesting that it contributes to binding affinity, but not to the same extent as the 5' flanking nucleotides and stem loop. Classical PUF proteins such as PUM1 recognize RNA bases using hydrogen bond and stacking interactions, and binding is insensitive to salt concentration. In contrast, interaction of Puf-A/Puf6 proteins with phosphate groups of single- or double-stranded RNA is highly sensitive to salt concentration. Nop9:ITS1 RNA binding was only modestly sensitive to salt concentration (Supplementary Table 2), consistent with specific H-bond or base-stacking interactions that recognize RNA sequence elements.
