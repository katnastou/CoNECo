The 27-amino acid region from the D-AKAP2 AKB (residues 623-650) was synthesized and purified to greater than 95% purity by HPLC (Peptron, Inc). The last residue was changed to Cys for fluorescent labeling. 0.5 mg of protein was incubated overnight with a 2-fold molar excess of fluorescin-5-maleimide or tetramethylrhodamine-5-maleimide (Molecular Probes, Inc.). The labeled peptides were purified by HPLC and excess organic solvent was evaporated on a Speed Vac (Savant, Inc.). Concentrations were determined using absorbance at 485 nm (epsilon485nm=90000 M-1 cm-1) and 541 nm (epsilon541nm=91000 M-1 cm-1) for the fluorescein- and rhodamine-labeled peptides, respectively. Binding studies with full-length and mutant proteins were carried out as previously described.
