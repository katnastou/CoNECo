The DFz2C granules within the INM invaginations appeared to be bounded by membrane (Fig.3D; arrow). If these granules are enveloped by the INM, then Lamin immunoreactivity could surround the dense granules. Indeed, LamC immunoreactivity lined the outer edge of the DFz2C granules (Fig.3E,G; SF3B; N= 29 animals; 93 foci), which correlates well with our observations of DFz2C/LamC foci at the light level.
