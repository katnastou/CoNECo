The 75 kDa human BCRP is a polytopic plasma membrane transport protein which has been detected in many drug-resistant cell lines, solid tumors, and hematological malignancies. Transport studies using BCRP-overexpressing intact cells or BCRP-enriched plasma membrane vesicles have established that BCRP can actively transport a broad spectrum of substrates, ranging from hydrophobic chemotherapeutics to hydrophilic anionic conjugated endo- and xenobiotics. BCRP is highly expressed in organs important for the absorption (the small intestine), distribution (e.g., the blood-brain and placental barriers), and elimination (e.g., the liver and kidney) of drugs, and plays an important role in drug disposition.
