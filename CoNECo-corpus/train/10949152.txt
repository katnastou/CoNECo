Heterogeneity of cardiac rat and human elongation factor 2. 
Elongation factor 2 (EF-2) catalyses the last step of the elongation cycle, translocation, in the course of protein biosynthesis. A system for analyzing post-translational modifications of EF-2, which is a single polypeptide of 857 amino acids, is reported and its application to cytosolic extracts of cultured neonatal rat heart myocytes, neonatal and adult rat cardiac tissue, and extracts of human left ventricular myocardium is described. Comparing different pH ranges in immobilized pH gradient-isoelectric focusing (IPG-IEF), a range of pH 3 - 10 and 4 - 9 resulted in a highly defined and reproducible resolution of six different EF-2 variants of all extracts in the first dimension. These six variants were detected by the "imaging plate" (phosphor radiation image sensor) after specific labeling with Pseudomonas exotoxin A catalyzed [32P]ADP-ribosylation. This finding could be confirmed in Western blot analysis with a specific polyclonal rabbit antibody. Using two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (2-D-PAGE), five to six EF-2 variants could be demonstrated in all extracts. By application of a second IPG indicator strip to the 2-D gel, they could be aligned with corresponding spots in a silver-stained 2-D separation of human myocardial tissue, revealing that the EF-2 variants belong to the group of low-abundance proteins.
