For evaluating the effect of WIF1, DN-LEF1, and TCF4shRNA expression on cell proliferation, T24 and TSU-PR1 cells stably transfected with WIF1, DN-LEF1, TCF4shRNA, or control pRK5 were cultured for 1, 3, and 5 days in 24-well plates. For studying the effects of recombinant WD protein on cell proliferation, T24 cells were treated with different concentrations of recombinant WD protein in 24-well plates for 2 days. The 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (Sigma) was added to a final concentration of 1 mg/mL. The reaction mixture was incubated for 3 h at 37degreesC and the absorbance was measured at 570 nm.
