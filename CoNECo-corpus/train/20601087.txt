Regulation of the p53 pathway by ubiquitin and related proteins. 
The p53 tumour suppressor protein is subject to many levels of control, including modification with ubiquitin and related proteins such as SUMO and NEDD8. These modifications regulate p53 at a number of levels, including control of protein turnover, alterations in sub-cellular localization and changes in the ability to regulate gene expression. Numerous E3 ligases that can mediate these modifications of p53 have been described, some of which promote conjugation with more than one ubiquitin-like protein. Understanding the complexity of this mechanism of p53 regulation will help in the development of therapeutic drugs that function to modulate these events.
