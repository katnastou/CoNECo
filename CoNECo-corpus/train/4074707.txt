Kinetics of hemoprotein reduction and interprotein heme transfer.  
The transfer of hemin from one protein to another is an event biologically important for the conservation of heme iron. Hemin entering the circulation (or added to serum) is mainly bound by albumin and then transferred to hemopexin [Morgan, W.T., Liem, H.H., Sutor, R.P., & Muller-Eberhard, U. (1976) Biochim. Biophys. Acta 444, 435-445], and we are now investigating which mechanisms may be operative in enhancing this process. The presence of imidazole has been demonstrated to accelerate hemin transfer from albumin to hemopexin [Pasternack, R.F., Gibbs, E.J., Hoeflin, E., Kosar, W.P., Kubera, G., Skowronek, C. A., Wong, N.M., & Muller-Eberhard, U. (1983) Biochemistry 22, 1753-1758]. The present work is an examination of the effect of the reduction of albumin-bound hemin on the rate of its transfer to hemopexin. Hemin (HmIII., ferriprotoporphyrin IX) was reduced to HmII (ferroprotoporphyrin IX) by the addition of sodium dithionite under argon. The reduction kinetics of HmIII to HmII were studied separately in the two complexes: with human serum albumin (HSA), which binds up to 20 mol of heme/mol (the first mole with K congruent to 10(8)), and with hemopexin (HHx), which binds heme equimolarly (K congruent to 10(13)). The rate of reduction of HmIII to HmII on HSA was first order over several half-lives and linearly dependent on [S2O4(2-)]1/2. At [HSA]0/[HmIII] = 3, the kobsd was (5 X 10(-3) + 0.75[S2O4(2-)]1/2, and with [HSA]/[HmIII] approximately 25, the kobsd was (2 X 10(-3)) + 0.25[S2O4(2-)]1/2. The reduction of HmIII to HmII on human hemopexin (HHx) is much more rapid with kobsd = (2.5 X 10(3))[S2O4(2-)]1/2.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
