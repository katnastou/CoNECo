The zmm mutants have similar defects in crossover frequencies, however, msh4 and msh5 display improved chromosome segregation at 33degreesC. At least two observations suggest that temperature modulates chromosome segregation independently of increasing crossover frequencies. First, crossover frequencies on chromosome III were similar at 23 and 33degreesC (Table 3). Second, missegregation of the non-exchange homeolog chromosome pair was also improved at 33degreesC in msh4 cells.
