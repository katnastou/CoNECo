The melanoma (A375-TetOn and BLM-TetOn) cells were generated using the Tet-On expression system (Clontech, Inc., Heidelberg, Germany) as described previously. Briefly, the melanoma cell lines (A375 and BLM) were transfected with pTet-On plasmid. Twenty-four hours later, the transfected cells were challenged with G418 (600 mug/ml) for selection. After 6 weeks, single clones were picked up and expanded. The induction level was examined by the transfection of pTRE2hyg-Luciferase vector and subsequent induction of luciferase expression by the addition of Dox (10 ng/ml) for 24 hrs. The induction levels of each clone were determined using luciferase assay as described. Clones with high induction level and low background were chosen for the transfection with pTRE2 hyg-APR-1. Cells were cultured in the presence of both G418 (600 mug/ml) and Hygromycine (300 mug/ml). Single clones were picked up and expanded for further examination using qRT-PCR and luciferase assay. Clones with high induction levels were chosen for functional analysis of APR-1 protein.
