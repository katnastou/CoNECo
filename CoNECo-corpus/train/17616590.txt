The serine protease HhoA from Synechocystis sp. strain PCC 6803: substrate specificity and formation of a hexameric complex are regulated by the PDZ domain. 
Enzymes of the ATP-independent Deg serine endopeptidase family are very flexible with regard to their substrate specificity. Some family members cleave only one substrate, while others act as general proteases on unfolded substrates. The proteolytic activity of Deg proteases is regulated by PDZ protein interaction domains. Here we characterized the HhoA protease from Synechocystis sp. strain PCC 6803 in vitro using several recombinant protein constructs. The proteolytic activity of HhoA was found to increase with temperature and basic pH and was stimulated by the addition of Mg(2+) or Ca(2+). We found that the single PDZ domain of HhoA played a critical role in regulating protease activity and in the assembly of a hexameric complex. Deletion of the PDZ domain strongly reduced proteolysis of a sterically challenging resorufin-labeled casein substrate, but unlabeled beta-casein was still degraded. Reconstitution of the purified HhoA with total membrane proteins isolated from Synechocystis sp. wild-type strain PCC 6803 and a DeltahhoA mutant resulted in specific degradation of selected proteins at elevated temperatures. We concluded that a single PDZ domain of HhoA plays a critical role in defining the protease activity and oligomerization state, combining the functions that are attributed to two PDZ domains in the homologous DegP protease from Escherichia coli. Based on this first enzymatic study of a Deg protease from cyanobacteria, we propose a general role for HhoA in the quality control of extracytoplasmic proteins, including membrane proteins, in Synechocystis sp. strain PCC 6803.
