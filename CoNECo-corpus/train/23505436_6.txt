A. Schematic depiction of domain organization of human guanylate cyclase. The native enzyme is a heterodimer of alpha and beta subunits (encoded by GUCY1A3 and GUCY1B3, respectively), with interaction interfaces spread across the PAS, CC and cyclase catalytic domains. The catalytic domains associate in a head to tail orientation; conserved residues involved in substrate binding and catalysis are distributed between the two subunits. B. A list of conserved active-site residues in guanylate cyclase (sGCalpha and beta) and in the chimeric adenylate cyclase (AC-V C1 domain and AC-II C2 domain). A full alignment of adenylate and guanylate cyclases is shown in Supporting Fig. S1.
