Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) was performed as described previously. The antibodies used in this study include mouse monoclonal antibodies to the HA and Myc epitopes (F7 and 9E10, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and rabbit polyclonal antibodies to Met28 and Met32 (kindly provided by Mike Tyers, Samuel Lunenfeld Research Institute). DNA was quantified by real time PCR using the LightCycler 480 instrument, and reaction kits containing SYBR Green I (Roche). A typical run included duplicates of each IP and input DNA, and serial dilutions of one input DNA to create a standard curve and determine the efficiency of the amplification. Data was analyzed with the LightCycler 480 software using the 'second derivative maximum' method for quantification. Occupancy at a genomic location was calculated by dividing the immunoprecipitated (IP) over input DNA ratio for a fragment encompassing the location by the IP over input DNA ratio of a fragment of reference (typically, a sequence within the open reading frame of the meiotic gene IME2).
