(A) A diagram describing the molecular lesions of two Sox21a mutant alleles. Both alleles carry a large DNA fragment deletion spanning the coding region of Sox21a. (B-C) Cross-section of midgut from 2 day old (B) and 7 day old (C) Sox21a mutant flies. With age, Sox21a mutants developed tumors with multilayered structure (C). (D) Quantitative analysis of the tumor incidence at different regions of midgut with age. Genotypes of flies analyzed: wild type (WT), Sox21a-/- [JC1] and Sox21a-/- [JC2]. n = 40-50 guts. (E-G') Staining of NRE-lacZ (green) and Dl + Pros (red) in the midgut of WT (E), Sox21a mutant flies at day 2 (F) and day 7 (G, G') after eclosion. Compared to WT guts, Sox21a mutant guts did not show EB accumulation at day 2 (E, F), but showed dramatic EB accumulation at day 7 (G, G'). Accumulated lacZ+ cells were negative for Dl or Pros expression (G'). (H, H') Staining of NRE-lacZ (red) in Sox21a mutant clones on day 7 after clone induction. LacZ was cell-autonomously activated. Non-cell autonomous LacZ+ cell clusters were also observed (see text). (I-I') Staining of Dl (white), Pros (red) in Sox21a mutant clones. The Dl+ cells were scatteredly distributed in the clones, and Pros+ cell was rarely found within the mutant clones. (J, J') Staining of Pdm1 (red) in Sox21a mutant clones.. Pdm1 expression was absent in the entire mutant clones. Scale bars: 20 mum.
