Triterpenoid CDDO-Me blocks the NF-kappaB pathway by direct inhibition of IKKbeta on Cys-179. 
The novel oleanane triterpenoid 2-cyano-3,12-dioxooleana-1,9,-dien-28-oic acid (CDDO) and the C-28 methyl ester (CDDO-Me) induce apoptosis of human tumor cells by disruption of redox balance and are currently in clinical trials. The present studies show that CDDO and CDDO-Me block tumor necrosis factoralpha-induced targeting of NF-kappaB p65 to the nucleus. CDDO-Me also blocked tumor necrosis factor alpha-induced phosphorylation of IkappaBalpha. In concert with these results, we found that CDDO-Me inhibits IkappaBalpha kinasebeta (IKKbeta) activity in cells. In support of a direct mechanism, CDDO-Me inhibited recombinant IKKbeta activity in vitro. The results also demonstrate that (i) CDDO and CDDO-Me form adducts with IKKbeta, but not IKKbeta with mutation of Cys-179 to Ala, and (ii) CDDO-Me inhibits IKKbeta by a mechanism dependent on oxidation of Cys-179. These findings indicate that CDDO and CDDO-Me directly block IKKbeta activity and thereby the NF-kappaB pathway by interacting with Cys-179 in the IKKbeta activation loop.
