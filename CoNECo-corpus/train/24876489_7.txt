There are two key features in the pattern of subunit arrangement. First, pseudo-symmetry mismatch is present between the extracellular region and the TMD. The GluN1a and GluN2B subunits are arranged in a 1-2-1-2 orientation with two-fold symmetry between the two GluN1a/GluN2B heterodimers in the ATD and LBD, but with pseudo-four-fold symmetry in the TMD (Fig. 2). A similar subunit arrangement is observed in the GluA2 homotetrameric structure that has two-fold symmetries within and between homodimers of the ATD and LBD and fourfold symmetry in the TMD indicating that symmetry mismatch may be common to iGluR structures. The second important feature is swapping of dimer pairs between the ATD and LBD layers (Fig. 2A and B). In the ATD layer, heterodimer pairs assemble as GluN1a (alpha)/GluN2B (alpha) and GluN1 (beta)/GluN2B (beta) whereas in the LBD layer, they assemble as GluN1a (alpha)/GluN2B (beta) and GluN1 (beta)/GluN2B (alpha) (Fig. 2A and B). A similar pattern of domain swapping is also observed in the homotetrameric GluA2 AMPA receptor where subunits assemble as a dimer of A/B and C/D homodimers at the ATD and as a dimer of A/D and B/C dimers at the LBD (Fig. 2A and B). Overall the conformations of GluN1a and GluN2B subunits approximately correspond to those of A/C and B/D subunits in the GluA2 AMPA receptor homotetramer. This assignment is based on the observation that the ATD-LBD linker and the M3-LBD linker are respectively more "distal" and "proximal" from the overall two-fold symmetry axis for GluN1a than GluN2B similar to the orientation of the A/C than B/D subunits in the GluA2 AMPA receptor (Fig. 2 and fig. S10).
