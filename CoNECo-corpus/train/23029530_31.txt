To determine whether TBC1D3 interacts with Fbw8 in a phosphorylation-dependent manner, an in vitro pull-down experiment was carried out with TBC1D3 bound to Protein-G beads (TBC1D3-beads) and a cytosol preparation obtained from a separate set of cells overexpressing Fbw8 (Fbw8-cytosol) (Figure 6A). The TBC1D3-beads were prepared from HeLa cells transfected with GFP-TBC1D3. After starvation, the cells were stimulated with or without FCS, lysed and TBC1D3 was immunoprecipitated with anti-GFP antibody. TBC1D3-beads were pre-incubated with or without alkaline phosphatase (AP) (37degreesC; 60 min). To test the recruitment of Fbw8 by TBC1D3, Fbw8-cytosol was added to each immunoprecipitate. The TBC1D3-beads were then washed and eluted with Laemmli sample buffer. Proteins associated with the anti-GFP pull-downs were then separated by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted for Fbw8. Figure 6A shows that in the absence of FCS stimulation, there was little recruitment of Fbw8 by the TBC1D3-beads. However, TBC1D3-Fbw8 binding was detected following FCS stimulation, suggesting a GF-dependent interaction between TBC1D3 and Fbw8. Moreover, treatment of TBC1D3-beads with AP abolished the ability of Fbw8 to bind to TBC1D3. These findings suggested that FCS-induced binding of Fbw8 to TBC1D3 is phosphorylation-dependent.
