Tissue-specific human beta-defensins (HBD)1, HBD2, and HBD3 secretion from human extra-placental membranes stimulated with Escherichia coli.  
During an ascending infection along the reproductive tract, the extra-placental membranes must act as a selective and competent barrier against pathogens. Human beta defensins (HBD)1, HBD2, and HBD3 are key elements of innate immunity that are secreted to neutralize/control the progression of infection. Full-thickness membranes were mounted on a Transwell device, constituted by two independent chambers, 1 x 10(6) CFU/ml of Escherichia coli were added to either the amnion (AMN) or the choriodecidual (CHD) face or to both. Secretion profiles of HBD1, HBD2, and HBD3 to the culture medium were quantified by ELISA. In comparison with basal conditions, the secretion profile of HBD1 remained without significant changes; HBD2 level in CHD and AMN increased 1.9- and 1.4-times, respectively, after stimulation with bacteria. HBD3 secretion level increased significantly (7.8 +/- 1.9 pg/micrograms) in the CHD but only if the stimulus was applied on the AMN side. Selective stimulation of extra-placental membranes with E. coli, results in a tissue specific secretion of HBD1, HBD2, and HBD3 mainly in the CHD, which is the first infected region during an ascending infection.
