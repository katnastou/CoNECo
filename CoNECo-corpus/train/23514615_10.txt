To determine the ability of wild-type and chimeric SIVcpz and SIVgor Vpus to promote virus release in the presence of tetherin, we co-transfected 293T cells with a vpu defective HIV-1 NL4-3 construct, pCGCG vectors expressing AU1-tagged versions of Vpu and different doses of human tetherin. In contrast to the parental SIVcpz and SIVgor proteins, all chimeras were capable of promoting infectious virus release (Figures 3A). The chimera between the HIV-1 TMD and the SIVgor BQ664 CP (NL-BQ) increased infectious virus release in both 293T and HeLa cells almost as efficiently as the control NL4-3 Vpu and was substantially more effective than the chimeras between HIV-1 and SIVcpzPtt Vpus (NL-MB, NL-EK) (Figures 3A, 3B). This was surprising because in contrast to the SIVcpzPtt MB897 and EK505 Vpus, the cytoplasmic part of the SIVgor BQ664 Vpu contains substitutions in the DSGxxS motif (DEGYES) and lacks a putative Yxxphi motif (Figure 1B). These results were confirmed by measuring the quantity of fectious virus and p24 release in the culture supernatant of HeLa cells co-transfected with proviral HIV-1 and Vpu expression constructs (Figures 3C to E). All Vpus that promoted infectious virus release in transiently transfected 293T cells were also active in HeLa cells (Figure 3F) and most Vpu proteins that reduced tetherin surface expression also enhanced virion release (Figure 3G, 3H).
