The core ABA signaling pathways consist of ABA-specific receptors and their downstream protein phosphatases and kinases. The pyrabactin resistance 1 (PYR1) and PYR1-like proteins (PYLs), also known as the regulatory component of ABA receptor (RCAR) family proteins, are ABA receptors. PYR1/PYL/RCARs interact with and inhibit clade-A protein phosphatase type 2Cs (PP2Cs) in the presence of ABA and release the SnRK2 protein kinases from inhibition by the PP2Cs. Activated SnRK2s phosphorylate transcription factors such as ABA-responsive element binding factors, ABI5, enhanced late embryogenesis abundant level, and flowering basic helix-loop-helix-type transcription factor 3 to alter gene expression. Activated SnRK2s also phosphorylate ion channels such as slow anion channel 1, K+ channel in Arabidopsis 1, and mechanosensitive channel of small conductance- like 9 to stimulate stomatal closure. SnRK2s also phosphorylate the nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate oxidase RBOHF, leading to the production of ROS. In addition, several other substrates of SnRK2s include proteins related to RNA binding, microRNA and epi-genetic regulation, chloroplast function, and many other processes based on phosphoproteomics analyses. Thus, PYR1/PYL/RCARs are thought to primarily regulate cellular functions using the PP2C-SnRK2 pathway.
