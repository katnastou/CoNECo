Mitochondrial MUL1 E3 ubiquitin ligase regulates Hypoxia Inducible Factor (HIF-1alpha) and metabolic reprogramming by modulating the UBXN7 cofactor protein.  MUL1 is a multifunctional E3 ubiquitin ligase anchored in the outer mitochondrial membrane with its RING finger domain facing the cytoplasm. MUL1 participates in various biological pathways involved in apoptosis, mitochondrial dynamics, and innate immune response. The unique topology of MUL1 enables it to "sense" mitochondrial stress in the intermembrane mitochondrial space and convey these signals through the ubiquitination of specific cytoplasmic substrates. We have identified UBXN7, the cofactor protein of the CRL2(VHL) ligase complex, as a specific substrate of MUL1 ligase. CRL2(VHL) ligase complex regulates HIF-1alpha protein levels under aerobic (normoxia) or anaerobic (hypoxia) conditions. Inactivation of MUL1 ligase leads to accumulation of UBXN7, with concomitant increase in HIF-1alpha protein levels, reduction in oxidative phosphorylation, and increased glycolysis. We describe a novel pathway that originates in the mitochondria and operates upstream of the CRL2(VHL) ligase complex. Furthermore, we delineate the mechanism by which the mitochondria, through MUL1 ligase, can inhibit the CRL2(VHL) complex leading to high HIF-1alpha protein levels and a metabolic shift to glycolysis under normoxic conditions.
