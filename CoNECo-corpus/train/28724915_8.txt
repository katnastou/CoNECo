To better correlate the QPRT levels to HCV infection in vivo, we re-assessed the hepatic QPRT levels in the previously characterized C/OTg mice, either 2 (acute infection) or 4 weeks (persistent infection) after HCVcc inoculation (Figure S1B for hepatic HCV RNA copies). Immunoblotting of HCV infected C/OTg livers indicated that QPRT expression was greatly reduced compared to the mock infection (Fig. 1C). To delineate how HCV would affect QPRT levels, we further performed in vitro analysis. HCV infection of Huh7.5.1 cells caused a decrease of QPRT protein in a time dependent manner (Fig. 1D). In this condition, the level of QPRT mRNA remained constant, and even slightly increased at 72 h after HCV infection (Fig. 1E). Therefore, HCV likely reduced QPRT at the post-translational level. Finally, inhibition of HCV replication in Huh7.1.5 cells by either NS3/4 A protease specific inhibitor VX950 (Fig. 1F) or IFNalpha (Fig. 1H) attenuated the declining tendency of QPRT. Thus, QPRT protein level would specifically respond to HCV replication. Both treatments effectively reduced viral replication, as measured by the drastic reduction of NS3 and core (Fig. 1F,H), and the reduced percentage of GFP+ Huh7.5.1 cells (Fig. 1G,I). In HCVcc J339EM, NS5A was fused with EGFP that was expressed along HCV replication. Of note, the percentage of GFP positive cells was in good linearity to HCV genome copies (Figure S1C), we routinely used the percentage of GFP+ cells to represent the replication efficiency of HCV in Huh7.5.1 cells. Finally, less QPRT would lead to a reduced consumption of its enzymatic substrate QA. Mass spectrometric analysis showed that QA concentration in the supernatant was indeed increased by ~9% at 72 h post HCV infection of Huh7.5.1 cells (Fig. 1J). Therefore, QPRT can be reduced by HCV infection, indicative of its role in regulation of HCV infection. It is thus desirable to delineate the biological significance of QPRT in regulation of HCV replication.
