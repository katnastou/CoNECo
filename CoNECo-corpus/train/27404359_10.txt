Shot localizes to the anterior and lateral cortex of the oocyte, but is absent from the posterior, following the predicted distribution of MT minus ends. Shot is also strongly enriched at the apical side of the epithelial follicle cells that surround the developing egg chamber (Figure 2A, left). YFP-tagged Shot expressed from a transgenic bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) rescuing construct shows an identical distribution in both the follicle cells and oocyte. We therefore examined whether the interaction of Shot with the oocyte cortex is under the control of the cortical Par proteins that control the polarity of the MT cytoskeleton. In par-1 mutant oocytes, MTs grow from the posterior cortex as well as the anterior/lateral cortex, and the MT cytoskeleton loses its asymmetry, whereas Par-1T786A, which has a uniform cortical distribution, abolishes all MT growth from the cortex. Shot responds to Par-1 activity in the same way as MTs: it extends around the posterior in the absence of Par-1, and is lost from the cortex in oocytes overexpressing Par-1T786A (Figures 2A and 2B). Thus, Shot is downstream of Par-1, consistent with it playing a role in MT minus-end localization.
