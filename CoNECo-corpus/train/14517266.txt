The comings and goings of nucleotide excision repair factors on damaged DNA.  
To understand the mechanism of nucleotide excision repair (NER), one of the major human DNA repair pathways, we have set up a DNA repair system in which a linear damaged DNA substrate is immobilized by its terminus. By isolating functionally active intermediate complexes, our data dissect the ordered arrival and displacement of NER factors in the progress of the dual incision step. We describe (i) the role of ATP in remodelling the NER-initiating complex of XPC/TFIIH/damaged DNA as a prerequisite for the recruitment of the next NER factors; (ii) the coordination between damage removal and DNA resynthesis and the release of XPC-HR23B, TFIIH and XPA upon arrival of XPG and XPF-ERCC1, respectively; (iii) how RPA remains associated with the excised DNA initiating the assembly of resynthesis factors such as PCNA; (iv) the recycling of XPC-HR23B, TFIIH and XPA in the NER; and the shuttling of TFIIH between NER and transcription. Thus, our findings define multiple functions of NER factors to explain the molecular basis of human NER disorders.
