Increased ubiquitin expression suppresses the cell cycle defect associated with the yeast ubiquitin conjugating enzyme, CDC34 (UBC3). Evidence for a noncovalent interaction between CDC34 and ubiquitin. 
The yeast ubiquitin (Ub) conjugating enzyme CDC34 plays a crucial role in the progression of the cell cycle from the G1 to S phase. In an effort to identify proteins that interact with CDC34 we undertook a genetic screen to isolate genes whose increased expression suppressed the cell cycle defect associated with the cdc34-2 temperature-sensitive allele. From this screen, the poly-Ub gene UBI4 was identified as a moderately strong suppressor. The fact that the overexpression of a gene encoding a single Ub protein could also suppress the cdc34-2 allele indicated that suppression was related to the increased abundance of Ub. Ub overexpression was found to suppress two other structurally unrelated cdc34 mutations, in addition to the cdc34-2 allele. In all three cases, suppression depended on the expression of Ub with an intact carboxyl terminus. Only the cdc34-2 allele, however, could be suppressed by Ub with an amino acid substitution at lysine 48 which is known to be involved in multi-Ub chain assembly. Genetic results showing allele specific suppression of cdc34 mutations by various Ub derivatives suggested a specific noncovalent interaction between Ub and CDC34. Consistent with this prediction, we have shown by chemical cross-linking the existence of a specific noncovalent Ub binding site on CDC34. Together, these genetic and biochemical experiments indicate that Ub suppression of these cdc34 mutations results from the combined contributions of Ub-CDC34 thiol ester formation and a noncovalent interaction between Ub and CDC34 and therefore suggest that the correct positioning of Ub on a surface of the ubiquitin conjugating enzyme is a requirement of enzyme function.
