Therefore, to understand the mechanism providing the anterograde bias to the bulk of ChAT movement and the impact of its presynaptic activity on the transport, we estimated interactions between ChAT and Kinesin-2 motor subunit in situ at different developmental stages. We also perturbed the cholinergic activity using pharmacological reagents and studied the effect on this transport. We used a high-sensitivity detector for data acquisition that enhanced the signal-to-noise ratio substantially as compared to the earlier report. The results indicate that a temporally-restricted association with Kinesin-2, during 77-78 hours after egg laying (AEL), throughout the neuron drives the episodic movement of the bulk of ChAT towards synapse. A step increase in the axonal levels of the motor during 77-78 h AEL and cholinergic activity enhanced the entry and anterograde flux of ChAT in axons. The bulk movement of ChAT appears to evolve from a restricted to a directed, facilitated diffusion during this period.
