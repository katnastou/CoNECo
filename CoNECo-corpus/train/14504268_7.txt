For these experiments, lysis was performed under low free Ca2+ conditions (5 mM EGTA). This was because there is evidence that interactions of Cdc31p with proteins other than Kar1p are less Ca2+ sensitive. In addition, interactions of spasmin with the spasmoneme, and centrin with a 350-kD protein in the Paramecium infraciliary lattice, are stable in the presence of EGTA. The proteins that copurified with ZCdc31p were of diverse function: Vps13p is involved membrane traffic, Thp1p is involved in mitotic recombination, and Hem15p is ferrochelatase. One protein of particular interest, Sfi1p, was initially identified as a suppressor of the heat sensitivity associated with a particular mutation in adenyl cyclase. When Sfi1p was partly characterized, it was found not to be involved in the adenyl cyclase pathway, but it is an essential protein whose depletion causes a G2/M arrest with failure to form a mitotic spindle. This is similar to the phenotype of cdc31-1, and indicates a possible function at the SPB.
