Each protein phospholipid pair generated by MD was treated as a candidate model. For example, ~105,000 such models were generated for AqpZ and filtered by comparison of calculated and experimental CCS values. More specifically, within each MD snapshot there are ~80 lipids that could be in accord with the CCS measurements for one lipid bound to AqpZ. After filtering by agreement with CCS, an ensemble of protein phospholipid complexes consistent with our data was identified. As the MD is used to provide a source of potential lipid associated structures, the results are largely invariant to the choice of force field and lipid molecule.
