The cataract-associated R14C mutant of human gamma D-crystallin shows a variety of intermolecular disulfide cross-links: a Raman spectroscopic study. 
The Arg14 to Cys (R14C) mutation in the human gammaD-crystallin (HGD) gene has been associated with a juvenile-onset hereditary cataract. We showed previously [Pande, A., et al. (2000) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 97, 1993-1998] that rapid oxidation of Cys14 in the mutant leads to the formation of intermolecular, disulfide-cross-linked aggregates at physiological pH. Here we present a Raman spectroscopic analysis of R14C and HGD and show that R14C forms such aggregates even at pH 4.5. The lower pH enabled us to monitor the evolution of a variety of disulfide cross-links with distinct conformations around the CC-SS-CC dihedral angles. At least three cysteine residues are involved, forming protein-protein cross-links through disulfide-exchange reactions. From the pattern of the S-S and Trp Raman bands, we infer that Cys32 is likely to be involved in the cross-linking. The data suggest that protein precipitation in the mutant may not be the direct result of disulfide cross-linking, although such cross-linking is the initiating event. Thus, our Raman data not only enhance the understanding of the reactivity of Cys14 in the R14C mutant and the mechanism of opacity, but also shed light on the mechanism of oxidative degradation during long-term storage of thiol-containing pharmaceuticals.
