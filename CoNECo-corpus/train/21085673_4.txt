In the past twenty years, numerous elements of ABA signaling have been identified, culminating with the recent establishment of a core ABA signaling pathway. Based on genetic studies, it was previously established that clade A Ser/Thr Protein Phosphatase 2Cs (PP2C), including ABI1, ABI2 and HAB1 are major negative regulators of ABA signaling. In contrast, the identification of the drought-sensitive Arabidopsis mutant ost1, also called srk2e, which does not close its stomata in response to ABA indicates that the ABA-activated Ser/Thr Snf1-Related Kinase 2 OST1/SRK2E/SnRK2.6 (hereafter called OST1), a homologue of Vicia faba AAPK, acts as positive regulator of ABA signaling in guard cells. In addition to OST1, the Arabidopsis genome encodes two other SnRK2s strongly activated by ABA, SnRK2.2 and SnRK2.3. While single mutants are not distinguishable from the wild type, the double mutant snrk2.2 snrk2.3 is insensitive to ABA inhibition of seed germination, root growth, and marker gene expression, but is not significantly affected in transpiration. This genetic analysis indicated that SnRK2.2 and SnRK2.3 are redundant positive regulator of ABA signaling principally acting outside of guard cells.
