Our experiments suggest a major function for MSP-300 both in promoting nuclear spacing (cooperatively with Klar) and in mediating anchoring of the nuclei as well as other organelles to the muscle core myofibrillar domain. The spectrin repeats domain is critical for this latter function, as most of it is eliminated in msp-300Delta3'. Similarly to other proteins containing the spectrin repeats domain, the multiple (52) spectrin repeats are likely to promote formation of MSP-300 dimers that form elongated filaments capable of connecting between different organelles and the cytoskeleton. In striated muscle, we suggest that such filaments connect between the various organelles and the Z-discs. The association of these filaments with the Z-discs requires the activity of d-Titin/Sallimus, another large protein that associates with the Z-discs. The function of the N-terminal domain of MSP-300 containing the calponin-homology (CH) actin-binding motifs is still elusive because of the early lethality of the homozygous mutants.
