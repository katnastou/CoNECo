Error-prone bypass of certain DNA lesions by the human DNA polymerase kappa.  
The Escherichia coli protein DinB is a newly identified error-prone DNA polymerase. Recently, a human homolog of DinB was identified and named DINB1. We report that the DINB1 gene encodes a DNA polymerase (designated polkappa), which incorporates mismatched bases on a nondamaged template with a high frequency. Moreover, polkappa bypasses an abasic site and N-2-acetylaminofluorene (AAF)-adduct in an error-prone manner but does not bypass a cis-syn or (6-4) thymine-thymine dimer or a cisplatin-adduct. Therefore, our results implicate an important role for polkappa in the mutagenic bypass of certain types of DNA lesions.
