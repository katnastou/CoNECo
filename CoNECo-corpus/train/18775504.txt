The CCT/TRiC chaperonin is required for maturation of sphingosine kinase 1.  
Sphingosine kinase 1 (SK1) catalyses the generation of sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P), a bioactive phospholipid that influences a diverse range of cellular processes, including proliferation, survival, adhesion, migration, morphogenesis and differentiation. SK1 is controlled by various mechanisms, including transcriptional regulation, and post-translational activation by phosphorylation and protein-protein interactions which can regulate both the activity and localisation of this enzyme. To gain a better understanding of the regulatory mechanisms controlling SK1 activity and function we performed a yeast two-hybrid screen to identify SK1-interacting proteins. Using this approach we identified that SK1 interacts with subunit 7 (eta) of cytosolic chaperonin CCT (chaperonin containing t-complex polypeptide, also called TRiC for TCP-1 ring complex), a hexadecameric chaperonin that binds unfolded polypeptides and mediates their folding and release in an ATP-dependent manner. Further analysis of the SK1-CCTeta interaction demonstrated that other CCT/TRiC subunits also associated with SK1 in HEK293T cell lysates in an ATP-sensitive manner, suggesting that the intact, functional, multimeric CCT/TRiC complex associated with SK1. Furthermore, pulse-chase studies indicated that CCT/TRiC binds specifically to newly translated SK1. Finally, depletion of functional CCT/TRiC through the use of RNA interference in HeLa cells or temperature sensitive CCT yeast mutants reduced cellular SK1 activity. Thus, combined this data suggests that SK1 is a CCT/TRiC substrate, and that this chaperonin facilitates folding of newly translated SK1 into its mature active form.
