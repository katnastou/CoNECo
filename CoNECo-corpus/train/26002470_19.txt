Upon our screen, we identify an ER-enriched v-SNARE protein Sec22 involved in Wg trafficking, and thus we generated two Sec22 mutants (Fig. 3 A). Consistent with the RNAi results, Wg protein accumulates significantly in the Sec22 homozygous mutant clones (Fig. 3 C). We fed Drosophila S2 cells with dsRNA of Sec22 and examined the Wg protein level in the supernatant and lysate. We observed a significant reduction of the secreted Wg in the supernatant and an increased level of Wg in the cell lysate (Fig. 3 B), indicating that depletion of Sec22 impedes Wg secretion.
