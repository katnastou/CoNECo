To determine if these large PopZ complexes exist in C. crescentus, we compared the mobility of PopZ in whole cell lysates of C. crescentus and E. coli cultures (expressing PopZ) with purified protein (Figure 6C). We found that the majority of PopZ in C. crescentus cells is the same size as the major band in E. coli, indicating that the high molecular weight PopZ complex is a physiologically relevant form. In the whole cell lysates, we observed an additional band (excluded from our preparations of purified PopZ during size exclusion chromatography) that is approximately half the size of the major band, suggesting that PopZ complex assembly has at least one stable alternate or intermediate form. Since we were unable to detect monomeric PopZ in whole cell lysates, we propose that PopZ is synthesized and assembled into small oligomers (approximately 325 kDa and 650 kDa) in the cytoplasm. We examined the effects of inhibiting MreB activity on the formation of PopZ oligomers, and found that the depletion of MreB from C. crescentus (Fig 6C, compare lanes 4 and 5) and the addition of A22 to E. coli (compare lanes 2 and 3) did not affect the PopZ oligomerization state in whole cell lysates, suggesting that PopZ oligomerization is independent of polar accumulation.
