Genomic organization and transcription of the human retinol dehydrogenase 10 (RDH10) gene.  
A cDNA clone up-regulated in hydraulic lung edema in rabbit showed high similarity with human RDH10 mRNA, which encodes a protein involved in retinoic acid metabolism. We defined the organization of the human gene, which includes a unique transcriptional start site, a coding region with six translated exons and a 3' untranslated region containing at least two used polyadenylation sites. The two poly(A) signals are responsible for the production of the 3 and 4 kb RDH10 mRNA isoforms detected in several human tissues and cell lines.
