The cytosolic domains of Tom70 and Tom20 (Tom70CD and Tom20CD) were recombinantly expressed and purified as previously described. For binding studies, Tom70CD and Tom20CD were bound to Ni-NTA agarose and incubated with 35S-Ugo1 precursor in import buffer containing 0.2% BSA for 40 min at 4degreesC. After excessive washing, bound proteins were eluted with 500 mM imidazole in lysis buffer and subjected to SDS-PAGE. Bound proteins were detected by Coomassie staining and autoradiography.
