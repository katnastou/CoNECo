To further specify the effects caused by K270R expression, endogenous Syn5 was depleted by RNA interference (RNAi), which resulted in Golgi fragmentation (Fig. S6A-G), and then RNAi-resistant WT or mutant Syn5 was expressed to rescue the phenotype. As shown in Fig. 5D-E, WT Syn5 and K241R, but not K270R, rescued the fragmented Golgi phenotype. Depletion of endogenous Syn5 resulted in Golgi fragmentation in over 80% of the cells; expression of RNAi-resistant WT or K241R Syn5 reduced this number to about 20%. In contrast, expression of the K270R mutant had no effect on the fragmented Golgi phenotype in Syn5-depleted cells (Fig. 5D-E). In this experiment, all proteins were expressed at a similar level (Fig. 5F). These results demonstrate that monoubiquitination of Syn5 on lysine 270 is required for assembly of the Golgi structure.
