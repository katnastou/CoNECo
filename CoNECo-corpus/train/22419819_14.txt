To analyze the biogenesis of Tom40, we incubated the 35S-labeled precursor with isolated mitochondria. We used the wild-type precursor of Tom40 and two mutant forms of Ser-54. When serine was replaced by alanine, the binding of Tom40 to mitochondria was only mildly affected compared with the wild-type precursor (Figure 3A, lanes 4-9). When serine was replaced by the phosphomimetic residue glutamate, however, binding of Tom40 to mitochondria was reduced (Figure 3A, lanes 1-3). Treatment of mitochondria with sodium carbonate at alkaline pH leads to the extraction of soluble and peripheral membrane proteins, whereas integral membrane proteins remain in the membrane sheets. Mitochondria were incubated with [35S]Tom40 and then treated at alkaline pH, demonstrating that the replacement of Ser-54 by glutamate considerably reduced the membrane integration of Tom40 (Figure 3B, lanes 1-3).
