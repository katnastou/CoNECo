There are several lines of evidence that support the view that the KLC1 mutation we made is functionally null with respect to the phenotypes observed, in spite of the presence of a KLC1 fragment of low abundance. First, Western blots of brain tissue from mutant animals suggest that only a very small amount of the KLC1 fragment relative to wild-type KLC1 is present. Second, immunofluorescence of sensory and motor neuron cell bodies in DRG and spinal cord reveals only faintly detectable staining of the KLC1 fragment relative to the robust staining ordinarily seen in wild-type. Third, immunoprecipitation experiments from whole brain provide no evidence for the association of the KLC1 fragment with KIF5A or KIF5B. Fourth, the sites of aberrant accumulation of KIF5A or KIF5B in DRG or spinal cord do not exhibit costaining with KLC antibodies in mutants, suggesting that the aberrantly behaving KHC chains do so as a result of the absence of KLC, rather than an active influence of the KLC1 fragment. Fifth, the overall abundance of KIF5A and KLC2 are unchanged, even though KLC1 has been removed. Thus, there appears to be a larger than normal pool of KIF5A lacking associated KLC, a suggestion that was confirmed by sucrose gradient analysis. Sixth, heterozygotes are normal with respect to all phenotypes we observed, suggesting that the fragment does not actively exert cellular effects. It remains formally possible that the low abundance KLC1 fragment does have some residual function, but if so, we have failed to detect it.
