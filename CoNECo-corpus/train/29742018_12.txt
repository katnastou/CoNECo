To ascertain the functionality of the C-terminal truncation mutants of Hhp1/2, we performed growth, in vitro kinase, and mitotic checkpoint assays. First, we found that each of the hhp1/2 C-terminal truncation mutants integrated as the sole hhp1/2 allele in cells rescued the severe growth defect of the double-deletion mutant in vivo (Figure 2D). Consistent with this finding and previous reports, recombinant Hhp1/2 C-terminal truncation mutants phosphorylated the exogenous substrate casein in vitro even more robustly than the full-length proteins (Figure 2E). Importantly, we found that the truncation mutants were sufficient to inhibit the SIN during the mitotic checkpoint. GFP-tagged Hhp1 and Hhp2 C-terminal truncations accumulated at SPBs during a mitotic checkpoint arrest (Supplemental Figure S2, C and D), and Sid4 was appropriately ubiquitinated (Figure 2F). Taken together, these data indicate that the C-termini of Hhp1/2 are dispensable for their SPB localization and function during the Dma1-mediated mitotic checkpoint.
