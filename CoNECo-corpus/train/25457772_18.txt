The above results confirmed a substantially more severe Lif1 interaction defect with D800K or GG(868:869)AA Dnl4 mutations than with KTT(742:744)ATA. To further explore the ability of these mutants to complete NHEJ, we extended the HO suicide deletion screen results to a different suicide deletion assay based on the I-SceI endonuclease. In this system, it was again true that the KTT(742:744)ATA mutant had a more substantial NHEJ defect than D800K or GG(868:869)AA (Figure 4A). The more focused mutations in K742A and T744A suggested that K742 is a more important residue in the cluster than T744, although the T744A mutant was still partially NHEJ deficient (Figure 4A). The partially penetrant phenotype of D800K and GG(868:869)AA mutants was reinforced by the observation that NHEJ activity with the D800K,GG(868:869)AA compound mutant was undetectable and equivalent to dnl4Delta and the C-terminal truncations that eliminated the inter-BRCT linker (e.g. L750*, Figure 4A).
