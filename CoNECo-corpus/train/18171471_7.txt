These studies raise an interesting question of whether the two paxillin-binding sites of FAK are simply redundant interaction surfaces that strengthen the association between these two proteins, or alternatively, whether paxillin binding to each site might mediate a distinct function. To address these important questions, site-directed mutagenesis was used to disrupt binding to the alpha-helix 2/3 paxillin-binding site (E949A/K956A/R963A or EKR) or to the alpha-helix 1/4 paxillin-binding site (I937A). Combining these mutations together (E949A/K956A/R963A/I937A or EKR/I937A) completely abolished paxillin binding as demonstrated in vitro by GST pulldown and in vivo by co-immunoprecipitation as previously reported. These mutants have been characterized to determine the role of paxillin binding to each site individually in the regulation of FAK.
