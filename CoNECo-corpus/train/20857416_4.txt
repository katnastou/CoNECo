RA promotes epigenetic changes. RA treatment of ES cells decreases H3k27me3 and increases H3k4me3 marks. Moreover, RA displaces Suz12 from some of RA response elements (RAREs) in F9 cells. Suz12, a member of Polycomb Repressive Complex-2 (PRC2) involved in H3K27me3 methylation and in maintaining ES cell self-renewal, is a powerful repressor of homeobox (Hox) gene expression. Hox gene clusters are expressed during ES cell differentiation and transcriptionally activated by RA.
