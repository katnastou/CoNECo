We have previously shown that the third PHD finger of MLL interacts with Cyp33/PPIE, an RNA binding nuclear cyclophilin. Cyp33 enhances the recruitment of HDAC1 to the MLL repression domain and down-regulates expression of the HOXC8 gene in an MLL dependent manner. This indicates that Cyp33 may contribute to the intrinsic repression potential of MLL. The MLL repression domain, Cyp33, and the PHD finger domain form a repression unit that contributes to the repression potential of MLL-N and balances the activation potential of MLL-C. In MLL-ENL, the loss of the PHD fingers disrupts this repression unit. Therefore, the intrinsic repression potential is compromised, and in the presence of an activation domain on the partner protein, the MLL-ENL fusion functions as a dominant constitutive activator of MLL target HOX genes.
