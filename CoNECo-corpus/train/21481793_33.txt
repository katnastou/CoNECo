To investigate whether Angiomotin is required for tumor development in vivo, we employed a mouse model of NF2 in which conditional deletion of Nf2 in mouse Schwann cells (P0-Cre:Nf2flox/flox) leads to schwannoma development, within a lag time of several months. To assess the requirement for Angiomotin in this model, we crossed the P0-Cre and P0-Cre:Nf2flox/flox to Amotflox/flox mice. While P0-Cre:Amotflox/flox mice are born at the expected Mendelian ratios and develop normally, the P0-Cre:Nf2flox/flox:Amotflox/flox mice die shortly after birth due to neurological defects (Yi and Kissil, unpublished results), precluding the use of this model.
