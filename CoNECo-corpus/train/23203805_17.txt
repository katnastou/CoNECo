Get3-GFP-positive foci are protein-rich, membrane- and ribosome-free deposits. (A-C) Examples of cryosections from glucose-starved and chemically fixed Deltaget1get2 double-deletion cells expressing Get3-GFP from its endogenous promoter. Cells were fixed after 60 minutes of glucose withdrawal as described for Fig. 1. The sections were immunolabeled with anti-GFP antibody and 10 nm gold particles conjugated to protein A. (D,E) Sections obtained after high-pressure freezing of glucose-starved (60 minutes) wild-type cells (wt-D) expressing Get3-GFP from the endogenous promoter. (F) Example of sections obtained after high-pressure freezing of Deltaget2 deletion cells expressing Get3-GFP from its endogenous promoter without exposing them to glucose starvation. ER, endoplasmic reticulum; pnER, perinuclear ER; N, nucleus; M, mitochondria; V, vacuole; LD, lipid droplet; PM, plasma membrane; CW, cell wall. White scale bars: 200 nm; black scale bar: 500 nm. Arrows indicate anti-GFP immuno-label to mark Get3-GFP.
