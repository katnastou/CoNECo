To simultaneously inhibit all HIF complexes, we considered targeting interactions between the ARNT subunit, shared among these complexes, with transcriptional coactivators. This strategy is predicated on the ARNT PAS-B domain (Fig. 1) directly recruiting coiled coil coactivators (CCCs) to HIF for proper transcriptional regulation. By depleting endogenous proteins or overexpressing mutants, we found that HIF complexes differentially utilize several CCC proteins including thyroid hormone receptor interacting protein 230 (TRIP230), Coiled-Coil Coactivator (CoCoA) and transforming acidic coiled-coil 3 (TACC3) at different promoters. Combining biophysical and mutagenesis data, we generated a structural model of the ARNT/TACC3 complex, showing that CCC proteins use a coiled coil to bind a helical surface on ARNT PAS-B (Fig. 1b). Notably, the CCC-binding surface on ARNT is near where other PAS domains bind cofactors that modulate their protein/protein interactions, leading us to hypothesize that artificial ARNT-binding compounds might similarly control ARNT PAS-B/CCC interactions to regulate HIF activity.
