Somatic mutations are the predominant cause of cell cycle dysregulation and unrestrained proliferation that occurs during the development of sporadic cancers. Recently, members of the apolipoprotein B mRNA editing enzyme catalytic polypeptide-like (APOBEC) family of cytidine deaminases have been identified as tumor-specific sources of DNA damage occurring in ~15% of human cancers. The catalytically active enzymes in this family, which include activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID), APOBEC1 and the seven APOBEC3 enzymes (A through H), all deaminate cytidines in single-strand (ss) DNA substrates resulting in cytidine (C) to thymidine (T) or C to guanidine (G) substitutions. Additionally, every active APOBEC family member except AID and APOBEC3G (A3G) deaminate cytidines specifically within TCW motifs (where the underlined C is deaminated and W = adenine (A) or T). This nucleotide editing capacity normally is used to tailor immunoglobulin affinities (AID), alter apolipoproteins involved in dietary lipid transport (APOBEC1) and as an anti-viral/retrotransposon innate immune response (APOBEC1 and APOBEC3).
