MMP mediated type V collagen degradation (C5M) is elevated in ankylosing spondylitis.  
OBJECTIVES: Type V collagen has been demonstrated to control fibril formation. The aim of this study was to develop an ELISA capable of detecting a fragment of type V collagen generated by MMP-2/9 and to evaluate the assay as biomarker for ankylosing spondylitis (AS). DESIGN AND METHODS: A fragment unique to type V collagen and generated by both MMP-2/9 cleaved at the amino acid position 1317 (C5M) was selected for ELISA development. 40 AS patients and 40 age-matched controls were evaluated. RESULTS: An ELISA detecting C5M with inter- and intra-assay variations of 9.1% and 4.4% was developed. C5M levels were significantly higher in AS patients compared to controls, 229% (p<0.0001). The diagnostic AUC was 83%. CONCLUSIONS: This ELISA is the first for detecting type V collagen degradation. AS patients had highly elevated levels of MMP mediated type V collagen degradation. The prognostic and diagnostic values need to be further investigated in additional clinical settings.
