To examine in more detail how the internal oxidation state of Pdi1p relates to oxidative refolding activity in our in vitro system, a polyethylene glycol (PEG)-trapping assay was exploited that, through alkylation of reduced cysteines, leads to defined shifts in apparent molecular weight. Analysis of PEG-treated Pdi1p over the course of the oxidative refolding reaction by Western blotting showed that within 100 s of RNase A refolding, the initially fully oxidized Pdi1p becomes heavily reduced with a prominent species appearing at a size expected for four reduced cysteines, as well as a less abundant species corresponding to six reduced cysteines, that is, fully reduced Pdi1p (Fig. 6A, B; Supplementary Figs. S2 and S3).
