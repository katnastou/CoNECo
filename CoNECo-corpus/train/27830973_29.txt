Given the effect of TRIM21 on Par-4 in response to cisplatin, we hypothesized that TRIM21 could contribute to cisplatin resistance. To address this question, we performed an MTT viability assay on HCT-116 cells that had either been transfected with TRIM21 plasmid or control plasmid, followed by treatment with increasing concentrations of cisplatin. The data show that TRIM21 decreases the sensitivity of HCT-116 cells to cisplatin (Fig. 8A). Specifically, HCT-116 cells had statistically significant increases in viability at cisplatin doses between 0.5-10 mug/ml, with a right shift in IC50 from approximately 5 mug/ml to 10 mug/ml between the control and TRIM21 transfected cells, respectively. Likewise, we performed an analogous experiment in Panc-1 cells, a pancreatic cancer cell line. To our surprise, ectopic TRIM21expression in Panc-1 cells had no effect on Panc-1 cell viability in response to cisplatin (data not shown). Despite that finding, we show in Fig. 8B that ectopic Par-4 expression sensitizes Panc-1 cells to cisplatin-induced apoptosis as indicated by PARP cleavage, specifically at the 15 and 30 mug/ml doses. PARP cleavage was examined by Western blotting and the percentage of the cleavage product was determined using densitometry. Densitometric analysis revealed that Par-4 overexpression increased the levels of apoptosis in Panc-1 cells by 2- to 3-fold relative to the control transfected cells at the 15 and 30 mug/ml doses of cisplatin (Fig. 8B).
