This study suggests that while the general pathways and enzymes for genome stability are similar across eukaryotes, the activities of specific DNA regulators have diverged within those modules. Among the SNF2-specific helicases, for example, metazoans have significantly expanded the family. Our data suggest that the helicase function of S. pombe Rad8 is potentially required under specialized circumstances, as a minor redundant pathway with the HR proteins most notably in the restart of replication forks in HU, or in the absence of ubiquitin-PCNA. The primary function of this enzyme in fission yeast in the maintenance of genome stability appears to be due to its E3 ubiquitin ligase activity and the HIRAN domain, indicating a fundamental role for PCNA modification in preserving genomic integrity.
