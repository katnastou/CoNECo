To test whether UvrB and Mfd proteins influence UvrA degradation we performed pulse-chase experiments in uvrB and mfd mutant cells and determined the rate of UvrA degradation at 40 min post-UV treatment. Deletion of either mfd or uvrB increased UvrA half-life from ~70 min in wild-type cells to ~150 min in the mfd mutant and to ~290 min in the uvrB mutant cells (Fig. 5B). The absence of Mfd or UvrB from the cells is expected to affect the kinetics of DNA repair and may also influence UvrA stability more directly, as both proteins are known to interact with UvrA.
