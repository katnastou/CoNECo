Germline inactivation of the VHL tumor suppressor gene is linked with development of von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) disease, an autosomal dominantly inherited cancer syndrome. VHL patients are predisposed to develop various vascular tumors, including hemangioblastomas of the retinas and central nervous system, clear cell RCC, pancreatic cysts and adenocarcinomas, and adrenal pheochromocytomas. The VHL gene is also inactivated in the majority of patients with sporadic clear cell RCC. The VHL gene encodes proteins (pVHL) of 25 and 19 kDa through use of alternative translation initiation codons, and both isoforms appear to possess tumor suppressor activity. pVHL has alpha and beta structural domains that are critical to its function as the substrate recognition component of a cullin-RING E3 ubiquitin ligase (CRL). The N-terminal beta domain is associated with target protein recognition, while the alpha domain contains a SOCS box that interacts with elongin C and links pVHL to the ubiquitin-ligase complex containing elongin B and C and Cul2. Perhaps the best characterized pVHL CRL targets are the alpha subunits of hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF). Hydroxylation of conserved prolines on HIFalpha subunits under normoxic (21% O2) conditions provides a substrate recognition motif for pVHL polyubiquitylation, and proteasomal degradation. In hypoxia (1% O2) prolyl hydroxylase activity is inhibited, unmodified HIFalpha subunits are stabilized, and the hypoxia response is initiated. We recently demonstrated that pVHL levels are suppressed in hypoxia, providing an additional mechanism for HIFalpha upregulation in hypoxia.
