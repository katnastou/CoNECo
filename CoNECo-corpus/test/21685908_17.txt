Our results suggest a two-step model for PFN delivery of Gzms in which PFN first forms transient pores in the cell membrane that trigger the target cell membrane repair response leading to coendocytosis of Gzms and PFN. PFN then forms larger, more stable, pores in the endosomal membrane to trigger release of Gzms. Although the experiments presented here used GzmB, we obtained similar results when the other major Gzm (GzmA) was substituted (data not shown). Therefore we expect this model applies to all the Gzms. This model, which suggests that PFN can form at least two types of pores of different size and stability, is supported by a recent study that measured conductance through various sorts of membranes (planar lipid bilayers and unilamellar vesicles of different lipid composition and size) treated with PFN. There was a good deal of heterogeneity in PFN pores; in particular formation of small, highly unstable pores preceded the development of more stable and larger pores with a distribution in size. Heterogeneous pore formation was confirmed by cryoelectron microscopy. We therefore hypothesize that the rapid membrane repair response interferes with the formation of larger pores on the plasma membrane, but that PFN multimerizes into larger stable pores on the gigantosome membrane that increase in size within 5-15 min after adding PFN. Based on the kinetics of early endosome acidification, our data suggest that the smaller pores form within the gigantosome membrane almost immediately to interfere with acidification and allow PFN to remain active.
