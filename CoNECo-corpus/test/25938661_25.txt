The RGMCND-BMP2 complex was solved by molecular replacement in PHASER using the structure of the disulfide bonded BMP2 dimer (PDB 3BMP) as a search model. Extra electron density for two molecules of RGMCND in the asymmetric unit was immediately discernible after density modification in PARROT (Supplementary Fig. 2a, b). The RGMC polypeptide chain was traced using iterative rounds of BUCCANEER, manual building in COOT and refinement in autoBUSTER and PHENIX. This resulted in a well-defined model for the RGMCND-BMP2 complex that included two molecules of RGMC (residues Q36-P129) bound to a disulfide linked BMP2 dimer (residues K293-R396) (Supplementary Fig. 2c). The RGMAND-BMP2 and RGMBND-BMP2 complexes were solved by molecular replacement using PHASER with the RGMCND-BMP2 complex as a search model. Molecular replacement with PHASER was applied to solve the BMP2-eRGMB-NEO1FN56 structure using the RGMBND-BMP2 Form 1 (from this study) and the NEO1FN56-RGMB (PDB ID. 4BQ6) structures. The complexes were refined using autoBUSTER and PHENIX and, where applicable, non-crystallographic restraints were applied. For the BMP2-eRGMB-NEO1FN56 structure target weight refinement using the individual high resolution structures of the BMP2, RGMBND, eRGMB, NEO1FN5 and NEO1FN6 domains as targets was applied. Crystallographic statistics are given in Table 1. Stereochemical properties were assessed by MOLPROBITY. Superpositions were calculated using the program COOT and electrostatic potentials were generated using APBS as implemented in PYMOL. Buried surface areas of protein-protein interactions were calculated using the PISA webserver for a probe radius of 1.4 Aa.
