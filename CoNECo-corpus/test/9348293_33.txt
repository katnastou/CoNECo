An interesting property of plakoglobin is that it binds to both classical and desmosomal cadherins. The observation that DP-NTP binds to plakoglobin and clusters desmosomal cadherin-plakoglobin complexes implies that desmoplakin binds to plakoglobin that is associated with the desmosomal cadherin cytoplasmic domain. In contrast, plakoglobin that is associated with the desmosomal cadherin cytoplasmic domain is unable to bind to alpha-catenin (Fig. 8). Recent studies have demonstrated that the alpha-catenin and Dsg1 binding sites on plakoglobin overlap in the amino-terminal armadillo repeats of plakoglobin, suggesting that Dsg1 and alpha-catenin cannot bind to the same plakoglobin molecule simultaneously. However, the classical cadherins bind to the central armadillo repeats of plakoglobin, leaving the amino-terminal armadillo repeats of plakoglobin available to bind alpha-catenin. In the present study, deletion mutants of plakoglobin lacking either the amino- or carboxyl-terminal domain co-immunoprecipitated with DP-NTP and were clustered in L-cells co-expressing DP-NTP. These results, along with the ability of the amino-terminal plakoglobin deletion to interact with DP-NTP in the two hybrid system, suggest that desmoplakin may bind to the central armadillo repeats of plakoglobin. In A431 cells, the expression of plakoglobin deletion mutants lacking the amino- and carboxyl-terminal end domains promoted the assembly of elongated and fused desmosomes, suggesting that the central armadillo repeats of plakoglobin can promote interactions between desmosomal proteins, which may include desmoplakin. Future studies will be directed at mapping precisely where desmoplakin binds to plakoglobin in relation to the sites on plakoglobin that bind to the desmosomal cadherins. Such studies should provide insight into the mechanisms by which the cadherin cytoplasmic tails govern the domains on plakoglobin that are available for interactions with either alpha-catenin or desmoplakin.
