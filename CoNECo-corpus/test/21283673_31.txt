As is the case with bur2Delta cells, deletion of DST1, LEO1, or SPT4 renders cells sensitive to 6-AU, thus indicating their roles in regulating transcription. To determine whether U2 snRNA alleles affect the 6-AU sensitivity of these strains we tested the growth of the double mutants on medium containing 6-AU. Alterations in the U2 snRNA secondary structure failed to produce significant changes in the 6-AU sensitivity of these strains (data not shown and Table 1). Taken together, the genetic analyses summarized in Table 1 suggest that neither CUS2 nor the U2 snRNA conformation mutants exhibit functional overlap with transcription factors that interact with the CDK complexes.
