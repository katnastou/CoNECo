The Saccharomyces cerevisiae Cdc14 phosphatase is implicated in the structural organization of the nucleolus. 
Cdc14, a dual-specificity protein phosphatase, has been previously implicated in triggering exit from mitosis in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Using immunofluorescence microscopy and immunogold labeling, we demonstrate that a functional HA-tagged version of the phosphatase Cdc14 localizes to the nucleolus. Moreover, Cdc14-HA co-localized with the nucleolar NOP2 and GAR1 proteins. By immunofluorescence, Cdc14-HA was found in the nucleolus during most of the mitotic cell cycle, except during anaphase-telophase when it redistributed along the mitotic spindle. While this work was in progress, the same pattern of Cdc14 localization was described by others (Visintin et al, Nature 398 (1999) 818). Constitutive overexpression of CDC14 was toxic and led to cell cycle arrest of cells, mainly in G1. This correlated with the appearance of abnormal nuclear structures. A genetic search for suppressors of the lethality associated with CDC14 overexpression identified YJL076W. Because overproduction of Yj1076w buffered the toxic effect of Cdc14 overproduction, this suggested that it might be a substrate of Cdc14. This has indeed been found to be the case by others who recently described Yj1076w/Netl as a nucleolar protein that physically associates with Cdc14 (Shou et al, Cell 97 (1999) 233). The present data confirm several recently uncovered aspects of the regulation of Cdc14 localization and activity and suggest that the level of expression of CDC14 influences the structural organization of the nucleolus.
