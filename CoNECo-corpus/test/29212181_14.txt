In an established model of metastatic lung cancer, H460 cells with IGF2BP3 overexpression were injected into the tail vein of nude mice. Animals were sacrificed at day 21 and the lungs were resected and photographed. The number of tumor nodules in lungs was significantly enhanced in IGF2BP3 overexpressing group compared with control group (Figure 4A and 4B). In agreement with the subcutaneous lung cancer model, IGF2BP3 overexpressing group in the metastatic lung cancer model also showed reduced survival rate (Figure 4C). To support this, we also analyzed the survival rate of lung cancer patients by an online tool "Kaplan-Meier Plotter" analysis (http://kmplot.com/analysis/). As shown in Figure 4D, lung cancer patients with high expression of IGF2BP3 had shorter survival rate compared to those with low expression of IGF2BP3.Thus, both in vitro and in vivo assays suggest that overexpression of IGF2BP3 promotes proliferation, metastasis and tumorigenicity of lung cancer cells.
