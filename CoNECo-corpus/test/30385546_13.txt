The screen highlighted 9 loci in IKZF3 ZF2 whose amino acid identities were critical for degradation (Fig. 3, B and C, and fig. S3, C and D). These loci again included residues that maintain the tertiary ZF fold (IKZF3 C148, C151, F155, L161, H164, H168) and the beta-hairpin glycine residue (IKZF3 G152). In addition, the screen highlighted two non-structural residues (IKZF3 Q147 and A153) that varied among the other ZF degrons (Fig. 3A), but were important for degradation of the IKZF3 ZF2 reporter (Fig. 3, B and C). Mutation of these two residues impaired degradation in validation experiments, whereas N149, a residue that was not highlighted in the mutagenesis screen, tolerated mutation (Fig. 3D). These data show that in addition to the residues maintaining the ZF fold, non-structural amino acids (IKZF3 Q147, G152 and A153) contribute to degron specificity.
