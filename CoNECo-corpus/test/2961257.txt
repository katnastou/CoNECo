Glycogen debranching enzyme: purification, antibody characterization, and immunoblot analyses of type III glycogen storage disease.  
Type III glycogen storage disease is caused by a deficiency of glycogen debranching-enzyme activity. Many patients with this disease have both liver and muscle involvement, whereas others have only liver involvement without clinical or laboratory evidence of myopathy. To improve our understanding of the molecular basis of the disease, debranching enzyme was purified 238-fold from porcine skeletal muscle. In sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis the purified enzyme gave a single band with a relative molecular weight of 160,000 that migrated to the same position as purified rabbit-muscle debranching enzyme. Antiserum against porcine debranching enzyme was prepared in rabbit. The antiserum reacted against porcine debranching enzyme with a single precipitin line and demonstrated a reaction having complete identity to those of both the enzyme present in crude muscle and the enzyme present in liver extracts. Incubation of antiserum with purified porcine debranching enzyme inhibited almost all enzyme activity, whereas such treatment with preimmune serum had little effect. The antiserum also inhibited debranching-enzyme activity in crude liver extracts from both pigs and humans to the same extent as was observed in muscle. Immunoblot analysis probed with anti-porcine-muscle debranching-enzyme antiserum showed that the antiserum can detect debranching enzyme in both human muscle and human liver. The bands detected in human samples by the antiserum were the same size as the one detected in porcine muscle. Five patients with Type III and six patients with other types of glycogen storage disease were subjected to immunoblot analysis. Although anti-porcine antiserum detected specific bands in all liver and muscle samples from patients with other types of glycogen storage disease (Types I, II, and IX), the antiserum detected no cross-reactive material in any of the liver or muscle samples from patients with Type III glycogen storage disease. These data indicate (1) immunochemical similarity of debranching enzyme in liver and muscle and (2) that deficiency of debranching-enzyme activity in Type III glycogen storage disease is due to absence of debrancher protein in the patients that we studied.
