To screen for correct formation and localization of the septum, we stained the cells with Calcofluor, together with DAPI to visualize the nuclei. Figure 3D shows the fraction of normally dividing, septated cells with normal septa at 25degreesC (t = 0), and at times after transfer to the restrictive temperature for overexpression of three of the mutants. At t = 0 nearly all septa were normal. After 4 hours, ~30% of the cells with 'vector only' had normal septa. In cells over-expressing wildtype or mutant Cdc8p, after 4 hours there were ~50% normal septa reflecting the residual ts phenotype (multiple, poorly organized septa and abnormal morphologies). After 17-24 hours, almost no cdc8-27 cells were normal; most had >2 nuclei, abnormal and multiple septa, and were branched. By 17 hours most cells expressing wildtype and E104A had normal septa while D16A and R121A.D131A.E138A had an elevated fraction of cells with an abnormal morphology and number of septa (Figure 3D). Certain other mutants divided normally based on nuclear number, yet had a higher percentage of abnormalities including shape, position or number of septa (E6A, D16A, E107A.R110A, for example; Table S3 in File S1). Two mutants (E82A, V114S.E117A.H118A) were so variable from one transformation to the next that we did not report values in Table S3 in File S1. In general, however, overexpression of mutant Cdc8p had poor penetrance; most cells were morphologically similar to wildtype.
