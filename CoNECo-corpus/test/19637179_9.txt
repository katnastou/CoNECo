Dvl is a critical regulator of Wnt signaling pathways. In the canonical Wnt signaling pathway, Wnt signal is passed from the membrane Wnt receptor Fz to Dvl, which then relays the signal to downstream components. The direct recognition between Dvl PDZ domain and a conserved sequence (KTXXXW) in Fz, localized two residues after the seventh transmembrane domain, is the key interaction in the pathway. Indeed, Dvl PDZ-binding peptides as well as small molecules targeting the Dvl PDZ domain can effectively block Wnt signaling. Here we show that sulindac and sulindac sulfone bind the peptide-binding site of the Dvl PDZ domain with an affinity comparable to that of the native binding partners and that, like other Dvl PDZ inhibitors, sulindac blocks Wnt signaling at the Dvl level in Xenopus. Therefore, we propose that sulindac exerts its chemoprotective anticancer effect not only by inhibiting COX enzymes but also by inhibiting Wnt signaling via Dvl.
