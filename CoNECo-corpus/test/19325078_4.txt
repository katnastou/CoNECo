While characterizing the structural requirements for Fra-mediated axon attraction, we observed that neuronal expression of a dominant negative form of Fra (FraDeltaC) leads to a dose-dependent "commissureless" phenotype. Searching for candidate genes that modify this phenotype, we found that removing one copy of comm enhances the midline crossing defects caused by expressing UASFraDeltaC (fig. S1), suggesting a role for Fra in regulating Comm during midline guidance. Consistent with this idea, removing one copy of comm in hypomorphic fra mutants increases the commissural defects as shown by thin or missing commissures in many segments, as well as an increased frequency of non-crossing defects in a subset of commissural neurons: the eagle neurons (Fig. 1 and Table S1). Similar genetic interactions are also observed using additional alleles of both fra and comm (fig. S2 and Table S1). These dose-dependent genetic interactions suggest that fra and comm may function in the same pathway to control commissural axon guidance.
