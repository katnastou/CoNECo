SOCS/CIS protein inhibition of growth hormone-stimulated STAT5 signaling by multiple mechanisms.  
The inhibition of growth hormone (GH) signaling by five members of the GH-inducible suppressor of cytokine signaling (SOCS/CIS) family was investigated in transfected COS cells. Complete inhibition of GH activation of the signal transducer STAT5b and STAT5b-dependent transcriptional activity was observed upon expression of SOCS-1 or SOCS-3, while partial inhibition (CIS, SOCS-2) or no inhibition (SOCS-6) was seen with other SOCS/CIS family members. SOCS-1, SOCS-2, SOCS-3, and CIS each strongly inhibited the GH receptor (GHR)-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation of JAK2 seen at low levels of transfected JAK2; however, only SOCS-1 strongly inhibited the GHR-independent tyrosine phosphorylation of JAK2 seen at higher JAK2 levels. To probe for interactions with GHR, in vitro binding assays were carried out using glutathione S-transferase-GHR fusion proteins containing variable lengths of GHR's COOH-terminal cytoplasmic domain. CIS and SOCS-2 bound to fusions containing as few as 80 COOH-terminal GHR residues, provided the fusion protein was tyrosine-phosphorylated. By contrast, SOCS-3 binding required tyrosine-phosphorylated GHR membrane-proximal sequences, SOCS-1 binding was tyrosine phosphorylation-independent, and SOCS-6 did not bind the GHR fusion proteins at all. Mutation of GHR's membrane-proximal tyrosine residues 333 and 338 to phenylalanine suppressed the inhibition by SOCS-3, but not by CIS, of GH signaling to STAT5b. SOCS/CIS proteins can thus inhibit GH signaling to STAT5b by three distinct mechanisms, distinguished by their molecular targets within the GHR-JAK2 signaling complex, as exemplified by SOCS-1 (direct JAK2 kinase inhibition), SOCS-3 (inhibition of JAK2 signaling via membrane-proximal GHR tyrosines 333 and 338), and CIS and SOCS-2 (inhibition via membrane-distal tyrosine(s)).
