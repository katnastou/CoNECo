The cDNA encoding RCD1 was cloned into the bait vector pGBT9 and the Rap2.4a cDNA into the prey vector pACT2. Double transformants of the yeast strain HF7c showed protein-protein interaction by complementation of the histidine auxotrophy of the yeast strain. On 20 mM 3-AT, which increases the stringency by inhibiting histidine biosynthesis, the double transformant grew almost as good as the commonly used positive control, pVA-pTD1 double transformants (Figure 4 left) (Li et al.,). The pAct2-Rap2.4a-empty pGBT9 double transformants (negative control) did not grow.
