The SpMyh1-Chimera construct was derived from pET11a-SpMyh1. First, the QuikChange XL Site-Directed Mutagenesis Kit (Stratagene) was used to create a SalI restriction enzyme cut site within the Spmyh1+ gene using primers, SpMyh-Sal-F and SpMyh-Sal-R. The SalI site was created immediately 3' to the segment of DNA that encodes for the SpMyh1 IDC region and immediately 5' to the segment of DNA that encodes for the SpMyh1 C-terminal domain. The pET11a-SpMyh1-SalI mutagenesis product was digested with NdeI and SalI and the digested DNA fragment containing the pET11a vector and the DNA encoding for the C-terminal domain of SpMyh1 (pET11a-CTDSpMyh1) was gel purified. Simultaneously, PCR was completed to amplify DNA containing a 5'-NdeI cut site and the 5'-end of the Spmyh1+ gene up to the beginning of the section of DNA that encodes for the SpMyh1 linker region with primers SpMyh-NdeI and SpMyh-SalI. The SpMyh-SalI primer used in the PCR reaction included DNA to synthesize the specified section of Spmyh1+, the E. coli MutY linker region, and a SalI cut site. This PCR product was digested with NdeI and SalI and ligated into the NdeI-SalI digested pET11a-CTDSpMyh1. Using the QuikChange XL Site-Directed Mutagenesis Kit (Stratagene) and primers, SpCHIM-Sal-to-Nat-F and SpCHIM-Sal-to-Nat-R, mutagenesis was completed again to remove the SalI site. The pET11a-SpMyh1-Chimera construct was used as a template for subcloning into the pLM303 vector.
