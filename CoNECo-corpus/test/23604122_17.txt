With the discovery of the diverse functions of RNA transcripts, increasing interest has been placed upon the role of alternative splicing in tumor progression. Although neoplastic tissues have been reported to display a perturbation in mRNA isoform expression compared to matched normal tissues, the precise role of this altered transcriptome and splicing pattern in tumorigenesis remains uncertain. Previously, it was shown that the metastasis suppressor Nm23-H1 regulates changes in the expression of RNA post-transcriptional modification proteins, including Gemin5, a component of the spliceosome. Yet, a direct role for metastasis modifiers in splicing has not yet been reported, although it seems that many factors involved in splicing have a variety of cellular functions. Here, using RNA-seq in combination with other biochemical methods, the metastasis modifier RRP1B has been demonstrated to directly regulate alternative isoform expression. This suggests that alternative splicing, and the diverse isoforms generated from that process, may play a role in the regulation of various factors implicated in metastasis.
