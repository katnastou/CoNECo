Deletion analysis indicated that a sizable segment, residues 1-383 at the N-terminus, could be removed, along with a shorter segment at the C-terminus, to yield a core region that is active in V(D)J recombination in vitro and in cells. Despite being recognized for years, the function of the N-terminal region remains mysterious. Its existence is conserved through the evolution of RAG1, yet it clearly is not needed for the central enzymatic role as a recombinase. Sequence alignments show that this region exhibits a greater divergence through evolution than the enzymatic core. Notable in such alignments is the absolute conservation of a cluster of cystine and histidine residues recognized as a special zinc-binding motif termed a 'RING finger'. RING structures have been found in enzymes (E3 ligases) that help modify other proteins through the covalent addition of small modifier proteins. In biochemical assays, the RAG1 N-terminus can act as an E3 ubiquitin ligase.
