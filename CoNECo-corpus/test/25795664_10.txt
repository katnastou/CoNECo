To gain new functional insights into Brc1 we carried out an E-MAP analysis to quantify the genetic interactions between brc1Delta and a S. pombe gene deletion library of nonessential genes. E-MAP values were determined with a simple growth phenotype that measures negative (aggravating) interactions, such as synthetic sick/lethal (SSL) interactions, as well as positive (alleviating) interactions in which the double mutant is healthier than would be expected based on the growth of the two single mutants. An SSL interaction often identifies proteins that function in distinct but parallel pathways, whereas a positive interaction score may indicate either suppression or masking effects, in which loss of one gene masks the effect of losing another, as seen when two proteins act together in a common complex or pathway.
