Domain organization of Drosophila melanogaster GW182, Hs TNRC6C and the corresponding chimeric proteins. ABD, AGO-binding domain; ABD2, AGO-binding domain from Caenorhabditis elegans AIN-2; NED, N-terminal effector domain; UBA, ubiquitin associated-like domain; QQQ, region rich in glutamine; Mid, middle region containing the PAM2 motif (dark blue), which divides the Mid region into the M1 and M2 regions; RRM, RNA recognition motif; C-term, C-terminal region; SD, silencing domain. The position of the conserved CIM-1, CIM-2 and P-GL motifs are indicated. Amino acid positions at domain boundaries are indicated below the protein outlines. Vertical red lines indicate the positions of GW repeats. Vertical green lines indicate the positions of tryptophan residues in the M2 region that are involved in NOT1-binding. Sequence alignments of the PAM2, CIM-1, CIM-2 and P-GL motifs and the amino acids mutated in this study are shown in Supplementary Figure S7.
