We next followed the vesicular movement of full-length Serp-GFP, and found that it was associated with the Rab9-positive endosomal membrane, and some of the Serp-GFP was concentrated at the Rab9-enriched domains (white arrowheads in Fig. 5f). Importantly, the Serp puncta colocalized with small GFP-Rab9 vesicles that were budding from larger endosomes (blue arrowheads in Fig. 5f).
