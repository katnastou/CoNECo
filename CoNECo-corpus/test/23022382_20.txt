The NDP52 CLIR was disordered in crystals of apo-NDP52 but became structured in the 2.5 Aa complex structure of NDP52 bound to LC3C (Figure 4B). Similar to other LC3-LIR complexes and to SUMO-SIM interactions, the CLIR forms a short beta strand (Figure 4B) that fits into the canonical, hydrophobic LIR binding groove of LC3C (Figures 4C and 4D). As expected from the NMR data and mutational analysis (Figure 3), the interaction is driven by extensive hydrophobic interactions of Leu134, Val135, and Val136.
