While HOT1 localizes to a subset of telomeres together with shelterin components, our HOT1 immunoprecipitation experiments failed to establish any putative association between HOT1 and shelterin complex members. Likewise, we could not retrieve HOT1 after a POT1-IP, which is in agreement with several other studies that searched for shelterin-associated factors either by immunoprecipitation or by bimolecular fluorescence complementation. Our comparison of the cocrystal structures of telomeric DNA with the HOT1, TRF1 and TRF2 homeodomains indicates that while HOT1 is shifted 'down' in 5'-->3' direction by one base towards the following telomeric repeat, the binding sites are largely overlapping. Hence, it is intriguing how these proteins coexist at telomeres, how they compete for binding sites and whether the shelterin proteins are found interspersed on telomeres or whether there are discrete, mutually exclusive patches along the telomeric tracts. This might further contribute to answering the question how HOT1 is selectively restricted to a subset of telomeres.
