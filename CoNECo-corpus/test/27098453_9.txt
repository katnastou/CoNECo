Morpholino oligonucleotides, mRNA, and plasmids were injected into two animal dorsal blastomeres at the eight-cell stage for observation of embryo phenotypes and RT-PCR analysis, into four animal blastomeres for western blot analysis, or into two ventral blastomeres at the four-cell stage for RT-PCR analysis. The cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions were prepared as described with modifications 23. Quantitative RT-PCR analysis: Total RNA was prepared using TRIzol (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) from the injected region at the gastrula or neurula stage. cDNA synthesis was carried out using Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). The sequences of the primer pairs were previously reported 24, 25, 26 and as follows: xWDR26: Forward 5'-ATGGCAACCTGCTTGACTCC-3'; Reverse 5'-ACAGTACCGTCGTCAGAAGC-3'. hWDR26: Forward 5'-CCGGAACTCGCCTGCTTGTC-3'; Reverse 5'-TGACATCCTCATCTGACTGG-3'. Xnr3: Forward 5'-CTTCTGCACTAGATTCTG-3'; Reverse 5'-CAGCTTCTGGCCAAGACT-3'. Xtwn: Forward 5'-AACCCAAGAAGGCGACACTATC-3'; Reverse 5'-GTGCCGATGGTAGGAAATGATC-3'. Xenopus embryonic ornithine decarboxylase (xODC) was used for normalization of cDNA samples.
