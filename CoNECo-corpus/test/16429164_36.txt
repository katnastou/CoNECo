In the standard halo assay, minimal medium with allantoin (MMA) is supplemented with 30 mug/ml leucine to induce PTR2 expression (MMA+Leu medium). Under these conditions, wild-type strains varied substantially in sensitivity to Ala-Eth toxicity (Figure 7). S288c was the most sensitive to the dipeptide, whereas W303 was completely resistant. In the absence of the leucine inducer, only the clinical isolates YAT17 and YAT21 were sensitive to Ala-Eth (Figure 7).
