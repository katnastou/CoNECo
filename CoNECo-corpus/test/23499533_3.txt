Cohesin is highly enriched throughout the pericentromere, yet the Scc2/4 cohesin loader shows strong enrichment only within the core ~125 bp centromere (see Figures S1A and S1B available online). Enrichment of Scc2 at centromeres, but not at a control tRNA site, requires Ctf19 complex components (Figures S1C and S1D). Scc2 turns over rapidly near kinetochores and does not stably associate with the Ctf19 complex (Figures S1E, S1F, and Table S3). Even when the Ctf19 complex was purified from cells producing a version of Smc3 (Smc3E1155Q) blocked at an early step in cohesin loading, virtually the entire kinetochore, yet only very few peptides of cohesin and its loader, were recovered (Figure S1E and Table S3). These data suggest that the Ctf19 complex promotes cohesin enrichment throughout the pericentromere by enabling the transient association of the Scc2/4 cohesin loader with centromeres.
