A single STAT recruitment module in a chimeric cytokine receptor complex is sufficient for STAT activation.  
We established a system of receptor chimeras that enabled us to induce heterodimerization of different cytoplasmic tails. Fusion constructs were created that are composed of the extracellular parts of the interleukin-5 receptor alpha and beta chains, respectively, and the transmembrane and intracellular parts of gp130, the signal transducing chain of the interleukin-6 receptor complex. In COS-7 transfectants we observed a dose-dependent interleukin-5-inducible STAT1 activation for which the presence of both the alpha and the beta chain chimera was needed. No STAT activity was detected if one of the cytoplasmic tails of the receptor complex was deleted, indicating that STAT activity resulted from a receptor dimer rather than from higher receptor aggregates. We further investigated whether dimerization of STAT1 depends on the juxtaposition of two STAT recruitment modules in a receptor complex. We show that a receptor dimer with only a single STAT1 docking site was still able to lead to STAT1 activation. This indicates that the formation of a paired set of STAT binding sites in a receptor complex is not the prerequisite for STAT factor dimerization. Our findings are discussed in view of alternative STAT dimerization models.
