In Arabidopsis, CBL1 is activated by various abiotic stresses and functions as a positive regulator in salt or drought stress responses. It was also described as a negative regulator of cold response. By contrast, VDAC1 was stable under salt, cold or drought stresses in Arabidopsis during 24 h detected by semi-quantitative RT-PCR, whereas its expression was enhanced in mature plants after 48 h under cold stress examined by real-time PCR method (Figure 1b), indicating a possible role in cold stress response. Overexpression of VDAC1 reduced freezing tolerance, whereas vdac1 mutant plants showed superior performance to WT under freezing stress, suggesting that VDAC1 functions as a negative regulator in cold stress response. This is consistent with the role of CBL1 in cold stress response. CBL1 was shown to alter the expression of a series of cold-induced genes when subjected to cold stress. To test if VDAC1 and CBL1 could be involved in the regulation of a common set of genes, the expression of genes found to be altered by CBL1 under cold treatment were quantified in VDAC1 overexpressing and vdac1 mutant lines. Among these genes, the expression of DREB1A, a gene specifically responsive to cold, was inhibited in VDAC1-overexpressing plants, suggesting that VDAC1 overexpression exerted negative regulation on DREB1A. On the contrary, DREB1A was highly induced in vdac1 mutant plants (Figure 2f). These results indicate that VDAC1 and CBL1 have similar effects on the expression of DREB1A. The vdac1 mutant also showed superior performance during seed germination under low temperature, and the phenotypes observed for cbl1 resembled those of vdac1 (Figure 4c). To determine if the visual phenotypes of the mutants at 4 degreesC were due to quicker germination, but not faster growth, seeds were germinated at 22 degreesC for two days before being transferred to 4 degreesC. The mutants did not present any obvious morphological differences (data not shown). These results demonstrated that both VDAC1 and CBL1 function during seed germination at low temperature, suggesting a biological relevance of the two genes.
