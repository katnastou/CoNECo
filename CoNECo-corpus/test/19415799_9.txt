At low expression levels, GFP-MinCC/MinD localizes to the Z ring without disrupting it. This localization is dependent upon FtsZ but not other early division proteins such as FtsA, ZipA and ZapA, suggesting that MinCC/MinD interacts with FtsZ directly. An interaction between FtsZ and MinCC/MinD was observed in an in vitro assay, which strongly supports this idea. In this paper we further investigate the mechanism by which MinCC/MinD antagonizes Z ring formation. We isolated FtsZ mutants that are resistant to MinCC/MinD and then used these mutants to study the MinCC/MinD-FtsZ interaction and the basis of the toxicity associated with MinCC/MinD.
