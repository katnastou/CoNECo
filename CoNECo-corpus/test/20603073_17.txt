FAN1 is easily identifiable in Dictyostelium discoideum, which has orthologs of several Fanconi anemia proteins but no obvious orthologs are apparent in Drosophila or Xenopus. Interestingly, an S. pombe ortholog of FAN1 has a SAP domain, TRP domain and a nuclease domain, thus it is predicted to also function in DNA repair transactions. Fission yeast does not possess the classical FA proteins except for an ortholog of FANCM, Fml1, which promotes Rad51-dependent gene conversion at stalled replication forks and limits crossing over during mitotic double-strand break repair. It will be interesting to test if the S. pombe FAN1 mutant is sensitive to crosslinking agents and if so, how it functions without the other proteins present in human cells. This could shed light on alternative pathways for crosslink repair in human cells.
