We identified slam as an mRNA with noncoding information for localization and translational control in addition to its coding information. On the molecular level, slam is special in that mRNA and protein associate in a complex as demonstrated by co-immunoprecipitation. This unconventional relationship of slam RNA and protein may be important for the tightly restricted subcellular localization and strong increase in protein levels at the FC. The functional interaction of slam RNA and protein constitutes a positive feedback loop, which contributes to the fast increase in Slam protein levels at the FC.
