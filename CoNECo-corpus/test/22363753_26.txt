To compare our low resolution SAXS data with the crystal structure, we computed the theoretical SAXS curves and the pair-distance distribution function for the crystal structures of hPPARgamma DBD-LBD monomer and hPPARgamma/hRXRalpha DBD-LBD heterodimer (Figure 5). The crystallographic models do not fit well to the DAMs derived from our SAXS experiments. The profiles of the distance distribution functions p(r) corresponding to DAMs and generated for crystallography structures are typical for elongated particles. Nevertheless, the Dmax of the DAMs are larger than the crystallographic structure, which indicates that the protein in solution is more elongated than in the crystal.
