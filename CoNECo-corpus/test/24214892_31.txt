(A) AZI1-myc protein levels are reduced in mpk3 mutants. Proteins were extracted from seedlings of 35S::AZI1 and from 35S::AZI1/mpk3 (homozygous crossings of line 35S::AZI1_11.8 with mpk3). AZI1-myc expression was detected by immunoblotting with an antibody directed against the myc epitope tag. Protein loading was visualized by subsequent Coomassie Blue staining of the membrane (CBB). Homozygous 35S::AZI1/mpk3 lines (three are shown) have consistently less AZI1-myc protein. The experiment was repeated three times, with similar results.
