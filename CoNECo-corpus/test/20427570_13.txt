Deltamba1/Deltamdm38 mitochondria show severe defects in complexes III and IV of the respiratory chain. (A-C). Complex III, complex IV, and malate dehydrogenase activities were measured in isolated mitochondria from the strains indicated. SEs were calculated from three independent experiments. (D) Mitochondrial protein complexes were resolved by BN-PAGE, transferred to PVDF membranes, and probed with antibodies against Rip1 (complex III), Cox4 (complex IV), Tim54 (TIM22 complex), and Atp5 (FoF1-ATPase). Positions of molecular-weight markers in kDa are indicated. (E) Mitochondria (50 mug) of the indicated strains were analyzed by Western blotting with antibodies against the indicated proteins. Cyt b, cytochrome b; Cytc1, cytochrome c1; F1alpha, alpha subunit of the FoF1-ATPase. The arrows indicate proteins that show diminished levels in the double mutant.
