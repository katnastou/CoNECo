Emerging optical tools allow much finer control and observation of cellular processes using light, an actuator that can be delivered immediately and with subcellular spatial resolution. Optogenetic actuators allow light control of specific processes such as neuronal firing, but more general tools have also been developed to manipulate protein transcription, protein-protein interactions, and a variety of other cellular biochemical events. In previous work, we developed one such tool, a system using the Arabidopsis flavoprotein cryptochrome 2 (CRY2) and its interacting partner CIB1 to inducibly control protein interactions with light. While these proteins do not interact in the dark, blue light absorption triggers a conformational change in CRY2 allowing binding to CIB1 that is reversible after several minutes (t(1/2) ~5.5 min). When attached to diverse target proteins, the CRY2 and CIB1 modules allow tight light regulation of target protein activity.
