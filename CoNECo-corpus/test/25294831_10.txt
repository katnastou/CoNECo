A HYL1 promoter region (1240 bp upstream of the translation start site) and a full-length coding sequence (1257 bp) were amplified from Columbia seedlings. Then both sequences were cloned into pCAMBIA1301 binary vectors to obtain the pHYL1::HYL1 constructs. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed, and the primers used for polymerase chain reactions (PCRs) are listed in Supplementary Table S3.
