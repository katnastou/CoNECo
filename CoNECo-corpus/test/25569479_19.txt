elp1Delta yeast strains expressing myc-tagged ELP2 and either HA-tagged ELP3 (A) or ELP5 (B) were transformed with either empty vector or plasmids expressing the indicated ELP1 alleles (Table S2). Elp2-myc was immunoprecipitated from extracts and immunoprecipitates were examined by Western blotting with anti-myc and anti-HA antibodies to detect co-immunoprecipitated Elp1, Elp3 and Elp5 as indicated. Note that Elp1 runs as a doublet as observed previously.
