Cloning and characterization of cDNA encoding human A-type endothelin receptor.  
A cDNA coding for the human A-type endothelin receptor (ETA) was cloned from a human placenta cDNA library. The cDNA contained the entire coding sequence for the 427 amino acid protein with a relative Mr of 48,722. The deduced amino acid sequence of the human ETA was, respectively, 94% and 93% homologous with the sequence of bovine ETA and rat ETA, but was only 64% homologous with that of the human ETB receptor. Upon expression in COS-1 cells, the human ETA receptor showed binding activity to ETA, with the highest selectivity to ET-1. Northern blot analysis showed that the mRNA of human placenta ETA consists of one species 5 kilo-nucleotides in length, and the same analysis for the uterus, testis, heart and adrenal gland of Cynomolgus monkey showed that the cognate mRNAs are widely distributed.
