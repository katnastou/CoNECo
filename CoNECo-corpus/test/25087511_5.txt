Structural efforts have attempted to elucidate the mechanistic details of signal transduction spanning several domains from the periplasmic sensors to the cytoplasmic DHp domain, and numerous structures have been reported. Crystal structures are now available for multiple domains of two-component and chemotaxis systems, including a structure of the periplasmic sensor domain of PhoQ. NMR and X-ray structures have been solved for HAMP domains as well as TM regions. Many recent multi-domain crystal structures give us detailed view of the connections between cytoplasmic domains. A full length structure of an engineered, cytoplasmic two-component sensor (lacking a TM domain) was determined, as was the structure of the cytoplasmic region of VicK, from Streptococcus mutans. Despite these advances, several competing proposals still remain for a mechanism of transmembrane signaling.
