Pex30 has an N-terminal reticulon homology domain (RHD). Reticulons and reticulon-like proteins are abundant conserved ER-shaping membrane proteins that stabilize the highly curved portions of the ER, tubules, and the edges of ER sheets through the RHDs forming wedge-shaped hydrophobic hairpins. We found that overexpression of the RHD domain of Pex30 restores ER structure in S. cerevisiae cells lacking the reticulons. Endogenously expressed Pex30 is in ER subdomains in tubules and the edges of sheets, as are reticulons. The function of Pex30 is not known but it may play a role in peroxisome biogenesis since the size and number of peroxisomes is altered in cells lacking Pex30. Pex30 has also been suggested to reside at ER-peroxisome contacts.
