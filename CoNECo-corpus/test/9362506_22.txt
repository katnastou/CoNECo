It appears that the removal of alpha-SNAP stimulation of NSF ATPase activity results in a mutant unable to stimulate exocytosis in permeabilized chromaffin cells. It is probable that exogenously added alpha-SNAP must first interact with an endogenous factor, probably SNAREs, before the stimulation of NSF. Addition of an alpha-SNAP mutant that is able to bind but not stimulate NSF would be predicted to inhibit the action of exogenously added alpha-SNAP in chromaffin cells. To test this possibility, digitonin-permeabilized chromaffin cells were preincubated with either buffer, alpha-SNAP (1-160) (as a control), alpha-SNAP (1-285), or alpha-SNAP (L294A) for 25 min and stimulated with 10 muM Ca2+ for 30 min with or without 25 mug/ml alpha-SNAP. The results of four separate experiments were averaged, and the results were expressed as a percentage of the 10 muM Ca2+ stimulation. When preincubated with buffer alone, alpha-SNAP stimulated exocytosis above control levels (Fig. 5 B). Preincubation with alpha-SNAP (1-160) had no inhibitory effect on alpha-SNAP action (Fig. 5 B), which would be predicted because such a large truncation would abolish the ability to interact with SNAREs. However, addition of 25 mug/ml of either alpha-SNAP (1-285) or alpha-SNAP (L294A) resulted in the complete inhibition of the stimulatory activity of exogenous alpha-SNAP. The inhibitory effect of these mutants was still seen, even when an additional 10-min wash step was added between incubation of mutant proteins and the stimulation in the presence of alpha-SNAP (data not shown). It should be noted that the mutants alpha-SNAP (1-285) and alpha-SNAP (L294A) had little effect on endogenous exocytosis in the absence of added alpha-SNAP, nor did they do so even up to concentrations as high as 150 mug/ml (data not shown).
