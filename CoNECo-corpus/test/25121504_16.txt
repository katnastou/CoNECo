A hallmark property of circadian rhythms is that the period length is very constant over a wide range of physiologically relevant temperatures, termed temperature compensation. To investigate whether phosphorylation of dCLK might have a role in temperature compensation, we analyzed behavioral rhythms at three standard temperatures (i.e., 18degrees, 25degrees and 29degreesC). Although we noted a decrease in rhythmicity for dClk-15A;Clk out flies at 29degreesC, the periods were quite similar over the temperature range tested (Table 2), suggesting that global phosphorylation of dCLK does not play a major role in temperature compensation.
