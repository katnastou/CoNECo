The above experiments suggested, that the CTR plays a RENT complex-independent role supporting cellular growth, presumably by interacting with the 35S rDNA promoter. We therefore tested if the CTR harbors the Pol I transcription stimulating function of Net1. Haploid yeast strains carrying a NET1 or a net1Deltactr allele and co-expressing MNHA fusion proteins of the Pol I subunits Rpa43 or Rpa190 were subjected to ChEC and ChIP experiments. ChEC analyses revealed that Rpa43-MNHA and Rpa190-MNHA cleavage events at the 35S rDNA promoter region and at the 35S rDNA transcription termination site upstream of the RFB were reduced in net1Deltactr strains, when compared to cleavages in NET1 strains (Fig 5A compare lanes 1-4 with lanes 5-8, and lanes 17-20 with lanes 21-24). This pointed to a lower occupancy of Pol I molecules within the 35S rRNA gene region. ChIP experiments strongly supported this finding, since co-precipitation of 35S rDNA fragments with the tagged Pol I subunits was substantially impaired in net1Deltactr strains when compared with ChIP in NET1 strains (Fig 5B, ChIP of fragments 2-4). Importantly, ChEC and ChIP experiments indicated that expression of FLAGCTR in trans could fully restore Pol I association with the 35S rDNA in net1Deltactr cells to wild-type levels, in good correlation with the re-establishment of normal cell growth in these strains (Fig 5A, compare lanes 9-12, and 25-28 with lanes 13-16, and 29-32, respectively; Fig 5B, ChIP of fragments 2-4; S3 Table, doubling times).
