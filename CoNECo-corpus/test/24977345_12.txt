Interestingly, when we stimulated the nerve at a high frequency (10 Hz) for a prolonged period (10 min), mnb1 showed significantly faster rundown than controls (Fig. 3e-f). This result suggests that Mnb promotes efficient synaptic vesicle recycling during conditions of high activity. Presynaptic overexpression of mnb-F alone did not affect basal synaptic transmission and responses to high frequency stimulation as compared to the control, but restored maintenance of synaptic transmission when expressed in mnb1 mutant background (Fig. 3a-f). Together, these data indicate neuronal Mnb is required for rapid synaptic vesicle recycling.
