The first crystal structures of a complete ECF transporter revealed the subunits associated in a 1A':1A:1T:1S quaternary architecture as anticipated from solution studies on ECF transporters from L. lactis. The nucleotide-free EcfAA' ATPase subunits were observed in an open conformation. EcfT displayed a novel L-shaped fold in which a parallel bundle of five TM helices is roughly perpendicular to three cytoplasmic helices (CH1-3). The S subunit in each structure interacts exclusively with EcfT. Unexpectedly, the substrate-binding site is facing the cytoplasm, as if the entire EcfS subunit has been "toppled" from an extracellular-facing, substrate-capturing orientation. As a result, these crystal structures may have captured a post-translocation state in which nucleotides had dissociated and the transport substrate was released into the cytoplasm.
