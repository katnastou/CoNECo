Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase regulates glycosylphosphatidylinositol hydrolysis through PLC-gamma(2) activation in erythropoietin-stimulated cells.  
Erythropoietin (Epo)-induced glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) hydrolysis was previously described to be correlated with phospholipase C-gamma 2 (PLC-gamma2) activation. Here, we analyzed the involvement of phosphatidylinositol (PtdIns) 3-kinase in GPI hydrolysis through PLC-gamma2 tyrosine phosphorylation in response to Epo in FDC-P1 cells transfected with a wild type (WT) erythropoietin-receptor (Epo-R). We showed that phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PtdIns 3-kinase) inhibitor LY294002 inhibits Epo-induced hydrolysis of endogenous GPI and Epo-induced PLC-gamma2 tyrosine phosphorylation in a dose-dependent manner. Wortmannin, another PtdIns 3-kinase inhibitor, also suppressed Epo-induced PLC-gamma2 tyrosine phosphorylation. We also present evidence that PLC-gamma2 translocation to the membrane fraction on Epo stimulation is completely inhibited by LY294002. Upon Epo stimulation, the tyrosine-phosphorylated PLC-gamma2 was found to be associated with the tyrosine-phosphorylated Grb2-associated binder (GAB)2, SHC and SHP2 proteins. LY294002 cell preincubation did not affect GAB2, SHC and SHP2 tyrosine phosphorylation but inhibited the binding of PLC-gamma2 to GAB2 and SHP2. Taken together, these results show that PtdIns 3-kinase controls Epo-induced GPI hydrolysis through PLC-gamma2.
