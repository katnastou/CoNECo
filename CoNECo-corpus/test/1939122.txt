Initiation of protein synthesis in animal mitochondria. Purification and characterization of translational initiation factor 2.  
Bovine liver mitochondrial translational initiation factor 2 (IF-2mt) has been purified to near homogeneity. The scheme developed results in a 24,000-fold purification of the factor with about 26% recovery of activity. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis indicates that IF-2mt has a subunit molecular mass of 85 kDa. IF-2mt promotes the binding of formyl(f)Met-tRNA to mitochondrial ribosomes but is inactive with the nonformylated derivative. IF-2mt is active on chloroplast 30 S ribosomal subunits, but IF-2chl has no activity in promoting fMet-tRNA binding to animal mitochondrial ribosomes. IF-2mt is sensitive to elevated temperatures and is inactivated by treatment with N-ethylmaleimide. It is partially protected from heat and N-ethylmaleimide inactivation by the presence of either GTP or GDP suggesting that guanine nucleotides may bind to this factor directly. The binding of fMet-tRNA to mitochondrial ribosomes requires the presence of GTP and is inhibited by GDP. DeoxyGTP is very effective in replacing GTP in promoting fMet-tRNA binding to ribosomes and some activity is also observed with ITP. No activity is observed with ATP, CTP, or UTP. Nonhydrolyzable analogs of GTP can promote formation of both 28 S and 55 S initiation complexes indicating that GTP hydrolysis is not required for subunit joining in the animal mitochondrial system.
