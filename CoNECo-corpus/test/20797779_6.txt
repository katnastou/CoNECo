Protein tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs) remove phosphate groups from phosphorylated tyrosine residues, and play critical roles in cell communication, shape, motility, proliferation and differentiation. One well-known PTP, protein tyrosine phosphatase receptor type C (PTPRC, CD45), is important for thymocyte development and T cell activation, and is expressed on all nucleated cells of hemopoietic origin. The association between MBL and CD45 in immature T cells influences thymocyte development.
