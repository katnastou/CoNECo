In contrast to other cyclins involved in cell cycle progression, CycC does not oscillate. Instead, Cdk8/CycC activity appears to be regulated by other Mediator subunits. In line with a model previously suggested by others and us, we believe that Med12 and Med13 keep the Cdk8/CycC pair in a repressed state, which can be released when activators and/or signaling pathways induce structural changes in the Mediator complex. Loss of Med12 and/or Med13 may abolish this repressive effect, which explains the early entry into mitosis observed in med12Delta and med13Delta cells. In fact, loss of Med12 and Med13 leads to the release of CycC and Cdk8 from Mediator. We reasoned that a free pool of CycC and Cdk8 might affect cell cycle progression by interacting with alternative cyclins and Cdks. In support of this idea, a previous study of human CycC showed that the protein can interact with an alternative Cdk, namely CDK3. To address this possibility experimentally, here we fused CycC to Cdk8, thereby restricting interaction to the cognate partner and analyzed the effects of med12+ and med13+ deletion on cell cycle progression. As demonstrated here, the effects of med12Deltamed13Delta on mitotic progression are identical in the Cdk8-L-CycC strain to the effects observed in wt cells, strongly suggesting that Cdk8 and CycC act in concert to regulate timing of mitosis. Loss of Med12 and Med13 also causes early entry into S phase. Of interest, this effect is not observed in CycC-L-Cdk8 cells. The data suggest that eliminating the possibility for Cdk8 and CycC to interact with alternative cyclins and Cdks can restrict the effects of med12+ and med13+ deletions on cell cycle progression. Both overproduction of Cdk8 and mutations in CycC are observed in human tumors. It is tempting to speculate that these mutagenic changes may cause the formation of a free Cdk8 pool in mammalian cells, which could result in spontaneous interactions with alternative cyclins and promote S-phase progression. Limited information is available on the role of Cdk8 and CycC in M-phase progression in mammalian cells. We hope that our findings will stimulate others to elucidate whether the effects we observe in fission yeast are also conserved in higher organisms.
