This paper describes the discovery, through blind mutant screens, of yeast Ctf18-RFC mutants that destabilize triplet repeats. Genetic analysis indicates Ctf18-RFC likely acts through replication fork stabilization and/or post-replication repair (PRR), not SCC, to prevent triplet repeat instability, chromosome fragility and cell cycle delays in S and G2/M phases. Our data also support a general role for the Ctf18-RFC complex in preventing DNA damage, a role which becomes more crucial in the presence of an at-risk sequence such as an expanded trinucleotide repeat tract.
