Breast cancer tissue microarray (TMA) of 334 cases of invasive ductal carcinomas is obtained from the tissue bank at the Markey Cancer Center's tissue repository at our institute. Tissue samples were stained with anti-Dub3 (Abcam, ab12991, 1:100 dilution) and anti-Snail1 (Abcam, ab53519, 1:250 dilution) antibodies, and each sample was scored by an H-score method that combines the values of immunoreaction intensity and the percentage of tumour cell staining as described previously. Chi-square analysis was used to analyse the relationship between Dub3 and Snail1 expression; statistical significance was defined as P<0.05.
