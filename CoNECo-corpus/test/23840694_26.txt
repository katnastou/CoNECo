The Vps33 family of SM proteins, unlike the Sec1/Munc18, Sly1, and Vps45 families, does not appear to interact with the N-peptides of Qa-SNAREs. The structural basis for this key distinction among SM protein families can be understood by superimposing domain 1 of Vps33 upon that of other, N-peptide-binding SM proteins. This analysis reveals that the binding site normally occupied by the N-peptide's conserved Arg side chain (Fig. 5A) is, uniquely in the case of Vps33, filled by Arg-115 of the SM protein itself (Fig. 5B). The positioning of the Arg-115 side chain is reinforced by a salt-bridge formed with Asp-120. Also blocked - and only in Vps33- is the pocket that normally accommodates a conserved hydrophobic residue located four residues C-terminal to the N-peptide Arg residue (Fig. 5C,D). In this case a displacement of the Vps33 backbone, relative to other SM proteins, causes the side chain of Leu-129 to occupy the binding pocket. Thus, both of the pockets that in other SM proteins accommodate conserved Qa-SNARE N-peptide residues are missing in Vps33. Likewise, the N-terminal region of the relevant Qa-SNARE Vam3 lacks the sequence determinants - including the conserved Arg - found in the N-peptides of the Qa-SNAREs that bind SM proteins.
