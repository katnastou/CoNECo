2 ODs of cells grown in SD media to exponential phase (OD600=0.5-1) were spheroplasted by treatment with 2.5 U per OD of Zymolyase (Zymo Research; Orange, CA). The total RNA was extracted using the NucleoSpin RNA extraction kit (Macherey Nagel). 1 mug of resulting RNAs were then treated with DNase I (NEB) and subjected to reverse transcriptionusing Maxima First Strand cDNA synthesis Kit for quantitative PCR with reverse transcription (Thermo Scientific). Quantitative real time PCR was performed with Maxima SYBR Green qPCR Master Mix (Thermo Scientific) in a Bio-Rad CFX96 Real-Time PCR system using OLE1 and ACT1 specific primers. The OLE1 mRNA abundance in mutants was normalized to ACT1 mRNA levels and expressed relative to OLE1 expression in WT using the Livak method. Six experiments were performed and the relative mRNA levels were averaged.
