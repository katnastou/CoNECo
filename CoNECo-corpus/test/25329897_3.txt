Rap1GAP is a member of a family of GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs) that specifically stimulate the GTP hydrolysis of Rap1 GTPases. Rap1 is one of the Ras-like small GTPases that are critical players in signaling pathways that control cell growth, migration, and differentiation. Rap1 shuttles between an inactive GDP- and active GTP-bound form. Activation of Rap1 (Rap1-GTP) is mediated by guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs), including C3G, PDZ-GEF, Epac, and CalDAG. Inactivation of Rap1 is mediated by GTPase activating proteins (GAPs), including Rap1GAP and Rap1GAP2, SPA-1/SIPA1 and SIPA1L1/SPAR.
