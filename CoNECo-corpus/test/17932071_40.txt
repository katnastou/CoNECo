Although the above-mentioned simulation must be regarded as very preliminary and will have to be validated by more advanced computational methods and perhaps also by biophysical measurements, it generally agrees with our experimental finding that mutations of residues at the Trm6p/Trm61p interface do not disrupt oligomerization, but interfere with tRNA binding. Thus, we propose that the presence of salt bridges in the yeast m1A58 Mtase (Trm61p-E255 and Trm6p-R420, and between Trm6p-E416 and Trm61p-R259), and most likely also in bacterial TrmI Mtases (e.g. E299-R233 in Rv2118c), serves to establish the structure of the tRNA-binding region rather than to promote binding of subunits to each other. We hypothesize that the mutations reported in this work could have long-range structural effects on the conformation of the positively charged loop (residues 265-345) in the Trm61p subunit, which may be involved in tRNA binding. By identifying amino acids involved in tRNA binding, this study has provided a foundation on which further studies can be built, such as experiments to address our hypothesis regarding tRNA binding and to determine how the yeast m1A58 Mtase is able to recognize substrate tRNAs amongst the cellular tRNA pool.
