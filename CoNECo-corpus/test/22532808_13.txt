All dysc alleles were recessive; trans-heterozygotic combinations of the three alleles were largely arrhythmic; and heterozygosity for both dysc s168 and dysc c03838 in combination with a deficiency removing the dysc locus also resulted in arrhythmia (Table 1). In addition, precise excision of the dysc s168 P-element restored wild-type patterns of locomotion (Table 1), indicating that the P-element insertion is responsible for arrhythmicity. Finally, to test whether transgenic expression of dysc could restore rhythmic behavior, we generated flies carrying a UAS-dysc transgene encoding a long isoform of DYSC. Pan-neuronal expression of the UAS-dysc transgene in dysc mutants was sufficient to rescue rhythmic behavior (Figure 2E and Table 2). Consistent with the fact that dysc s168 homozygotes, which express normal levels of the short isoform, are arrhythmic, transgenic expression of a short DYSC isoform did not restore rhythmicity in dysc c03838 mutants (Table 2; see Figure S3 for expression levels of long and short dysc transgenes). Over-expression of either the long or short isoforms of DYSC in a wild-type background did not affect circadian rhythmicity (Table 2). These results comprehensively demonstrate that DYSC is required for circadian alterations in locomotor activity, and furthermore indicate that correct circadian output requires DYSC expression in the nervous system.
