Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 gp120 envelope glycoprotein regions important for association with the gp41 transmembrane glycoprotein.  
Insertion of four amino acids into various locations within the amino-terminal halves of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 gp120 or gp41 envelope glycoprotein disrupts the noncovalent association of these two envelope subunits (M. Kowalski, J. Potz, L. Basiripour, T. Dorfman, W. C. Goh, E. Terwilliger, A. Dayton, C. Rosen, W. A. Haseltine, and J. Sodroski, Science 237:1351-1355, 1987). To localize the determinants on the gp120 envelope glycoprotein important for subunit association, amino acids conserved among primate immunodeficiency viruses were changed. Substitution mutations affecting either of two highly conserved regions located at the amino (residues 36 to 45) and carboxyl (residues 491 to 501) ends of the mature gp120 molecule resulted in nearly complete dissociation of the envelope glycoprotein subunits. Partial dissociation phenotypes were observed for some changes affecting residues in the third and fourth conserved gp120 regions. These results suggest that hydrophobic regions at both ends of the gp120 glycoprotein contribute to noncovalent association with the gp41 transmembrane glycoprotein.
