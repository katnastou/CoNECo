We also wanted to determine if the interaction with ABI-1 is isoform specific with respect to MIG-10. As described previously, the three predicted splice variants of mig-10 encode isoforms that differ only in their N-termini (Fig. 1). In particular, the N-terminus of MIG-10A contains a proline-rich region with a putative SH3 binding site that is missing in MIG-10B, the smallest isoform. MIG-10B:V5 also co-immunoprecipitated with wild type ABI-1:GFP (Fig. 2E), demonstrating that both isoforms are capable of interaction with ABI-1, and suggesting that the N-termini of the MIG-10 isoforms are not essential to the interaction.
