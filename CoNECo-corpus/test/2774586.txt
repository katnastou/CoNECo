Role of variant prealbumin in the pathogenesis of familial amyloidotic polyneuropathy: fate of normal and variant prealbumin in the circulation. 
According to recent studies on protein chemistry and genetic engineering, replacement of the Val30 residue of prealbumin by methionine is believed to play a critical role in the formation of amyloid deposit and the pathogenesis of familial amyloidotic polyneuropathy (FAP). However, only limited information is available concerning the behavior of prealbumin in the circulation. To obtain the molecular insight into the mechanism of amyloid deposition, it is indispensable to know the fates of normal and variant prealbumin in vivo. Thus, the fates of prealbumin samples from normal and FAP patients were studied in normal rats as well as in animals that were challenged with acute inflammation induced by turpentine. The effect of in vitro photooxidation of prealbumin samples on their behavior was also examined in vivo. Kinetic analysis revealed no appreciable difference between prealbumin samples from normal and FAP patients. These results suggest that factors other than the rate of transfer of the variant form prealbumin from plasma to an extravascular compartment may play a critical role in the pathogenesis of amyloid deposition in FAP patients.
