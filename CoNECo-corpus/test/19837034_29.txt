Although we do not have sufficient data to model the replisome, the electrostatic surface potential of Pol gammaA is informative. As expected, the putative DNA-binding channel is lined with positively charged residues but the opposite surface of the protein presents a large negatively charged region near the exo domain and the tip of the AID subdomain also contains four sequential glutamates (535EEEE538, E-tract; Fig. 5A). The human mitochondrial helicase, Twinkle, has a highly positively charged C-terminal region that could contact one of these regions. If the interaction is through the negatively charged E-tract in the replisome, Twinkle would be positioned in a location close to that of the 363RKK365 and 328RK329, residues important in Twinkle-dependent replication of duplex DNA.
