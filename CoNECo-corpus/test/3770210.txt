cDNA sequence of human beta-preprotachykinin, the common precursor to substance P and neurokinin A.  
The nucleotide sequence of cDNA encoding the human substance P precursor, beta-preprotachykinin (beta-PPT), has been determined. The source of mRNA was a human laryngeal carcinoid tumour that contained a high concentration of immunoreactive substance P. The human beta-PPT polypeptide is 129 amino acids long and contains regions encoding substance P and neurokinin A, each flanked by basic amino acid residues. Residues 72-107 of the human beta-PPT polypeptide encode the sequence of neuropeptide K, an N-terminally extended form of neurokinin A recently isolated from porcine brain.
