Although Sp3 is the only protein in the Sp subfamily that can either positively or negatively modulate the Sp1-dependent gene expression, our experiments demonstrated that Sp3 positively regulates the exon 1b promoter activity in SL2 cells. Taken together, these results establish that Sp1 and Sp3 are biologically essential regulators of the SVCT2 exon 1b gene expression along with YY1.
