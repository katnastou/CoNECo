To confirm that plasma cBIN1-MPs are of cardiomyocyte origin, we took advantage of mice with cardiac-specific heterozygous deletion of the Bin1 gene (Bin1 HT). Bin1 HT mice are grossly phenotypically normal with normal cardiac contractile function at young adulthood (2-4 months). Yet, their cardiomyocytes lose cBIN1-microfolds at t-tubules, and t-tubule remodeling occurs with this loss of microfolds within the t-tubule membrane. Plasma for MP acquisition was obtained from Bin1 HT mice and their wild-type (WT) littermate controls. Purified MPs were fixed and colabeled with anti-cBIN1-Alexa 647 and annexin V-Alexa 488. Plasma MPs were loaded in TruCount tubes, and a total of 20,000 events were counted. Based on the known concentration of TruCount reference beads, the plasma concentration of MPs could be determined. Both the total MP population and the subpopulation of double positive in cBIN1 and annexin V (cBIN1-MPs) were quantified and compared between WT and Bin1 HT mice. As indicated in Fig 1D, although total plasma MP concentration is not significantly altered in Bin1 HT mice (Fig 1D, left panel), the plasma concentration of cBIN1-MPs (Fig 1D, right panel; representative flow scatter plots against IgG isotype control are in S1C Fig) in Bin1 HT mice (251.8 +/- 48.3 MPs/ml) is significantly decreased by 47% from WT mice (470.4 +/- 67.8 MPs/ml) (p < 0.05) (Fig 1D). Consistent with less cBIN1-MPs, biochemical immunoprecipitation followed by western blot detection further confirmed that the cBIN1 protein level is reduced in plasma from Bin1 HT mice, corresponding to a similar reduction of cBIN1 protein in heart lysates from the same mice (Fig 1E). Taken together, these data support that cBIN1 in plasma is present in MPs of cardiomyocyte origin.
