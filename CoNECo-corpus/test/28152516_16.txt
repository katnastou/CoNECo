Nuclear/cytoplasmic distribution and phosphorylation of YAP significantly influence its stabilization. To find out if TNFAIP8 could stabilize YAP protein, we treated HCC cells with protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide (CHX) after 40 hours of transfection. Relative protein intensity was shown in Supplementary Figure S4A. We observed that, after 6 hours of CHX treatment, TNFAIP8 overexpression significantly upregulated total YAP protein. TNFAIP8 siRNA showed the opposite effects (Figure 4C & Supplementary Figure S4A). These results indicate that the half-life of endogenous YAP increased with TNFAIP8 transfection and decreased after siRNA treatment. Then we performed luciferase reporter assay using reporter plasmid with 8xGTIIC-luciferase. The activity of TEAD luciferase reporter indicates transcriptional activity of YAP. Upregulation of TEAD luciferase activity correlates with inhibition of Hippo signaling pathway. As shown in Figure 4D, TNFAIP8 positively regulated transcription of YAP/TEAD. Based on the above results, we assumed that TNFAIP8 could stabilize the YAP protein and thus increase its steady-state protein level and nuclear localization, leading to inhibition of Hippo signaling.
