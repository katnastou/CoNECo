As deleting its initiation motif abolished geminin degradation, we used this substrate to identify key residues required for promoting initiation. We found that mutation of charged residues (RE40; KRK50-52; HR53/54) to alanine interfered with the APC/C-dependent ubiquitination and degradation of geminin (Figure 2A; Figure S2A). Assays with methylubiquitin revealed that RE40/41, KRK50-52, and HR53/54 were required for efficient chain initiation (Figure 2B). Interestingly, changing all Lys residues to arginine did not strongly affect geminin degradation or chain initiation, showing that the initiation motif has functions in addition to providing ubiquitin acceptor sites. As expected for a motif controlling the degradation of a key cell cycle regulator, functionally important, but not irrelevant, residues are highly conserved among geminin homologs from different organisms (Figure S2B).
