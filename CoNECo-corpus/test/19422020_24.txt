We have previously shown that forced expression of Optix in the developing eye leads to severe alterations in eye structure. This activity was mapped to the nonconserved C-terminal tail as the replacement of the So CT with that of Optix leads to the same degree of roughening as full-length Optix. In this report, we have extended this early observation by functionally dissecting the C-terminal segment of the Optix protein and (1) demonstrated that while the CT is necessary for inhibiting eye development, it also requires the activity of the protein-protein interaction and DNA binding regions; (2) identified that regions A, C, and D of the CT are required for blocking retinal formation; (3) shown that region D is specifically conserved just within the Drosophilids; (4) demonstrated that the CT is required for the ability of Optix to induce ectopic eyes; (5) shown that none of the vertebrate SIX proteins are capable of inducing ectopic eyes in flies; and (6) demonstrated that in addition to so homologs, expression of DSix4 and Six4 can also rescue so1 loss-of-function mutants.
