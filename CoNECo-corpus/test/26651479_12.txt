If TMEM106B associates with CHMP2B, what is its role in the ESCRT-involved endolysosomal pathway? Because TMEM106B associates with CHMP2B in endosomal pathways and functions in lysosomes, TMEM106B might be involved in autophagy with reference to its association with CHMP2B. In order to investigate this question, we examined whether the expression of the TMEM106B variants affected autophagic flux. In order to measure autophagic flux, the levels of microtubule-associated protein 1A/1B-light chain 3 (LC3)-II in cells expressing T185 or S185 in the presence or absence of the lysosomotrophic reagent ammonium chloride (NH4Cl) were quantified in a western blot analysis. As shown in Fig. 2e-f, cells expressing T185 showed a slight reduction in autophagic flux compared to cells expressing S185. These results suggested that the enhanced sequestration of CHMP2B might reduce autophagic flux.
