To identify the putative interacting protein, we used an unbiased forward genetic strategy and discovered SOL-2, a CUB-domain transmembrane protein that is the homologue of the vertebrate Neto proteins, with 2 CUB-domains and a LDLa-domain. As predicted, we found that s-SOL-1 function was dependent on SOL-2 and that SOL-2 associates with the GLR-1 signaling complex. We show that surface delivery of GLR-1 and SOL-1 occurs in the absence of SOL-2; however, the stability or function of the complex appears compromised in sol-2 mutants. In sol-1 mutants, the remaining components of the GLR-1 complex are also delivered to the postsynaptic membrane, indicating that SOL-1 does not have an essential role in assembly or trafficking of the signaling complex. We demonstrate that GLR-1-mediated currents depend on both SOL-1 and SOL-2, and that currents in sol-1 and sol-2 mutants can be rescued in adults, thus demonstrating an ongoing role for these CUB-domain proteins in synaptic transmission.
