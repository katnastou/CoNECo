In order to successfully infect human cells, HIV-1 has to neutralize cellular restriction factors that impede its replication at multiple steps. HIV-1 Vpu serves this goal by counteracting a blockade imposed by the newly identified protein tetherin. Under basal conditions, tetherin is expressed in B and T cells, plasmacytoid dendritic cells and myeloid cells. In addition, tetherin expression is strongly upregulated in many cell types by type-I interferon (IFN), a situation typically encountered in viral infections. Tetherin is a heavily glycosylated type-II transmembrane protein with an unusual topology, which is otherwise only found in mammals in a minor but pathologically important topological variant of the prion protein. Tetherin is indeed linked to membranes both by its one-pass transmembrane domain and by a C-ter GPI anchor. This anti-viral factor is mostly intracellular, but it is also localized at the cell surface in lipid rafts, from where it is continually recycled to the trans-Golgi network. In cells expressing tetherin, HIV-1 viruses deleted for the Vpu gene can bud normally but remain tethered to the cell surface through a protein bond. The mechanistic details of this phenomenon remain to be clarified. A hypothesis, that still awaits confirmation, is that tetherin itself forms the protein tether between the cell surface and the virion owing to its ability to form stable dimers. The affected virions are then endocytosed and probably degraded in lysosomes. In addition to inhibiting HIV-1, tetherin also blocks the replication of numerous retroviruses, as well as other non-related enveloped viruses. The importance of this restriction in the cellular antiviral arsenal is underscored by the apparent positive selection that tetherin undergoes, which is the hallmark of an ongoing molecular fight with pathogens.
