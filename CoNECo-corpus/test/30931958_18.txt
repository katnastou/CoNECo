To verify that Abf2 and Mhr1 are required for mtDNA maintenance, we analyzed mtDNA levels relative to nuclear DNA using quantitative PCR. We observed that the mtDNA level in incrementabf2 cells was less than half (46.3 +/- 8.6%) that of WT cells grown in YPGly medium (Fig. 6a). Consistent with our previous results, a large proportion (83.9 +/- 15.3%) of mtDNA content was retained in mhr1-1 cells grown in glycerol medium, while we observed no additive effect on the depletion of mtDNA in incrementabf2 mhr1-1 double-mutant cells (51.4 +/- 8.8%), suggesting Abf2 is dispensable for Mhr1-driven mtDNA replication (Fig. 6a).
