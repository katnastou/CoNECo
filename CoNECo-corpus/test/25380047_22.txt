Our previous proteomic screens identified a number of proteins associated with AP-3 that could coordinate both the interaction of SEPT6 or SEPT7 with F-actin and that of AP-3 with membranes or could regulate a switch from F-actin to microtubules during MVB biogenesis. Their function can now be tested in the light of our current findings.
