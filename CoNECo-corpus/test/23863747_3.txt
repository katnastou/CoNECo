Chondrosarcoma (CS) is the second most common primary malignant bone tumour. When such tumours arise as solitary lesions in the medullary cavity (central CS) or more rarely in the periosteum, ~50% harbour either a somatic IDH1 (isocitrate dehydrogenase 1) or IDH2 heterozygous mutation. In a minority of individuals, these tumours are multiple, and affected individuals are at risk of developing other neoplasms, including spindle cell haemangiomas, and high-grade gliomas/secondary glioblastomas, among others. In this setting, the mosaic distribution of tumours is caused by somatic early post-zygotic mutations of IDH1 and IDH2 (ref.). The same mutations have been previously identified in ~70% of sporadic high-grade gliomas and secondary glioblastomas, ~10% of acute myeloid leukemias (AMLs) and cholangiocarcinomas (CCs), and much less commonly in other neoplasms. The mutant (mt) IDH enzyme catalyses the reduction of alpha-ketoglutarate (alpha-KG) to D-2-hydroxyglutarate (2-HG), an oncometabolite affecting the activity of alpha-KG-dependent dioxygenases: these events affect a number of cellular responses, and have been shown to induce CpG island DNA hypermethylation in low-grade gliomas (LGGs), CCs and AMLs harbouring IDH1 and IDH2 mutations. The TET dioxygenases are responsible for the conversion of 5-methylcytosine to 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC), an intermediate metabolite in the recently discovered active demethylation pathway, and it is possible that mt IDH1 enzyme mediates the observed hypermethylation phenotype through inhibition of TET by 2-HG.
