The miRNA pathway involves the loading of a miRNA into RISC (miRISC), and the active association of miRISC with target mRNAs. We visualized the distribution of all miRISC complexes (active, loaded, and inactive) in Drosophila cells using an antibody recognizing the Ago1 protein, a key subunit of miRISC. Ago1 was detected in the cytoplasm of cells, and was enriched in the perinuclear region (Fig. 3f), where lysosomes tend to localize. In dHPS4 mutant cells, Ago1 was not enriched in the perinuclear region but was more dispersed throughout the cytoplasm (Fig. 3g). This result suggests that Ago1 localization correlates with trafficking endosomes. As further evidence, cells mutant for vps25 and the ESCRT regulator myopic showed Ago1 concentrated around large cytoplasmic vesicles (Fig. 3h-i). These mutations generate cells with enlarged early endosomes because they block sorting of early endosomes into MVBs. Hence, the distribution of miRISC appears to correlate with the status of MVBs; blocking MVB formation concentrates miRISC in early endosomes while blocking MVB turnover disperses miRISC from lysosomes. Even though Ago1 is dispersed in dHPS4 cells, it is still associated with membranes in the cytoplasm (SFig. 3a). We separated cytoplasmic membrane from cytosol by OptiPrep density gradient centrifugation, and found a substantial fraction of Ago1 protein associated with membrane. There was little change in its association with membrane in dHPS4 mutant preparations. A similar result was observed with Ago2 protein (SFig. 3a).
