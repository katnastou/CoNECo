Cited1 is a bifunctional transcriptional cofactor that regulates early nephronic patterning. 
In a screen to identify factors that regulate the conversion of mesenchyme to epithelium during the early stages of nephrogenesis, it was found that the Smad4-interacting transcriptional cofactor, Cited1, is expressed in the condensed cap mesenchyme surrounding the tip of the ureteric bud (UB), is downregulated after differentiation into epithelia, and has the capacity to block UB branching and epithelial morphogenesis in cultured metanephroi. Cited1 represses Wnt/beta-catenin but activates Smad4-dependent transcription involved in TGF-beta and Bmp signaling. By modifying these pathways, Cited1 may coordinate cellular differentiation and survival signals that regulate nephronic patterning in the metanephros.
