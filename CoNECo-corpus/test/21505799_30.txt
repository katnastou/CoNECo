We next measured the impact of malin pathogenic mutations on the glycogenic capacity of R5/PTG protein. The cotransfection of laforin with wild-type malin led to a marked decrease of glycogen levels in HEK293 cells expressing R5/PTG compared to cells overexpressing only R5/PTG (Fig. 8). This result is consistent with the fact that the laforin-malin complex downregulates R5/PTG via a proteasomal degradation pathway. In contrast, malinC46Y, malinP69A, malinD146N, and malinL261P mutants all failed to reduce glycogen levels. As illustrated in Fig. 8, accumulation of glycogen levels was detected in cells expressing malin mutants but not in cells expressing wild-type malin (p < 0.01).
