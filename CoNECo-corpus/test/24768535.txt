Modification of PCNA by ISG15 plays a crucial role in termination of error-prone translesion DNA synthesis.  In response to DNA damage, PCNA is mono-ubiquitinated and triggers translesion DNA synthesis (TLS) by recruiting polymerase-eta. However, it remained unknown how error-prone TLS is turned off after DNA lesion bypass to prevent mutagenesis. Here we showed that ISG15 modification (ISGylation) of PCNA plays a key role in TLS termination. Upon UV irradiation, EFP, an ISG15 E3 ligase, bound to mono-ubiquitinated PCNA and promoted its ISGylation. ISGylated PCNA then tethered USP10 for deubiquitination and in turn the release of polymerase-eta from PCNA. Eventually, PCNA was deISGylated by UBP43 for reloading of replicative DNA polymerases and resuming normal DNA replication. However, ISGylation-defective Lys-to-Arg mutations in PCNA or knockdown of any of ISG15, EFP, or USP10 led to persistent recruitment of mono-ubiquitinated PCNA and polymerase-eta to nuclear foci, causing an increase in mutation frequency. These findings establish a crucial role of PCNA ISGylation in termination of error-prone TLS for preventing excessive mutagenesis.
