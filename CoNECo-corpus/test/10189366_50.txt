NuMA is well known for its role in the formation and stabilization of the mitotic spindle. Accumulation of NuMA has been shown at the mitotic spindle poles and at or near the minus ends of microtubules. Sequestration of endogenous NuMA by microinjection of anti-NuMA antibodies into mitotic cultured cells was shown to disrupt the bipolar mitotic spindles. The spindle association activity of NuMA was mapped to its COOH-terminal part (residues 1538-2115). A recent study showed that the critical sequences for spindle pole localization are contained within the amino acid residues 1750-1800 of NuMA. However, the mechanism by which NuMA binds to microtubules is not clear. NuMA does not contain a microtubule-binding region of kinesin, Map2, or tau, but has been shown to directly bind to tubulin and organize microtubule formation through the distal portion of its COOH-terminal domain.
