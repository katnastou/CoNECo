RR is regulated by an intricate allosteric mechanism. The two allosteric sites of RR are the specificity site (S-site), which determines substrate preference, and the activity site (A-site), which stimulates or inhibits RR activity depending on whether ATP or dATP is bound. While it is known that dATP, which is less abundant in the cell than ATP, has a 100-fold higher affinity for RR, the mechanism for this is unknown. Most of our knowledge on RR has been derived from studies on the E. coli and other prokaryotic enzymes, which exist as alpha2beta2 hetero-tetramers. This organization failed, however, to mechanistically explain how dATP inactivates and ATP activates the enzyme. Recent biochemical studies suggest that both dATP and ATP regulate mouse RR (mRR) by altering its oligomeric state in an ATP/dATP concentration-dependent manner. The Cooperman group proposed that dATP induces an inactive mRR1 tetramer, while ATP induces active mRR1 dimers and hexamers. Interestingly, in a previous study Thelander and co-workers observed dATP and ATP induced tetramers for calf thymus RR1. In contrast, the Hofer group proposed that both dATP and ATP induce mRR1 hexamers. In fact, the cancer drug gemcitabine has been shown to inactivate a higher order oligomer of human RR. Additionally, recent reports suggest that the E. coli RR1 instead of forming hexamers forms tetramers. However, the structural basis for dNTP regulation by RR oligomerization is not known.
