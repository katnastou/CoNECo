Using antibodies specific for Ftz or Eve, we performed chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) and mapped genome-wide transcription factor binding in cellular blastoderm embryos 2 hours AEL on custom designed high density DNA microarrays. We found 1286 Ftz and 1499 Eve bound probes (intensity P < 0.0001 and Z score > 1.96, see supplemental method; 21 probes on both lists map within 500bp). We analyzed several methods for probe to target gene mapping to maximize the overlap between the differentially expressed and ChIP target gene sets (see supplemental methods; fig. S1). The greatest such enrichment was obtained by designating genes within 1kb of a binding site as targets. At this threshold, we identified 969 Ftz ChIP-chip target genes and 932 Eve ChIP-chip target genes (overlap 175 genes; table S3, S4).
