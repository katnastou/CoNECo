Chemical characterization of the parasitophorous vacuole membrane antigen QF 116 from Plasmodium falciparum. 
On the basis of amino acid sequencing and immunological cross-reactivity, the Plasmodium falciparum parasitophorous vacuole antigens QF116 and exp-1/CRA are apparently identical. The epitope recognized by an inhibitory monoclonal antibody directed against QF116 is located proximal to the C-terminus of the protein. The QF116 protein is processed during maturation by the cleavage of a 22-amino-acid signal peptide and acylated as measured by labeling with myristic acid.
