In Western blot analysis we showed that 14.7K, TNFR1 and RIP1 coimmunoprecipitated with HA-tagged optineurin, indicating formation of a protein complex (Figure 1A). This result was in good accordance with previous studies, describing optineurin as a 14.7K and RIP1 interacting protein. Of note, formation of the 14.7K-optineurin complex was also detectable without stimulation while recruitment to the TNFR1 complex and ubiquitination of TNFR1-associated RIP1 were dependent on TNF treatment. Interestingly, even though the predicted binding sites of 14.7K and RIP1 were both located in the C-terminus of optineurin, 14.7K obviously did not disturb interaction of optineurin and RIP1.
