(D-I) Localization of YcgR-GFP in various Salmonella strains. Strains expressing either GFP or YcgR-GFP were grown in the presence of arabinose and analyzed by fluorescence microscopy as described in the Experimental Procedures. (D) Wild-type (pgfpOE). (E) Wild-type (pycgROE). (F) DeltayhjH (pycgROE). (G) DeltayhjH DeltafliM (pycgROE). (H) DeltayhjH DeltafliG (pycgROE). (I) DeltayhjH DeltamotA (pycgROE).
