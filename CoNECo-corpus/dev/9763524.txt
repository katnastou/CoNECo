Ligand specificity of LOX-1, a novel endothelial receptor for oxidized low density lipoprotein.  
Endothelial dysfunction, or activation, elicited by oxidized low density lipoprotein (Ox-LDL) and its lipid constituents has been shown to play a key role in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis. We recently have identified a novel receptor for Ox-LDL-designated lectin-like Ox-LDL receptor (LOX-1) in vascular endothelial cells. To examine ligand specificity of LOX-1, we established CHO cell lines stably expressing both human and bovine LOX-1 (LOX-1-CHO). LOX-1-CHO bound and degraded 125I-labeled Ox-LDL but did not significantly degrade 125I-labeled acetylated LDL (Ac-LDL). Fucoidin and maleylated BSA (M-BSA), which inhibit 125I-Ox-LDL binding to class A scavenger receptors, did not inhibit 125I-Ox-LDL binding or degradation in LOX-1-CHO. Polyinosinic acid and carrageenan, in contrast, significantly reduced 125I-Ox-LDL binding to LOX-1-CHO by 62% and 60%, respectively. Delipidated and untreated 125I-Ox-LDL were bound and degraded equally in LOX-1-CHO; furthermore, excess amounts of unlabeled, delipidated Ox-LDL inhibited binding and degradation of untreated 125I-Ox-LDL. Taken together, LOX-1 is a receptor for Ox-LDL but not for Ac-LDL. LOX-1 recognizes protein moiety of Ox-LDL, and its ligand specificity is distinct from other receptors for Ox-LDL, including class A and B scavenger receptors.
