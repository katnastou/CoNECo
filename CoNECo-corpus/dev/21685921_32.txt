The atomic models of the RGS-domains-Galpha complexes used in the calculations were taken from the following PDB entries: 1AGR (Galphai1-RGS4); 2IK8 (Galphai1-RGS16); 3C7K (Galphao-RGS16); 2IHB (Galphai3-RGS10); 2GTP (Galphai1-RGS1); 2ODE (Galphai3-RGS8); 1FQJ (Galphai1/t-RGS9); 2V4Z (Galphai3-RGS2-C106S/N184D/E191K triple mutant) . Colicin-immunity-protein atomic models were taken from the following PDB entries: 7CEI, 2JAZ, 2JB0, 2JBG, 1ZNV (wild-type E7-Im7) . Although some of these E7 proteins contain point mutations, these mutations are far from the Im7 binding site and therefore these chains were considered wild type); 1UJZ, 2ERH (Computationally-redesigned E7-Im7) ; 3GJN, 3GKL (E7 bound to in vitro evolved Im9) . Missing short segments in 2IK8 (Galphai1 residues 112-118), 2IHB (RGS10 residues 103-113), and 2GTP (Galphai1 residues 112-118) were modeled based on the structure of Galphai1-RGS4 (PDB id 1AGR) using the program Nest and partial or missing side chains were modeled using Scap . Similarly, a short missing E7 segment in the following structures was modeled based on PDB id 7CEI: 2JBG (residues 547-554), 2JAZ (residues 548-554), 2JB0 (residues 551-552), 1ZNV (residues 547-554), 3GJN (residues 549-554), 3GKL (residues 548-554). Hydrogen atoms were added using CHARMM, and the structures were subjected to conjugate gradient minimization with a harmonic restraint force of 50 kcal mol-1 Aa-2 applied to the heavy atoms.
