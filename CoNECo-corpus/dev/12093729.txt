Involvement of Fes/Fps tyrosine kinase in semaphorin3A signaling.  
Collapsin response mediator proteins (CRMPs)/TOAD64/Ulips/DRPs and CRAM have emerged as strong candidates for a role in semaphorin signaling. In this study we identified Fes/Fps (Fes) tyrosine kinase in the CRMP-CRAM complex and investigated whether Fes was involved in semaphorin3A (Sema3A) signaling. In COS-7 cells, the interaction between Fes and plexinA1 (PlexA1) and the tyrosine phosphorylation of PlexA1 by Fes were observed; however, these events were significantly attenuated by co-expression of neuropilin-1 (NP-1). Even with NP-1 co-expression, Sema3A was able to enhance the association of Fes with PlexA1 and Fes-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation of PlexA1, CRAM and CRMP2. Co-expression of Fes with PlexA1 exhibited COS-7 cell contraction activity, indicating that Fes can convert inactive PlexA1 to its active form, whereas combination of Fes/NP-1/PlexA1 or Fes kinase-negative mutants/PlexA1 did not alter cell morphology. Finally, Sema3A-induced growth cone collapse of dorsal root ganglion neurons was suppressed by expression of Fes kinase-negative mutants. Taken together, our findings suggest that Fes links Sema3A signals to CRMP-CRAM, and that NP-1 negatively regulates PlexA1 activation by Fes in resting condition.
