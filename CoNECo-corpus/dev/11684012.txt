Site-specific incorporation of a phosphotyrosine mimetic reveals a role for tyrosine phosphorylation of SHP-2 in cell signaling. 
The regulation of protein tyrosine phosphatase (PTPase) SHP-2 is proposed to involve tyrosine phosphorylation on two tail tyrosine residues. Using "expressed protein ligation", nonhydrolyzable phosphotyrosine analogs were introduced at known phosphorylation sites in SHP-2. Biochemical analysis suggests that a phosphonate at Tyr542 interacts intramolecularly with the N-terminal SH2 domain to relieve basal inhibition of the PTPase, whereas a phosphonate at Tyr-580 stimulates the PTPase activity by interaction with the C-terminal SH2 domain. Microinjection experiments indicate that a single phosphorylation of Tyr-542 of SHP-2 is sufficient to activate the MAP kinase pathway in living cells. These studies support a novel mechanism explaining how tyrosine phosphorylation of a PTPase is important in signal transduction.
