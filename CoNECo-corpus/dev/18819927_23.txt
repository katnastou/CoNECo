A screen for BCA2 interacting proteins was performed using the BacterioMatch II Two-Hybrid System (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Full-length human BCA2 cDNA was cloned as a NotI-SalI fragment from FLAG-tagged pCMV-BCA2 into the NotI-XhoI digested bait vector, pBT. The BacterioMatch human breast and fetal brain cDNA libraries constructed by pTRG vector were purchased from Stratagene. Cotransformants were screened by using medium lacking histidine and containing 5 mM 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole, as recommended by the manufacturer. The plates were incubated at 37degreesC for 24hrs and then at room temperature for 24hrs to detect weak interactors. Positive interactions were further confirmed by activation of the streptomycin resistance gene on selective plates. For negative controls, empty pBT and pTRG plasmids were co-transformed with pTRG library and pBT-BCA2, respectively. A positive control included the co-transformation of pBT-LGF2 and pTRG-Gal11, provided by Stratagene. DNA sequencing reactions of the respective inserts in pTRG vector were performed at the Sunnybrook Research Institute Genomic Core Facility. A BLAST search at the NCBI website was performed to identify proteins encoded by the respective cDNAs.
