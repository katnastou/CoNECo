Here, we report the results of our investigation of the mechanisms by which Catsup mutations can enhance BH4 and DA synthesis and yet simultaneously confer neuroprotection against PQ-induced oxidative insult. We find that Catsup acts to negatively regulate BH4 and DA synthesis pathways through physical interactions with the rate-limiting enzymes of both pathways, GTP cyclohydrolase I (GTPCH; EC3.5.4.16) and TH, respectively. Moreover, we provide evidence that Catsup is localized to synaptic termini and acts as a negative regulator of vesicular monoamine transporter (VMAT), which is responsible for synaptic vesicle uptake of DA. We conclude that Catsup has the ability to regulate DA homeostasis by effectively integrating the synthesis of both the BH4 and DA pathways through their respective rate-limiting enzymes, with the transport and synaptic release of DA.
