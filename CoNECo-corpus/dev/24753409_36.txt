We tested the interaction of unmodified and sumoylated Rad1-Rad10 with both Y-form DNA and dsDNA, which mimic the substrate and product of the nucleolysis reaction, respectively. We found that unmodified Rad1-Rad10 binds to both dsDNA and Y-forms (Figure 5C and D. Although Rad1-Rad10 is thought to be released from DNA after cleavage simply by intrinsic differences in the enzyme's affinity for different forms of DNA, we found that Rad1-Rad10 interaction with dsDNA is only slightly weaker than that with Y-forms. This result suggests that additional regulation exists to enable efficient dissociation of Rad1-Rad10 from dsDNA. Consistent with this, the excised oligomer in NER is released at a faster rate in vivo than in vitro, implying the existence of regulatory mechanisms specifically for achieving shorter turnaround times in NER in vivo.
