To date, animal models of Dup15q focused on neuronal overexpression of UBE3A have failed to recapitulate the seizure phenotypes observed in Dup15q. Our fly model of Dup15q with elevated levels of Dube3a in glia, but not neurons, displays a robust seizure phenotype, highlighting the previously unappreciated role that glial play in Dup15q pathophysiology. Our lab previously demonstrated that Dube3a is biallelically expressed in the Drosophila brain, and here we demonstrate that Drosophila glia endogenously express Dube3a in addition to expression in neurons. Studies in mammalian systems have indicated biallelic expression of Ube3a/UBE3A in glial cells, yet until now the functional consequence of overexpression of Ube3a/Dube3a in glial cells has been largely unexplored. Increased dosage of the E3 ubiquitin ligase UBE3A is thought to be the underlying cause of at least the autistic features of Dup15q syndrome, and evidence presented here suggests that elevated UBE3A contributes to epilepsy in Dup15q as well.
