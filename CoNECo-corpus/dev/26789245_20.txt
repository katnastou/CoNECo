Sedimentation equilibrium experiments were performed in a ProteomeLab XL-I (Beckman Coulter) analytical ultracentrifuge. HOIP-RBR/UbcH5B~ubiquitin as used for crystallization was loaded into a 6-channel equilibrium cell at 5.0, 2.5 and 1.25 muM concentration and centrifuged at 10,000 rpm, 20degreesC in an An-50 Ti 8-place rotor until equilibrium was achieved. Data were analysed using HeteroAnalysis software (J.L. Cole and J.W. Lary, University of Connecticut; http://www.biotech.uconn.edu/auf/).
