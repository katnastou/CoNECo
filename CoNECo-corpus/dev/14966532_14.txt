(A and B) Lefty1 interacts with Cripto. RNAs (1 ng each) encoding ActRIIB(KR)/Myc, Alk4(KR)/Flag, Cripto/Flag, Lefty1/HA, or Sqt/HA were injected into Xenopus embryos. After chemical cross-linking, lysates were immunoprecipitated for either Lefty1/HA or Sqt/HA (A) with anti-HA antibody, or ActRIIB(KR)/Myc, Alk4(KR)/HA, Cripto/Flag (B) with, respectively, anti-Myc, anti-HA, or anti-Flag antibodies. Note that Lefty1 specifically interacts with Cripto (A and B), and these Lefty/Cripto complexes do not contain Alk4 (A). Moreover, processed Lefty1 binds much more efficiently to Cripto than full-length Lefty1 precursor (B). In contrast, Sqt can bind to ActRIIB, Alk4, and Cripto (A). The 55 kDa protein marker in (B) is estimated based on molecular weight markers.
