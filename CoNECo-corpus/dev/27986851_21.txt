Characterization of the interaction between Trm11 and Trm112. (A) ITC of Trm112 binding to Trm11. Upper panel: ITC data obtained by injecting Trm112 into Trm11. Lower panel shows the fit to the binding curve with resulting affinity (Kd) and stoichiometry (N). (B) Hydrogen-Deuterium exchange monitored on the doubly charged peptide 202-213 from Trm11, alone (left, black) or in the presence of Trm112 (right, gray) at 0, 0.5, 1, 5, 10 and 30 min (bottom to the top). (C) HDX kinetics of three representative peptides from Trm11 (top and middle) and Trm112 (bottom). Black circles and gray boxes correspond to data extracted from isolated and complexed forms, respectively. The error bars represent standard deviations from the mean of three replicates. (D) Differential HDX heat map for free Trm11 compared to Trm11 bound to Trm112. Colored from 0% (blue) to 40% (red) difference of deuterium uptake after 5 min (Left). Secondary structure elements as observed in our model of the Trm11 protein structure are shown above the sequence. (Right) Mapping of differential heat map at the surface of the Trm11 model structure using the same color code. Residues in gray were not covered by peptide mapping. (E) Differential HDX heat map for free Trm112 compared to Trm112 bound to Trm11. Colored from 0% (blue) to 40% (red) difference of deuterium uptake after 5 min. Trm112 secondary structure elements as observed in Saccharomyces cerevisiae Bud23-Trm112 crystal structure are shown above the sequence. Trm112 residues that are involved in the interaction with Bud23 MTase are identified by black stars below the sequence. Residues not covered by peptide mapping are shown in gray. (F) Mapping of the distribution of residues at the surface of the model of Trm11 structure. Residues color code: hydrophobic aromatic and aliphatic (G, A, V, L, I, F, Y, W, M and P) in white, positively charged (K and R) in blue, negatively charged (D and E) in red, polar (N, Q, H, S and T) in cyan. Same orientation as panel D. The hydrophobic patch is delineated by black dotted lines. (G) Ribbon representation of the model of the Trm11-Trm112 complex, considering that Trm11 interacts with Trm112 in a similar way as Bud23. Trm112 is colored purple while Trm11 THUMP and MTase domains are colored light brown and green, respectively. The zinc atom bound to Trm112 is shown as a cyan sphere. A SAM molecule bound to the Trm11 MTase domain is shown as yellow sticks. Side chains from Trm11 Asp286 and Trm112 Arg53 are shown as ball and sticks. (H) Mapping of differential HDX heat map (after 5 min) on the ribbon representation of the Trm11-Trm112 complex. Colored from 0% (blue) to 40% (red) difference of deuterium uptake. Same orientation as panel G. Residues not covered by peptide mapping are shown in gray.
