Rex1p is a unique exonuclease for 5S rRNA trimming. However, both the rex1Delta strain and the rex1-1 strain are indistinguishable from wild type in growth in spite of accumulating 3'-extended 5S rRNA. This indicates that 3'-extended 5S rRNA can be normally assembled into the 60S ribosomal subunits. Nevertheless, 3'-extended 5S rRNA causes significant growth defect under the rrs1-5 background. The result suggests that normal function of Rrs1p is required for the assembly of 5S rRNA into the 60S ribosomal subunit as well as for the assembly of L11. RPL5 encoding a ribosomal protein L5 was cloned as a weak suppressor of rrs1-5 rex1-1. It was suggested that L5 protects nascent 5S rRNA and recruits 5S rRNA to ribosomal particles. Since it appears that extended 5S rRNA is not degraded in rex1-1 or rex1Delta strains, it is likely that excess L5 suppresses the rex1-1 mutation by recruiting 5S rRNA. Either rpl11aDelta or rpl11bDelta, which results in a decreased level of L11, did not cause a synthetic growth defect with rrs1-5, suggesting that a decreased level of a component of ribosome does not cause a synthetic defect with rrs1 (T. Okada and K. Mizuta, unpublished data). Our results suggest that the recruitment of L11 and that of L5/5S rRNA are highly coordinated and that leucine at 65 in Rrs1p is critical for Rrs1p-L5 and Rrs1p-L11 interactions. We performed tandem affinity purification and detected both L11 and L5 in the fraction purified with Rrs1p-TAP (K. Ehara and K. Mizuta, unpublished data). It remains to be elucidated if both L5/5S rRNA and L11 are recruited into pre-ribosomal particles at the same time, or if assembly of one component followed by conformational rearrangement of the particle is required for assembly of the other component.
