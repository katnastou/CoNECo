Lipid transport in blood is accomplished by lipoproteins, nanometer-scale emulsions of lipid and protein that solve the fundamental oil-in-water solubility problem. One lipoprotein class, high-density lipoproteins (HDL), has been intensively studied due to its association with various cardioprotective functions (recently reviewed in). HDL proteins, called apolipoproteins, include (apo)A-I, apoA-II, apoA-IV, and many less abundant species (;;). Many of these can interconvert between a soluble lipid-free state and the lipid-bound form, with the lipid-free form able to interact with the cell surface ATP binding cassette transporter (ABCA1) to produce HDL particles. Unfortunately, the details of this process are poorly understood, largely because the basic structures of both the lipid-free and -bound forms of most HDL apolipoproteins have not been clearly determined.
