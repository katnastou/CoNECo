Molecular cloning and characterization of an isoprenylated 67 kDa protein. 
The cDNA coding for a 67 kDa protein (p67) was isolated from a rat Schwann cell library. A recombinant form of p67 expressed in bacteria was used to produce polyclonal anti-p67 antibodies. By immunoblot analysis p67 was found to be expressed in most tissues and cell lines examined. Inspection of the deduced amino acid sequence revealed a COOH-terminal consensus sequence for isoprenylation. Consistent with this finding, p67 was a substrate for isoprenylation in vitro by geranylgeranylpyrophosphate. p67 was associated predominantly with the particulate fraction of rat smooth muscle cells. The rat p67 sequence was highly homologous to a family of recently described human and mouse gamma-interferon inducible, guanine nucleotide binding proteins.
