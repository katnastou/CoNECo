In a previous large-scale screening of a yeast deletion array, it was found that deleting NEM1 or SPO7 significantly enhanced BMV replication. In addition, deletion of PAH1 facilitates robust RNA replication of tomato bushy stunt virus (TBSV). TBSV normally replicates in peroxisomes but assemble their VRCs at expanded ER membranes in pah1Delta cells. In addition, TBSV VRCs in pah1Delta cells are more active than those in wt cells.
