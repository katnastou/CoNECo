In order to elucidate the physiological and pathological roles of SHP2, we set out to investigate SHP2 substrates by combining a substrate-trapping technique and mass spectrometry. This was enabled, in part, by our recent isolation of a T507K mutant of SHP2 (SHP2-T507K) from a hepatocellular carcinoma. This mutation affects the phosphatase domain, but results in only a slightly elevated basal phosphatase activity, as assayed by its effects on the p-nitrophenylphosphate (pNPP) substrate. However, in sharp contrast with the SHP2 mutants associated with Noonan syndrome and JMML, the SHP2-T507K point mutant confers anchorage-independent growth and in vivo tumorigenesis when the mutant allele is introduced into NIH3T3 mouse fibroblast cells. These findings raised the possibility either that the SHP2-T507K mutant protein had an enhanced activity toward a selected subset of SHP2 substrates or that the mutant enzyme acquired a new substrate specificity that potentiated its oncogenic activity.
