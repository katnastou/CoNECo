Processing of the gastrin precursor. Modulation of phosphorylated, sulfated, and amidated products. 
Post-translational processing of the precursor for rat gastrin yields products that include peptides phosphorylated at Ser96, amidated at Phe92, and sulfated at Tyr87 or Tyr103. The phosphorylation site is immediately adjacent to the processing point that gives rise to the biologically active amidated gastrins. We have examined changes in post-translational processing which occur in gastrin cells from rats that are physiologically stimulated (by feeding) or unstimulated (by fasting). Peptides were identified using site-directed radioimmunoassays and chromatographic systems that resolve phosphorylated, amidated, and sulfated progastrin products, including intermediates generated prior to amidation (i.e. C-terminal glycine-extended variants). Assays for Phe92-amidated peptides and for the C-terminal tryptic fragment of progastrin indicated decreases in the total tissue concentrations of immunoreactive peptide with fasting; in contrast, the tissue concentrations of glycine-extended biosynthetic intermediates were similar in fasted and fed rats. Taken together the data suggest a relative failure in amidation mechanisms in unstimulated cells. The endopeptidase cleavage of progastrin was not influenced significantly by fasting. However, the phosphorylation of peptide products containing Ser96 was depressed significantly in fasted rats. The proportions of amidated peptides sulfated at Tyr87 were generally lower than their corresponding glycine-extended biosynthetic precursors, but in both cases the proportion of peptide in the sulfated form was lower than for peptides sulfated at Tyr103. Feeding did not change the sulfation of amidated heptadecapeptide gastrin or its glycine-extended variant. The results suggest that the mechanisms determining phosphorylation and amidation of progastrin-related peptides depend on the patterns of stimulation of gastrin cells. The observation that decreased phosphorylation is associated with a failure to produce active amidated products is consistent with a regulatory function for phosphorylation in gastrin production.
