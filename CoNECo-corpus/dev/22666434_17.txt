Confocal images of S2R+ cells expressing DmRad9A mutated in suspected NLS sequences. (A) DmRad9A mutated at position 287 - 289 (NLS1). (D) DmRad9A mutated Position 300-302 (NLS2). (G) DmRad9A mutated Position 314-316 (NLS3). (B, E and H) stained with anti-lamin antibodies, which mark the nuclear membrane, in red. (C) Merged image of (A) and (B). (F) Merged image of (D) and (E). (I) Merged image of (G) and (H).
