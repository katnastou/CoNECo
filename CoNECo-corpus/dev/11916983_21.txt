The site of Kes1p proteolysis that generates Kes1pW317A* was determined. Matrix-assisted laser ionization coupled with time-of-flight mass analysis (MALDI-TOF) analyses yield a mass of 50.663 kD for Kes1p and 36.838 kD for Kes1pW317A* (Fig. 4 B). These data assigned the Kes1pW317A* cleavage site to the amide bond of a dibasic motif comprised of Kes1p residues R314 and K315, indicating that Kes1pW317A* is devoid of the COOH-terminal 120 residues (Fig. 4 B). Interestingly, this cleavage site lies upstream of the W317A substitution. Thus, Kes1pW317A* represents a proteolytic fragment consisting solely of wild-type Kes1p primary sequence.
