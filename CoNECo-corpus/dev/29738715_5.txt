Budding yeast cells employ amyloid-like structures to control translation during meiosis. At the core of these structures is the RNA-binding protein Rim4. Rim4 is essential for meiosis and contains three N-terminal RNA-recognition motifs (RRMs) and two intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs). Rim4 also harbors a prion-like domain within its asparagine and proline-rich C-terminal IDR which is algorithmically-defined based on disorder and sequence similarity to yeast prions. During pre-meiotic G1, Rim4 aggregates into heterogeneously-sized multimeric structures that are resistant to the harsh detergent SDS, a hallmark property of amyloids. Based on this property we have defined Rim4 assemblies as amyloid-like. In vitro, Rim4 forms fibrils that bind thioflavin-T and contain beta-sheets. Formation and clearance of amyloid-like Rim4 is a developmentally regulated process. When Rim4 is ectopically expressed in nutrient-rich conditions, it does not form SDS-resistant multimers and is non-functional. Starvation induces conversion of Rim4 monomers into its SDS-resistant form (termed assembly). After completion of the first meiotic division, Rim4 is rapidly degraded by an unknown mechanism (termed clearance). The amyloid-like form of Rim4 is the translationally repressive form of the protein. rim4 truncation mutants that cannot form amyloid-like assemblies are defective for translational repression but retain the ability to bind RNA. Beyond yeast, amyloid-like assemblies are also critical features of mouse and frog meiosis highlighting the conserved use of these structures in sexual reproduction.
