Residues that distinguish the two distinct beta-sheet conformations are among the most conserved in the beta-sheet region of Boca/Mesd proteins. On the other hand, only a few of these residues, those from the C-terminus of beta4 and the turn into beta5, participate in the dimer interface. These observations suggest the possibility of a separate function that provides evolutionary pressure for this region. An almost invariant valine-threonine residue pair (mmMesd Val174-Thr175, dmBoca Val163-Thr164, ceBMY-1 Val165-Thr166) anchors the beta4 strand to the adjacent beta1 strand and hydrophobic core. The four residues following the threonine are also highly conserved, potentially because they must retain flexibility to form the discrete secondary structural states seen in the two conformations. The two central residues of type I' beta-turns, named i+1 and i+2, are located in the alphaL energy minima of the Ramachandran plot whereby type I' beta-turns are intrinsically less stable. Only the i+1 and i+2 residues undergo a drastic phi and phi change between the two secondary structure states seen in the crystals. The phi and phi angles of the i and i+3 beta-turn residues remain the same between the two conformational states, allowing similar backbone hydrogen bonds to form even though the i+3 residues moves ~13Aa. Both these factors may reduce the energy required to undergo the transition between the beta-turn and beta-sheet conformations. The threonine residue preceding the beta-turn may act as a conformational switch in this region, because the p and m side chain conformations correlate to the 4-strand and 5-strand beta-sheet conformations.
