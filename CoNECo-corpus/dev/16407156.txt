Point mutations in the aromatic/arginine region in aquaporin 1 allow passage of urea, glycerol, ammonia, and protons.  
Water-specific aquaporins (AQP), such as the prototypical mammalian AQP1, stringently exclude the passage of solutes, ions, and even protons. Supposedly, this is accomplished by two conserved regions within the pore, a pair of canonical asparagine-proline-alanine (NPA) motifs, the central constriction, and an aromatic/arginine (ar/R) constriction, the outer constriction. Here, we analyzed the function of three residues in the ar/R constriction (Phe-56, His-180, and Arg-195) in rat AQP1. Individual or joint replacement of His-180 and Arg-195 by alanine and valine residues, respectively (AQP1-H180A, AQP1-R195V, and AQP1-H180A/R195V), did not affect water permeability. The double mutant AQP1-H180A/R195V allowed urea to pass. In line with the predicted solute discrimination by size, replacement of both Phe-56 and His-180 (AQP1-F56A/H180A) enlarged the maximal diameter of the ar/R constriction 3-fold and enabled glycerol and urea to pass. We further show that ammonia passes through all four AQP1 mutants, as determined (i) by growth complementation of yeast deletion strains with ammonia, (ii) by ammonia uptake from the external solution into oocytes, and (iii) by direct recordings of ammonia induced proton currents in oocytes. Unexpectedly, removal of the positive charge in the ar/R constriction in AQP1-R195V and AQP1-H180A/R195V appeared to allow the passage of protons through AQP1. The data indicate that the ar/R constriction is a major checkpoint for solute permeability, and that the exquisite electrostatic proton barrier in AQPs comprises both the NPA constriction as well as the ar/R constriction.
