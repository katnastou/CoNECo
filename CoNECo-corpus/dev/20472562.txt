Low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein-1 (LRP1) regulates thrombospondin-2 (TSP2) enhancement of Notch3 signaling. 
Intracellular trafficking of Notch and Notch ligands modulates signaling, suggesting that choreography of ligand and receptor translocation is essential for optimal Notch activity. Indeed, a major model for Notch signaling posits that Notch trans-endocytosis into the ligand-expressing (signal sending) cell is a key driving force for Notch signal transduction. The extracellular protein thrombospondin-2 (TSP2) enhances Notch signaling and binds to both Jagged1 and Notch3 ectodomains, potentially bridging two essential extracellular components of Notch signaling. We investigated the role of low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein-1 (LRP1), a TSP2 receptor, in the regulation of Notch3 signaling. TSP2 potentiation of Notch is blocked by the receptor-associated protein (an inhibitor of low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein function) and requires LRP1 expression in the signal-sending cell. TSP2 stimulates Notch3 endocytosis into wild type fibroblasts but not LRP1-deficient fibroblasts. Finally, recombinant Notch3 and Jagged1 interact with the LRP1 85-kDa B-chain, a subunit that lacks known ligand binding function. Our data suggest that LRP1 and TSP2 stimulate Notch activity by driving trans-endocytosis of the Notch ectodomain into the signal-sending cell and demonstrate a novel, non-cell autonomous function of LRP1 in cell-cell signaling.
