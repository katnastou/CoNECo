Previously, we constructed an NFAT-GFP reporter cell line expressing ILT7 and FcepsilonRIgamma that expresses GFP in response to ILT7 surface ligation. To detect the presence of ILT7 ligands (ILT7-L), we used these cells to screen virus-infected cells and a large panel of human tumor cell lines. Co-culture of the ILT7 reporter cells with human breast carcinoma MDA-MB-468, MCF7, and T47D cells, but not with MDA-MB-231 or ZR-75-1 cells, induced GFP expression by the reporter cells (Fig. 1 A). We further tested several human ovarian, colon, melanoma, glioma, and lung cancer cell lines and found that two melanoma lines, WM35 and Mel938, were able to similarly activate the ILT7 reporter cells (Fig. 1 B). Other transformed cell lines, such as HEK293, Vero, CHO, Cos7, and Jurkat, were unable to stimulate the ILT7 reporter cells (unpublished data).
