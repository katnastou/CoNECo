The nup localization patterns seen after the loss of Nup170p and Nup157p provide important insights into their role in NPC assembly. We conclude that the removal of Nup170p and Nup157p does not inhibit the targeting of core and nucleoplasmic nups to the nuclear periphery or their assembly into structural precursors of the NPC, which are what we interpret the inner nuclear membrane-associated structures to represent. In contrast, Nup170p and Nup157p appear essential for the incorporation of the cytoplasmically positioned nups into NPCs. Although displaced from the NE, these nups appear to associate with known binding partners (e.g., the interaction of the Nup82p/Nup159p with the Nup84p complex) within cytoplasmic foci. These foci are likely composed of assembly intermediates, not nonspecific aggregates, as their nups remain competent to target to the NE after derepression of NUP170, and appear to assemble into NPCs (Fig. 8 C).
