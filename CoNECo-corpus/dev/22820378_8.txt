We examined whether BR response requires PIFs. Members of the PIF family play overlapping roles in promoting skotomorphogenesis and cell elongation. The quadruple mutant (pifq) lacking four PIFs (PIF1/PIL5, PIF3, PIF4 and PIF5/PIL6) exhibits a constitutive de-etiolation phenotype in the dark, characterized by short hypocotyl and open cotyledons, similar to the BR-deficient or insensitive mutants. The pifq mutant was less sensitive to exogenous brassinolide (BL, the most active form of BR) and more sensitive to BR biosynthesis inhibitor, brassinazole (BRZ) (Fig. 2a,b), suggesting that the loss of PIFs compromises BR response. However, pif4 single mutant responded to BRZ similar to wild type (Fig. 2b), indicating redundant functions of PIFs with regard to BR response. The bzr1-1D gain-of-function mutation causes constitutive dephosphorylation of BZR1 by PP2A(Ref.) and a BRZ-resistant phenotype. However, the pifq;bzr1-1D quintuple mutant had similar short hypocotyl as pifq grown on the medium with or without BRZ (Fig. 2c,d), suggesting that PIFs are required for the BZR1 promotion of hypocotyl elongation in the dark.
