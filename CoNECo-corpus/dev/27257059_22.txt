To further characterize all the mutants retaining mtDNA at the molecular level, we blocked cytoplasmic translation with cycloheximide, used a short incubation in the presence of 35S amino acids to label mitochondrial translation products and equal amounts of total proteins were subjected to SDS PAGE (Figure 2A). As expected, the three point mutants that had a compromised respiratory growth showed a lower level of labeling than the wild type. However, for the three deletion mutants, all mitochondrial translation products were detected and the Deltamif3 and Deltarrf1 strains displayed stronger labeling of Cox1, Cytb and Atp9 when compared to the wild type (Figure 2B). In the Deltaifm1 strain, Cytb and Atp9 levels were similar to the wild type while labeling of the other mitochondrial proteins was decreased. Thus, in all three deletion mutants, we observed a differential effect on the labeling of specific mitochondrial proteins.
