We used fluorescence polarization experiments to examine RNA binding and found that S. pombe Puf3PUM binds to both the ScPuf3 target and the ScPuf5 target with high affinity (Figure 4A, bottom). The affinity for the ScPuf3 motif is ~2 fold higher than for the ScPuf5 motif, but the binding affinity in both cases is in the picomolar range. Surprisingly, in deadenylation activity assays with 100 nM Puf3, we found that the ScPuf3 target was selectively deadenylated in preference to the ScPuf5 target (Figure 4B). Thus, Puf3 can distinguish between very similar RNAs and selectively target them for deadenylation by Ccr4-Not.
