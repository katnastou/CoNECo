TRAP150 activates pre-mRNA splicing. (A) The splicing report pSV40-CAT(In1) encodes the chloramphenicol acetyl transferase, in which human beta-globin intron 1 was inserted. The pSV40-CAT(In1) reporter was co-transfected with indicated siRNA into HeLa cells. RT-PCR was performed using primers specific for the reporter exons; the PCR products were analyzed by Southern blotting using primers specific for the exons (left). Splicing efficiency in individual transfectants was calculated as the intensity of the spliced RNA over the sum of the spliced RNA and the precursor. Splicing activation fold was obtained from three independent experiments. Immunoblotting using antibodies specific to indicated protein was performed to reveal knockdown efficiency (right). (B) HeLa cells were mock-transfected or transfected with si-TRAP150 (J5). The nuclear extract was prepared from transfected cells and analyzed by immunoblotting (upper). Lower panel shows that in vitro splicing using 32P-labeled PIP85a pre-mRNA in the mock- or TRAP150-depleted nuclear extract. (C) Schematic representation of full-length and truncated TRAP150 proteins. Domains are depicted as in Figure 1. The pSV40-CAT(In1) vector was co-transfected with an expression vector encoding the indicated effector into HeLa cells. PCR was performed as in (A); asterisk denotes the precursor/spliced RNA hybrid. Splicing efficiency was also calculated as in (A) and the splicing activation fold relative to the reporter only was indicated below the gel. Immunoblotting using anti-HA shows the expression level of the effectors; actin was used as the loading control.
