Purification and characterization of a smooth muscle myosin phosphatase from turkey gizzards.  
A phosphoprotein phosphatase that dephosphorylates smooth muscle myosin has been purified to apparent homogeneity from turkey gizzards. Smooth muscle phosphatase (SMP) IV has a molecular weight of 150,000 as determined by gel filtration on a Sephadex G-200 column and is composed of two subunits (Mr = 58,000 and 40,000). Although it is active toward a number of proteins, its activities toward the contractile proteins, intact myosin, heavy meromyosin, and isolated myosin light chains are higher than its activities toward phosphorylase alpha, histone IIA, and phosphorylase kinase. SMP-IV preferentially dephosphorylates the beta-subunit of phosphorylase kinase. The properties of the enzyme have been studied using heavy meromyosin, a soluble chymotryptic fragment of myosin, and isolated myosin light chains as substrates. SMP-IV has high affinity for both substrates and is optimally active at neutral pH. Divalent cations, Ca2+ and Mg2+, activate the dephosphorylation of heavy meromyosin but inhibit the activity toward myosin light chains. Low concentrations of ATP (1-5 mM) activate SMP-IV but concentrations higher than 5 mM are inhibitory. Inhibition of 50% of the activity of the enzyme by NaF and PPi requires concentrations higher than 10 mM. Rabbit skeletal muscle heat stable inhibitor-2 has no effect on the activity of SMP-IV toward heavy meromyosin, myosin light chains, and phosphorylase alpha.
