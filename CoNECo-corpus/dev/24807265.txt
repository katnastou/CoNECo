Activation of the pleiotropic drug resistance pathway can promote mitochondrial DNA retention by fusion-defective mitochondria in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. 
Genetic and microscopic approaches using Saccharomyces cerevisiae have identified many proteins that play a role in mitochondrial dynamics, but it is possible that other proteins and pathways that play a role in mitochondrial division and fusion remain to be discovered. Mutants lacking mitochondrial fusion are characterized by rapid loss of mitochondrial DNA. We took advantage of a petite-negative mutant that is unable to survive mitochondrial DNA loss to select for mutations that allow cells with fusion-deficient mitochondria to maintain the mitochondrial genome on fermentable medium. Next-generation sequencing revealed that all identified suppressor mutations not associated with known mitochondrial division components were localized to PDR1 or PDR3, which encode transcription factors promoting drug resistance. Further studies revealed that at least one, if not all, of these suppressor mutations dominantly increases resistance to known substrates of the pleiotropic drug resistance pathway. Interestingly, hyperactivation of this pathway did not significantly affect mitochondrial shape, suggesting that mitochondrial division was not greatly affected. Our results reveal an intriguing genetic connection between pleiotropic drug resistance and mitochondrial dynamics.
