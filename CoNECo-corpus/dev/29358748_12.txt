In the germline and somatic cells of developing egg chambers, Rbfox1 protein has a very distinctive expression pattern that depends on the developmental stage (Fig. 1f). This is especially evident in the follicular epithelium, which undergoes major transitions in cell cycle mode during differentiation (Fig. 1a, f). In miR-980 mutants, elevated Rbfox1 levels were detected at all developmental stages (Fig. 1g), demonstrating that miR-980 is responsible for the control of the highly dynamic Rbfox1 expression during the entire process of oogenesis.
