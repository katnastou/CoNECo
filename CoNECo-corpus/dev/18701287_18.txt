In addition, consistent with the fact that Cdc3 and Cdc12 form a stoichiometric complex that is essential for hetero-octamer formation in mitotic cells, we found that either anti-Cdc12 or anti-Cdc3 antibodies co-precipitated equivalent amounts of Cdc3 when lysates were prepared from vegetatively-dividing diploid cells, whereas anti-Cdc12 antibodies precipitated only ~25% of the amount of Cdc3 as that precipitated with the anti-Cdc3 antibodies when lysates were prepared from a sporulating culture of diploid cells (Fig. 3G and data not shown). Moreover, in the sporulating cultures used for such experiments, 25-30% of cells did not sporulate, based on the fraction of the total cells counted (n = 200 per experiment) that lacked evidence of spore formation visible by transmitted light microscopy or lacked detectable Spr3-GFP fluorescence (data not shown). This level of sporulation proficiency is nearly identical (75%) to that reported by others for this same mixed strain background. Thus, these data support our conclusion that, in sporulating cells, Cdc12 does not associate stably with Cdc3, and exists free of other septins (or is associated with Shs1, which also is excluded from spore-associated structures).
