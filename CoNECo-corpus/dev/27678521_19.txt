Studies have indicated that the AAA+-type ATPase Pch2 suppresses intersister repair to some extent, and helps to prevent meiotic progression when unrepaired DSBs accumulate. We found that deletion of PCH2 relieved the dmc1increment-dependent inhibition of DNA rereplication in our SIC1incrementPHA system (Figure S3), indicating that PCH2 aided in preventing DNA rereplication. In this case, as in certain other mutants analyzed (see below), few cells with DNA content >~8C were observed. Extensive DNA rereplication was detected with SIC1incrementPHApch2increment cells (Figure S1 and Figure S3), indicating that PCH2 itself was not required for the DNA rereplication phenotype in SIC1incrementPHA cells.
