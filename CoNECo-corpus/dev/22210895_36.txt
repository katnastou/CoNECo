Based on our results, it was speculated that TTP induces let-7b level through down-regulation of Lin28a. To confirm this hypothesis, we first determined whether knockdown of Lin28a by siRNA enhanced let-7b expression in PA1 cells. Western blot analysis confirmed the inhibition of Lin28a expression in PA1 cells (PA1/Lin28a-siRNA) by siRNA treatment (Figure 6A). As expected, let-7b expression level in PA1/Lin28a-siRNA was increased compared to PA1 cells treated with control siRNA (PA1/scRNA) (Figure 6B). In addition, inhibition of Lin28a decreased the level of CDC34 (Figure 6C). To confirm the involvement of Lin28a for the TTP-induced increase of let-7b level, we co-transfected PA1 cells with pcDNA6/V5-TTP and pcDNA3/Flag-Lin28a, which does not contain the Lin28a 3'-UTR. At 24-h post-transfection, cells were analyzed for the expression of let-7b, CDC34 and proliferation. Overexpression of Lin28a (Figure 6D) abrogated the effect of TTP on the expression of let-7b and CDC34 (Figure 6E). In addition, overexpression of Lin28a restored the growth of PA1/TTP to 87% of PA1/pcDNA (Figure 6F). These results indicate that TTP affects the expression level of let-7b and CDC34 and the cell growth through down-regulation of Lin28a in PA1 cells.
