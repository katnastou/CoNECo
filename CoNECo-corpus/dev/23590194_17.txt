Rap1 leads to cellular lethality, we utilized the rap1-17 allele that encodes a Rap1 protein with C-terminal truncation (missing amino acids 663-827). The rap1-17 mutant is incapable of interacting Rif1 and Rif2, but efficiently binds to telomere DNA. As shown in Fig. 4C, the tsa1 rap1-17 double mutant had a similar telomere length as the rap1-17 single mutant, supporting that Rap1 is required for telomere lengthening in the tsa1 mutant. Similarly, the tsa1 rif2 double mutant displayed a similar telomere length as the rif2 single mutant (Fig. 4D), implying the importance of Rif2 in telomere lengthening in the tsa1 mutant. Interestingly, telomere length of the tsa1 rif1 double mutant is significantly longer than that of the rif1 single mutant, suggesting that tsa1 and rif1 mutations causes telomere lengthening via distinct pathways.
