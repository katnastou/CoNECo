The effect of those alterations in the endocytic machinery on bulk lipid endocytosis was assessed by observing FM4-64 uptake in mixed cultures from a control strain bearing the spindle pole body protein Sad1-GFP and the 41XHAclc1 strain. The cultures were incubated in the absence or the presence of thiamine; photographs were taken 0, 2, and 30 minutes after the addition of the dye (figure 7 D. The experiment was performed three times with similar results). In the absence of thiamine, FM4-64 was observed at the cell surface at the 0-minute time-point, in internal endosomes after 2 minutes, and in the vacuoles after 30 minutes in the wild-type and mutant strains (cells bearing and lacking the green Sad1-GFP dots, respectively). When cells were incubated for 6 hours in the presence of thiamine, FM4-64 stained the cell surface of both strains at the beginning of the experiment (0'); after 2 minutes, the dye was observed inside the wild-type cells (marked by the green Sad1-GFP dots) but not inside the mutant cells (those lacking the GFP dot); after 30 minutes of incubation, FM4-64 was observed in the vacuoles of the control strain. Under these conditions, the dye was still detected at the cell surface in the mutant cells; only a weak staining was observed inside some cells (arrows in the corresponding panel of figure 7 D). Thus, a 40% reduction in the amount of Clc1p did not affect FM4-64 uptake, and a 90% reduction in this protein delayed this process, but did not abrogate it.
